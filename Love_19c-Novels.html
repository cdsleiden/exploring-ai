I took that _here_”—he tapped his heart.
Yes, she was in love.
“Who was it she was in love with?” “The story will tell,” I took upon myself to reply.
“Well, if I don’t know who she was in love with, I know who _he_ was.” “She was ten years older,” said her husband.
But as my little conductress, with her hair of gold and her frock of blue, danced before me round corners and pattered down passages, I had the view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy sprite, such a place as would somehow, for diversion of the young idea, take all color out of storybooks and fairytales.
She expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable duties, looking to me, however, with a great childish light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had conceived for my person, which had rendered necessary that she should follow me.
I needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of Mrs. Grose’s comparison, and, catching my pupil in my arms, covered her with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement.
What I then and there took him to my heart for was something divine that I have never found to the same degree in any child—his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but love.
“Would you mind, miss, if I used the freedom—” “To kiss me?
I was lifted aloft on a great wave of infatuation and pity.
They had the bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything, to be right, would have to be enclosed and protected, the only form that, in my fancy, the afteryears could take for them was that of a romantic, a really royal extension of the garden and the park.
They flanked opposite ends of the house and were probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious, dating, in their gingerbread antiquity, from a romantic revival that was already a respectable past.
The attraction of my small charges was a constant joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears, the distaste I had begun by entertaining for the probable gray prose of my office.
It was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom.
I could take the air in the court, at least, and there Mrs. Grose could join me.
I was there to protect and defend the little creatures in the world the most bereaved and the most lovable, the appeal of whose helplessness had suddenly become only too explicit, a deep, constant ache of one’s own committed heart.
My heart had stood still for an instant with the wonder and terror of the question whether she too would see; and I held my breath while I waited for what a cry from her, what some sudden innocent sign either of interest or of alarm, would tell me.
I couldn’t abjure for merely wanting to, but I could repeat to Mrs. Grose—as I did there, over and over, in the small hours—that with their voices in the air, their pressure on one’s heart, and their fragrant faces against one’s cheek, everything fell to the ground but their incapacity and their beauty.
He has _not_ literally ‘ever,’ in these weeks that I myself have lived with him and so closely watched him; he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful, lovable goodness.
There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, I found myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart.
They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me; which, after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response in children perpetually bowed over and hugged.
They had never, I think, wanted to do so many things for their poor protectress; I mean—though they got their lessons better and better, which was naturally what would please her most—in the way of diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling her stories, acting her charades, pouncing out at her, in disguises, as animals and historical characters, and above all astonishing her by the “pieces” they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite.
They got their little tasks as if they loved them, and indulged, from the mere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed little miracles of memory.
We lived in a cloud of music and love and success and private theatricals.
There came suddenly an hour after which, as I look back, the affair seems to me to have been all pure suffering; but I have at least reached the heart of it, and the straightest road out is doubtless to advance.
“If I tell you why, will you understand?” My heart, at this, leaped into my mouth.
“Well,” he said at last, “just exactly in order that you should do this.” “Do what?” “Think me—for a change—_bad!_” I shall never forget the sweetness and gaiety with which he brought out the word, nor how, on top of it, he bent forward and kissed me.
I met his kiss and I had to make, while I folded him for a minute in my arms, the most stupendous effort not to cry.
Then, after another embrace, the incident and our interview closed on my recognition of all the reserves of goodness that, for his joke, he had been able to draw upon.
“But for what?” “For the love of all the evil that, in those dreadful days, the pair put into them.
“Don’t they do enough?” I demanded in a lower tone, while the children, having smiled and nodded and kissed hands to us, resumed their exhibition.
It was striking of the children, at all events, to kiss me inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and never to fail—one or the other—of the precious question that had helped us through many a peril.
Seated at my own table in clear noonday light I saw a person whom, without my previous experience, I should have taken at the first blush for some housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the place and who, availing herself of rare relief from observation and of the schoolroom table and my pens, ink, and paper, had applied herself to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart.
Something in his tone and the expression of his face, as I got this from him, set my heart aching with such a pang as it had never yet known; so unutterably touching was it to see his little brain puzzled and his little resources taxed to play, under the spell laid on him, a part of innocence and consistency.
“Dear little Miles, dear little Miles—!” My face was close to his, and he let me kiss him, simply taking it with indulgent good humor.
It was exactly as if they had both had at heart to gloss over any recent little friction.
It was literally a charming exhibition of tact, of magnanimity, and quite tantamount to his saying outright: “The true knights we love to read about never push an advantage too far.
The usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the house, but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever Flora might be, she was not near home.
Mrs. Grose was the first to break the spell: she threw herself on her knees and, drawing the child to her breast, clasped in a long embrace the little tender, yielding body.
Much as I had made of the fact that this name had never once, between us, been sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the child’s face now received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a pane of glass.
_We_ know, don’t we, love?”—and she appealed, blundering in, to the child.
I don’t like you!” Then, after this deliverance, which might have been that of a vulgarly pert little girl in the street, she hugged Mrs. Grose more closely and buried in her skirts the dreadful little face.
“And did it come?” “No, though I waited and waited, I confess it didn’t, and it was without a breach of the silence or so much as a faint allusion to his sister’s condition and absence that we at last kissed for good night.
And if he’s saved—” “Then _you_ are?” The dear woman kissed me on this, and I took her farewell.
So, for the benefit of whom it might concern, I paraded with a sick heart.
“Yes—I took it.” At this, with a moan of joy, I enfolded, I drew him close; and while I held him to my breast, where I could feel in the sudden fever of his little body the tremendous pulse of his little heart, I kept my eyes on the thing at the window and saw it move and shift its posture.
I kissed his forehead; it was drenched.
We were alone with the quiet day, and his little heart, dispossessed, had stopped.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>It made no serious impression on any of us except my cousin—whose love of the marvellous induced him to believe it.
It was in the court outside the treasury that my cousin and I met, to enforce the laws of discipline on our own soldiers.
There I lived till Miss Julia married the late Sir John Verinder.
An excellent man, who only wanted somebody to manage him; and, between ourselves, he found somebody to do it; and what is more, he throve on it and grew fat on it, and lived happy and died easy on it, dating from the day when my lady took him to church to be married, to the day when she relieved him of his last breath, and closed his eyes for ever.
Pension him liberally, and let Gabriel Betteredge have his place.” On the Tuesday as it might be, Sir John says, “My lady, the bailiff is pensioned liberally; and Gabriel Betteredge has got his place.” You hear more than enough of married people living together miserably.
Selina Goby was all right in both these respects, which was one reason for marrying her.
Economy—with a dash of love.
“I have been turning Selina Goby over in my mind,” I said, “and I think, my lady, it will be cheaper to marry her than to keep her.” My lady burst out laughing, and said she didn’t know which to be most shocked at—my language or my principles.
That is married life, according to my experience of it.
Before I had occupied myself with that extraordinary book five minutes, I came on a comforting bit (page one hundred and fifty-eight), as follows: “Today we love, what tomorrow we hate.” I saw my way clear directly.
In two words, this was how the thing happened: My lady’s eldest sister married the celebrated Mr. Blake—equally famous for his great riches, and his great suit at law.
Concluding to set myself in the warm summer air next—seeing that what is good for old claret is equally good for old age—I took up my beehive chair to go out into the back court, when I was stopped by hearing a sound like the soft beating of a drum, on the terrace in front of my lady’s residence.
On my side, I returned to my beehive chair, and set myself down on the sunny side of the court, and fell (if the truth must be owned), not exactly into a sleep, but into the next best thing to it.
And then the chief Indian, who spoke English, said to the boy, “Hold out your hand.” On hearing those dreadful words, my daughter Penelope said she didn’t know what prevented her heart from flying straight out of her.
The matron, seeing my lady took an interest in the place, pointed out a girl to her, named Rosanna Spearman, and told her a most miserable story, which I haven’t the heart to repeat here; for I don’t like to be made wretched without any use, and no more do you.
But, somehow, she failed to make friends among the other women servants, excepting my daughter Penelope, who was always kind to Rosanna, though never intimate with her.
She had nice brown eyes, plain as she was in other ways—and she looked at me with a sort of respect for my happy old age and my good character, as things for ever out of her own reach, which made my heart heavy for our second housemaid.
Before I could get on my legs, he plumped down on the sand by the side of me, put his arm round my neck, foreign fashion, and gave me a hug that fairly squeezed the breath out of my body.
What did the jugglers do?” I was something dissatisfied with my daughter—not for letting Mr. Franklin kiss her; Mr. Franklin was welcome to _that_—but for forcing me to tell her foolish story at second hand.
He came back with a character that closed the doors of all his family against him, my lady (then just married) taking the lead, and declaring (with Sir John’s approval, of course) that her brother should never enter any house of hers.
The men wouldn’t let him into their clubs; the women—more than one—whom he wanted to marry, refused him; friends and relations got too near-sighted to see him in the street.
Nothing in this world, Betteredge, is probable unless it appeals to our own trumpery experience; and we only believe in a romance when we see it in a newspaper.” It was plain to me from this, that Mr. Franklin thought his father’s notion about the Colonel hasty and wrong.
Its size made it a phenomenon in the diamond market; its colour placed it in a category by itself; and, to add to these elements of uncertainty, there was a defect, in the shape of a flaw, in the very heart of the stone.
In bringing the Moonstone to my aunt’s house, am I serving his vengeance blindfold, or am I vindicating him in the character of a penitent and Christian man?” “It seems hard to say, sir,” I answered, “that he died with a horrid revenge in his heart, and a horrid lie on his lips.
If you were in my place, Betteredge, tell me, in one word, what would you do?” In one word, I told him: “Wait.” “With all my heart,” says Mr. Franklin.
Try that sort of answer when your wife or your daughter next worries you with an awkward question at an awkward time, and depend on the natural sweetness of women for kissing and making it up again at the next opportunity.
In came Penelope—with the natural sweetness of women—to kiss and make it up again; and—with the natural curiosity of women—to ask another question.
Rosanna has fallen in love with Mr. Franklin Blake at first sight!” You have heard of beautiful young ladies falling in love at first sight, and have thought it natural enough.
But a housemaid out of a reformatory, with a plain face and a deformed shoulder, falling in love, at first sight, with a gentleman who comes on a visit to her mistress’s house, match me that, in the way of an absurdity, out of any story-book in Christendom, if you can!
Miss Rachel then covered the surface, under his directions and with his help, with patterns and devices—griffins, birds, flowers, cupids, and such like—copied from designs made by a famous Italian painter, whose name escapes me: the one, I mean, who stocked the world with Virgin Maries, and had a sweetheart at the baker’s.
Others (led by me) admitted it was likely enough Miss Rachel might be married; but we doubted (for reasons which will presently appear) whether her bridegroom would be Mr. Franklin Blake.
That Mr. Franklin was in love, on his side, nobody who saw and heard him could doubt.
In little things and great, with people she loved, and people she hated (and she did both with equal heartiness), Miss Rachel always went on a way of her own, sufficient for herself in the joys and sorrows of her life.
I can call to mind, in her childhood, more than one occasion when the good little soul took the blame, and suffered the punishment, for some fault committed by a playfellow whom she loved.
If your good lady doesn’t exhibit something in the shape of a contradiction in that time, Heaven help you!—you have married a monster.
This was the fortunate individual on whom I believed her heart to be privately set!
My lady’s second sister (don’t be alarmed; we are not going very deep into family matters this time)—my lady’s second sister, I say, had a disappointment in love; and taking a husband afterwards, on the neck or nothing principle, made what they call a misalliance.
There was terrible work in the family when the Honourable Caroline insisted on marrying plain Mr. Ablewhite, the banker at Frizinghall.
He loved everybody.
And everybody loved _him_.
Penelope’s notion that her fellow-servant was in love with Mr. Franklin (which my daughter, by my orders, kept strictly secret) seemed to be just as absurd as ever.
An elegant little casket in china accompanied the note, presented to Miss Rachel, with her cousin’s love and best wishes.
Whether he had been trying to make love to his cousin again, and had got a rebuff—or whether his broken rest, night after night, was aggravating the queer contradictions and uncertainties in his character—I don’t know.
As I went out, Mr. Godfrey said, “Dear old Betteredge, I have the truest regard for him!” He was embracing his sisters, and ogling Miss Rachel, while he honoured me with that testimony of affection.
Something like a stock of love to draw on _there!_ Mr. Franklin was a perfect savage by comparison with him.
She gave me a kiss on the top of my bald head, and whispered, “News for you, father!
He kissed it, which _I_ should have considered taking a liberty, and then she left him.
Those two sat on either side of Miss Rachel, who, as queen of the day, was naturally the great attraction of the party.
Take one sample of the way in which he went on, and you will understand what I had to put up with at the sideboard, officiating as I was in the character of a man who had the prosperity of the festival at heart.
She dropped her head, and said in a very low voice, “My beloved husband is no more.” Unluckily Mr. Candy, hearing nothing, and miles away from suspecting the truth, went on across the table louder and politer than ever.
“The Professor may not be aware,” says he, “that the card of a member of the College will admit him, on any day but Sunday, between the hours of ten and four.” Mrs. Threadgall dropped her head right into her tucker, and, in a lower voice still, repeated the solemn words, “My beloved husband is no more.” I winked hard at Mr. Candy across the table.
Religion (I understand Mr. Godfrey to say, between the corks and the carving) meant love.
And love meant religion.
What do you think, for instance, of his discussing the lengths to which a married woman might let her admiration go for a man who was not her husband, and putting it in his clear-headed witty French way to the maiden aunt of the Vicar of Frizinghall?
Before you could say, “Lord bless us!” the rogues were making their salaams; and the Bouncers were kissing the pretty little boy.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>She next turned to Miss Rachel, and kissed her.
The worthy magistrate was an old friend of my lady’s, and the Indians were “committed” for a week, as soon as the court opened that morning.
The poor thing is breaking her heart about Mr. Franklin Blake.” Here was another view of the girl’s conduct.
As for me, I hadn’t even heart enough to open my _Robinson Crusoe_.
“I am Sergeant Cuff, miss, of the Detective Police.” “Do you think a young lady’s advice worth having?” “I shall be glad to hear it, miss.” “Do your duty by yourself—and don’t allow Mr Franklin Blake to help you!” She said those words so spitefully, so savagely, with such an extraordinary outbreak of ill-will towards Mr. Franklin, in her voice and in her look, that—though I had known her from a baby, though I loved and honoured her next to my lady herself—I was ashamed of Miss Rachel for the first time in my life.
My lady rallied a little after having opened her heart to me—being, naturally, a woman of a high courage, as I have already told you.
“I am sorry to put you to any inconvenience, sir, for a mere formality; but the example of their betters will do wonders in reconciling the servants to this inquiry.” Mr. Godfrey, after taking leave of my lady, in a most sympathising manner, left a farewell message for Miss Rachel, the terms of which made it clear to my mind that he had not taken No for an answer, and that he meant to put the marriage question to her once more, at the next opportunity.
“It isn’t very likely, with her personal appearance, that she has got a lover.
But, for the girl’s own sake, I must ask you at once whether _she_ has provided herself with a sweetheart, poor wretch, like the rest of them?” What on earth did he mean, under present circumstances, by putting such a question to me as that?
“When you said ‘Hullo’?” “Yes—when I said ‘Hullo!’ If there’s a sweetheart in the case, the hiding doesn’t much matter.
Out of pure pity for the girl—on my soul and my character, out of pure pity for the girl—I gave the Sergeant the necessary explanations, and told him that Rosanna had been mad enough to set her heart on Mr. Franklin Blake.
“The falling in love with a gentleman of Mr. Franklin Blake’s manners and appearance doesn’t seem to _me_ to be the maddest part of her conduct by any means.
It goes to my heart to break them off the stem.
Just as it goes to your heart, you know, when there’s something wrong in the servants’ hall.
He must have been crossed in love, father, when he was a young man.” The first housemaid followed Penelope.
Report, on coming out: “Sergeant Cuff has a heart; _he_ doesn’t cut jokes, Mr. Betteredge, with a poor hard-working girl.” Going into the Court of Justice, when it was all over, to hear if there were any further commands for me, I found the Sergeant at his old trick—looking out of window, and whistling “The Last Rose of Summer” to himself.
I followed him (with my heart in my mouth); and waited at a little distance for what was to happen next.
she will never get on in her present place; and my advice to her is—leave it.” “Bless your heart alive!
“Might I ask you to give this back to Rosanna, with my love and respects?” says Mrs. Yolland.
With my love and respects—and I can’t find it in my conscience to take a poor girl’s savings, when she may want them herself.” “I can’t find it in _my_ conscience, ma’am, to give the money back,” says Sergeant Cuff.
The latter reflection took me back again to the Sergeant, with a polite intimation that I could not find it in my heart to leave him by himself.
I made a step forward to speak to my mistress—and, feeling my heart fail me (if I must own it), took a step back again, and said nothing.
_My_ heart couldn’t have thumped much harder than it did now, if I had been five-and-twenty again!
Miss Rachel, with all her faults, had been, to my mind, the dearest and prettiest and best young mistress that ever an old servant waited on, and loved.
I left the two together, and went out with a heavy heart.
Just as I approached the swing-door leading into the hall from the servants’ offices, it was violently opened from the other side, and Rosanna Spearman ran by me, with a miserable look of pain in her face, and one of her hands pressed hard over her heart, as if the pang was in that quarter.
He had remembered my telling him that the girl was in love with Mr. Franklin; and he had calculated on _that_, when he appealed to Mr. Franklin’s interest in Rosanna—in Rosanna’s hearing.
She looked cut to the heart on that occasion; and now, as ill-luck would have it, she had been unavoidably stung again, poor soul, on the tender place.
She kissed her mother in a hasty and sudden manner on the cheek.
“And come on down here to me!” I went down to him, choking for breath, with my heart leaping as if it was like to leap out of me.
Asked if she knew what had led her fellow-servant to destroy herself, my daughter answered (as you will foresee) that it was for love of Mr. Franklin Blake.
If Rosanna _has_ died for love of him, it is not with his knowledge or by his fault.
It went to my heart to see how her poor hand trembled—the hand that had loaded her old servant with benefits; the hand that, I pray God, may take mine, when my time comes, and I leave my place for ever!
I kissed it in silence.
You choose a woman, you try her, and she breaks your heart.
The only advice I can offer you is, to give her time.” I handed the letter back, sincerely sorry for Mr. Franklin, for I knew how fond he was of my young lady; and I saw that her mother’s account of her had cut him to the heart.
Mr. Franklin kissed her.
The truth is, I hadn’t the heart to irritate the girl by another of my smart replies.
“I loved her,” the girl said softly.
Penelope’s belief that her fellow-servant had destroyed herself through unrequited love for Mr. Franklin Blake, was confirmed—and that was all.
Read it as I read it, and you will set the right value on the Sergeant’s polite attention in sending me the news of the day: “LAMBETH—Shortly before the closing of the court, Mr. Septimus Luker, the well-known dealer in ancient gems, carvings, intagli, &amp;c., &amp;c., applied to the sitting magistrate for advice.
The magistrate remarked that, if the annoyance were repeated, the applicant could summon the Indians to that court, where they might easily be dealt with under the Act.
It has enabled poor Me to serve the caprice of a wealthy member of the family into which my late uncle married.
I have been cut off from all news of my relatives by marriage for some time past.
A dark conspiracy was on foot in the midst of us; and our beloved and innocent friend had been entangled in its meshes.
I could write pages of affectionate warning on this one theme, but (alas!)
I am dying for more news of him, after his adventure in Northumberland Street.” She kissed her mother on the forehead, and looked my way.
Nothing, compared to the hardness of the unregenerate human heart!
He not only forgot himself so far as to kiss her hand—he adopted a gentleness of tone in answering her which, in such a case, was little better than a compromise with sin.
“Go with our friends, and enjoy yourself.” Her daughter stooped, and kissed her.
I looked with interest at the momentary softening of that obdurate heart.
Permit me to say—my heart bled for her.
For more than two years I have been suffering under an insidious form of heart disease, which, without any symptoms to alarm me, has, by little and little, fatally broken me down.
Here was a beloved relative and perishing fellow-creature, on the eve of the great change, utterly unprepared; and led, providentially led, to reveal her situation to Me!
I took my aunt in my arms—my overflowing tenderness was not to be satisfied, _now_, with anything less than an embrace.
My large experience (as Reader and Visitor, under not less, first and last, than fourteen beloved clerical friends) informed me that this was another case for preparation by books.
I have it on the authority of Lady Verinder herself, that her daughter was ready to marry Franklin Blake, before that infernal Indian Diamond disappeared from the house.
But she had confessed to her mother that she loved cousin Franklin, and her mother had trusted cousin Franklin with the secret.
So there he was, Miss Clack, with his creditors content to wait, and with the certain prospect before him of marrying an heiress.
By all means consider him a scoundrel; but tell me, if you please, why he should steal the Moonstone?” “The human heart is unsearchable,” I said gently.
He first steals the Moonstone (without the slightest reason) through natural depravity; and he then acts a part, in relation to the loss of the jewel, which there is not the slightest necessity to act, and which leads to his mortally offending the young lady who would otherwise have married him.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“My lady’s love, Miss; and I was to say that you would find a letter inside.” Having given that message, the fresh-coloured young footman surprised me by looking as if he would have liked to run away.
All sent their love; and all expressed a cheering belief that Lady Verinder’s indisposition would soon pass away.” “_You_ don’t think it’s serious, do you, Godfrey?” “Far from it!
Successful love may sometimes use the language of flattery, I admit.
But hopeless love, dearest, always speaks the truth.” He drew his chair close, and took her hand, when he said “hopeless love.” There was a momentary silence.
Am I mad to dream of some future day when your heart may soften to me?
I must have _that_ to cherish, and to comfort me, if I have nothing else!” His voice trembled, and he put his white handkerchief to his eyes.
Suppose you were not in love with me?
Suppose you were in love with some other woman?” “Yes?” “Suppose you discovered that woman to be utterly unworthy of you?
Suppose the bare idea of ever marrying such a person made your face burn, only with thinking of it.” “Yes?” “And, suppose, in spite of all that—you couldn’t tear her from your heart?
Suppose the love this wretch had inspired in you?
A woman who can speak the truth, for the truth’s own sake—a woman who will sacrifice her pride, rather than sacrifice an honest man who loves her—is the most priceless of all treasures.
When such a woman marries, if her husband only wins her esteem and regard, he wins enough to ennoble his whole life.
Judge what that place is—when I implore you on my knees, to let the cure of your poor wounded heart be my care.
A heart that loves and honours you; a home whose peaceful claims and happy duties win gently on you day by day—try the consolation, Rachel, which is to be found _there!_ I don’t ask for your love—I will be content with your affection and regard.
The truth is, that women try marriage as a Refuge, far more numerously than they are willing to admit; and, what is more, they find that marriage has justified their confidence in it.
You may marry some other man, some years hence.
Or you may marry the man, dearest, who is now at your feet, and who prizes your respect and admiration above the love of any other woman on the face of the earth.” “Gently, Godfrey!
I tell you again, I am miserable enough and desperate enough, if you say another word, to marry you on your own terms.
Do my father and mother live unhappily together?” “Far from it—so far as I can see.” “When my mother was a girl, Rachel (it is no secret in the family), she had loved as you love—she had given her heart to a man who was unworthy of her.
She married my father, respecting him, admiring him, but nothing more.
They understood each other so thoroughly by this time, that I fully expected to see them walk off together, arm in arm, to be married.
He was appointed guardian by the will, until his niece married, or came of age.
At any rate, in ten days from my aunt’s death, the secret of the marriage-engagement was no secret at all within the circle of the family, and the grand question for Mr. Ablewhite senior—another confirmed castaway!—was how to make himself and his authority most agreeable to the wealthy young lady who was going to marry his son.
The church-bells were going for a week-day service; they suggested a word of affectionate remonstrance on my part.
Now I have lost her, my heart turns for comfort to the people she liked.
We discussed family affairs and future plans—always excepting that one future plan which was to end in her marriage.
This was, of itself, enough to encourage me to take her future conversion in hand—beginning with a few words of earnest warning directed against the hasty formation of the marriage tie, and so getting on to higher things.
I had prepared quite a little Paradise for my beloved Rachel—and here was the Serpent already!
“Tired, love?” I inquired.
I said to Rachel, when we came out, “Has it found its way to your heart, dear?” And she answered, “No; it has only made my head ache.” This might have been discouraging to some people; but, once embarked on a career of manifest usefulness, nothing discourages Me.
It was plainly necessary to rouse her by some reference to those worldly interests which she still had at heart.
“Do you know, love,” I said, “I had an odd fancy, yesterday, about Mr. Bruff?
In my dauntless zeal for her welfare, I ran the great risk, and openly alluded to her marriage engagement.
She checked herself—laid her head back on the pillow—considered a minute—and then answered in these remarkable words: “_I shall never marry Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite._” It was my turn to start at that.
“The marriage is considered by the whole family as a settled thing!” “Mr.
I had reckoned on leading her to higher things by means of a little earnest exhortation on the subject of her marriage.
And now, if she was to be believed, no such event as her marriage was to take place at all.
Supposing Rachel really broke off the marriage, on which the Ablewhites, father and son, counted as a settled thing, what would be the result?
I have an indistinct remembrance that he was very affectionate.
I don’t know why I made a proposal of marriage to Miss Verinder.
She has told me with her own lips (this, dear lady, is between ourselves) that she loves another man, and that her only idea in marrying me is to try and put that other man out of her head.
And it was equally easy to recognise the welcome reappearance of his own finer nature in the horror with which he recoiled from the idea of a marriage with Rachel, and in the charming eagerness which he showed to return to his Ladies and his Poor.
When I answered for a loving reception of him at the Mothers’ Small-Clothes, the grateful heart of our Christian Hero overflowed.
His heart is set on our marriage—there will be great difficulty, I fear, in reconciling him to the breaking-off of the engagement.
It has also reached my ears, that his anxiety to recover his place in my estimation has been attributed in certain quarters, to a mercenary eagerness to make his peace (through me) with a venerable committee-woman at the Mothers’ Small-Clothes, abundantly blessed with the goods of this world, and a beloved and intimate friend of my own.
In less than a month from the time of which I am now writing, events in the money-market (which diminished even _my_ miserable little income) forced me into foreign exile, and left me with nothing but a loving remembrance of Mr. Godfrey which the slander of the world has assailed, and assailed in vain.
I went downstairs to luncheon, naturally anxious to see how Rachel was affected by her release from her marriage engagement.
It appeared to me—but I own I am a poor authority in such matters—that the recovery of her freedom had set her thinking again of that other man whom she loved, and that she was furious with herself for not being able to control a revulsion of feeling of which she was secretly ashamed.
But I knew the importance which his worldly greed attached to his son’s marriage with Miss Verinder—and I felt a positive conviction (do what Mr. Godfrey might to prevent it) that we should see him the next day.
Mr. Ablewhite stood up in the middle of the room, with his bald head much pinker than I had ever seen it yet, and addressed himself in the most affectionate manner to his niece.
“Some weeks ago,” pursued the old gentleman, “my son informed me that Miss Verinder had done him the honour to engage herself to marry him.
“I did engage myself to marry him.” “Very frankly answered!” said Mr. Ablewhite.
If he told you that I proposed breaking off our marriage engagement, and that he agreed on his side—he told you the truth.” The self-registering thermometer at the top of Mr. Ablewhite’s bald head began to indicate a rise of temper.
“I am to understand, then,” he said, “that your marriage engagement is broken off?” “You are to understand that, Mr. Ablewhite, if you please.” “I am also to take it as a matter of fact that the proposal to withdraw from the engagement came, in the first instance, from _you?_” “It came, in the first instance, from me.
Your cursed family pride is insulting Godfrey, as it insulted _me_ when I married your aunt.
Her family—her beggarly family—turned their backs on her for marrying an honest man, who had made his own place and won his own fortune.
I wasn’t good enough for the Herncastles, when _I_ married.
“As an affectionate well-wisher and friend,” I proceeded, “and as one long accustomed to arouse, convince, prepare, enlighten, and fortify others, permit me to take the most pardonable of all liberties—the liberty of composing your mind.” He began to recover himself; he was on the point of breaking out—he _would_ have broken out, with anybody else.
That was Mr. Ablewhite’s revenge on Rachel, for refusing to marry his son!
I hope I shall never see you or your tracts again.” She went back to Rachel and kissed her.
What can I do for you?” Consistently perverse in everything—capricious and unreasonable in all the actions of her life—Rachel melted into tears at those commonplace words, and returned her aunt’s kiss in silence.
Rachel, dearest Rachel, I offer you my modest home; come to London by the next train, love, and share it with me!” Mr. Bruff said nothing.
“Haven’t you seen _yet_, that my heart yearns to make a Christian of you?
You were at the funeral, Mr. Bruff; you saw how everybody loved her; you saw the poor helpless people crying at her grave over the loss of their best friend.
I only wished to say to her, “May your hard heart be softened!
Miss Verinder had her own private reason for breaking her marriage engagement—and I was at the bottom of it.
The true story of the broken marriage engagement comes first in point of time, and must therefore take the first place in the present narrative.
Neither she, nor her husband (if she married), could raise sixpence, either on the property in land, or on the property in money.
Hardly a week had passed since I had heard (to my surprise and distress) of Miss Verinder’s proposed marriage.
I had the sincerest admiration and affection for her; and I had been inexpressibly grieved when I heard that she was about to throw herself away on Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite.
And now, here was the man—whom I had always believed to be a smooth-tongued impostor—justifying the very worst that I had thought of him, and plainly revealing the mercenary object of the marriage, on his side!
If that position was not a desperate one, it would be well worth his while to marry Miss Verinder for her income alone.
In the former event, if I remained silent, I should be conniving at a marriage which would make her miserable for life.
“May I speak to you,” I asked, “about your marriage engagement?” “Yes,” she said, indifferently, “if you have nothing more interesting to talk about.” “Will you forgive an old friend and servant of your family, Miss Rachel, if I venture on asking whether your heart is set on this marriage?” “I am marrying in despair, Mr. Bruff—on the chance of dropping into some sort of stagnant happiness which may reconcile me to my life.” Strong language!
and suggestive of something below the surface, in the shape of a romance.
“_His_ heart must be set on the marriage at any rate?” “He says so, and I suppose I ought to believe him.
He would hardly marry me, after what I have owned to him, unless he was fond of me.” Poor thing!
the bare idea of a man marrying her for his own selfish and mercenary ends had never entered her head.
If you hear any rumours of my marriage when you get back to London contradict them at once, on my authority.” “Have you resolved to break your engagement?” I asked.
But this was the first occasion on which I had ever found myself advising a young lady how to obtain her release from a marriage engagement.
She was then to add that their marriage, after what she had discovered, was a simple impossibility—and she was to put it to him, whether he thought it wisest to secure her silence by falling in with her views, or to force her, by opposing them, to make the motive under which she was acting generally known.
I have promised to marry that man.
“He has been intimate enough with me to ask me to be his wife.
If I am told that this is a mere speculation, I ask, in my turn, what other theory will account for his giving up a marriage which would have maintained him in splendour for the rest of his life?
In justification of the highly unprofessional sacrifice to mere curiosity which I thus made, permit me to remind anybody who may read these lines, that no living person (in England, at any rate) can claim to have had such an intimate connexion with the romance of the Indian Diamond as mine has been.
“The clairvoyance in this case is simply a development of the romantic side of the Indian character.
It was all written in one paragraph, without any attempt at punctuation, thus: “To the three Indian men living with the lady called Macann at Frizinghall in Yorkshire.” The Hindoo characters followed; and the English translation appeared at the end, expressed in these mysterious words: “In the name of the Regent of the Night, whose seat is on the Antelope, whose arms embrace the four corners of the earth.
But, barring this drawback, I am bound to own that he has stated no more than the truth in representing me as wounded to the heart by Rachel’s treatment, and as leaving England in the first keenness of suffering caused by the bitterest disappointment of my life.
Mr. Bruff did not, at that time, feel himself at liberty to inform me of the motives which had privately influenced Rachel and Godfrey Ablewhite in recalling the marriage promise, on either side.
It was relief enough to me, after the jealous disappointment caused by hearing that she had ever contemplated being Godfrey’s wife, to know that reflection had convinced her of acting rashly, and that she had effected her own release from her marriage engagement.
The late Mrs. Betteredge took her exercise on that favourite female animal whenever I happened to deny her anything that she had set her heart on.
So sure as I came home from my work on these occasions, so sure was my wife to call to me up the kitchen stairs, and to say that, after my brutal treatment of her, she hadn’t the heart to cook me my dinner.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I love you.” The letter dropped from my hand.
I tell you plainly, I can’t find it in my heart to distress you, after what you have had to bear already.
I did these strange things, because I loved you.
You were like a lover in a dream.
I believe I found out you were in love with her, before you knew it yourself.
I was mad enough to love you; and I couldn’t even attract your notice.
I used to kiss the pillow on which your head had rested all night.
And, God help us all!” he added, in a lower tone, “it’s no less natural in _her_.” I proceed to copy the continuation of the letter from the original, in my own possession:— “Having determined to keep the nightgown, and to see what use my love, or my revenge (I hardly know which) could turn it to in the future, the next thing to discover was how to keep it without the risk of being found out.
if you have ever loved, you will understand how it was that all my courage cooled, when I walked into the room, and found myself in your presence.
Was such a little thing as the keeping of the nightgown likely to weigh on my spirits, and to set my heart sinking within me, at the time when I ought to have spoken to you?
Behind your back, I loved you with all my heart and soul.
I might find myself taken off, at a moment’s notice, to the police court at Frizinghall, to be charged on suspicion, and searched accordingly.
If these two together don’t harden my heart against the coldness which has hitherto frozen it up (I mean the coldness of your treatment of me), there will be the end of my efforts—and the end of my life.
“I beg to remain, sir, your true lover and humble servant, “ROSANNA SPEARMAN.” The reading of the letter was completed by Betteredge in silence.
I had sent her away from me, wounded to the heart!
I don’t stop to ask who took the Moonstone (as a means to her end, Rosanna Spearman would have taken fifty Moonstones)—I only say that the disappearance of the jewel gave this reclaimed thief who was in love with you, an opportunity of setting you and Rachel at variance for the rest of your lives.
And when you had read the letter, you pitied the poor creature, and couldn’t find it in your heart to suspect her.
She took her own romantic, high-flown view of the matter.
But I do trust in Rachel’s still preserving, in some remote little corner of her heart, a certain perverse weakness for _you_.
I saw nothing but the woman I loved coming nearer and nearer to me.
I could resist it no longer—I caught her in my arms, and covered her face with kisses.
There was a moment when I thought the kisses were returned; a moment when it seemed as if she, too might have forgotten.
It seems a cowardly surprise, to surprise me into letting you kiss me.
And have you heart enough left to feel ashamed of your errand?
All I could say was, “Rachel, you once loved me.” She shuddered, and looked away from me.
Something in the tone, even more than in the words, went straight to my heart.
I spare him, when my heart is breaking; I screen him when my own character is at stake; and _he_—of all human beings, _he_—turns on me now, and tells me that I ought to have explained myself!
After believing in him as I did, after loving him as I did, after thinking of him by day, and dreaming of him by night—he wonders I didn’t charge him with his disgrace the first time we met: ‘My heart’s darling, you are a Thief!
My hero whom I love and honour, you have crept into my room under cover of the night, and stolen my Diamond!’ That is what I ought to have said.
Or you shall stoop to the lowest infamy of all, and force your way out.” It wrung my heart to see her; it wrung my heart to hear her.
And I hoped—with all my heart and soul I hoped!—that you would take the opportunity, and put the Diamond back secretly in the drawer.” I attempted to speak.
But even then—even when I was maddened by the searching and questioning of the policeman, whom _you_ had sent in—even then, there was some infatuation in my mind which wouldn’t let me give you up.
Now you are a rich man, now you have got a place in the world, now you may marry the best lady in the land—are you afraid I shall say the words which I have never said yet to anybody but you?
“I can’t tear you out of my heart,” she said, “even now!
“And even then, I doubt if a girl of any delicacy, whose heart had been set on marrying you, could have brought herself to charge you to your face with being a thief.
His suit had prospered, and his marriage had been considered as a settled and certain thing.
“I was in Yorkshire, the other day, and I am in Yorkshire again now, on rather a romantic errand,” I said.
At another, the one beloved face which I shall never see again, rose at my bedside, hideously phosphorescent in the black darkness, and glared and grinned at me.
What is the secret of the attraction that there is for me in this man?
It is plain that she has loved him, throughout the estrangement between them.
In more than one place the rapture of discovering that he has deserved to be loved, breaks its way innocently through the stoutest formalities of pen and ink, and even defies the stronger restraint still of writing to a stranger.
My own happiness has been trampled under foot; my own love has been torn from me.
Shall I live to see a happiness of others, which is of my making—a love renewed, which is of my bringing back?
And yet, knowing this, I cannot find it in my heart to disappoint her.
I won’t disappoint Miss Verinder; and I won’t delay a reconciliation between two young people who love each other, and who have been parted too long already.
The misery of many years has not hardened my heart, thank God.
How can I be ungrateful enough to have any concealment from _you?_ I love him,” she said simply, “I have loved him from first to last—even when I was wronging him in my own thoughts; even when I was saying the hardest and the cruellest words to him.
After adding the water as I had directed, Miss Verinder seized a moment—while Betteredge was locking the chest, and while Mr. Bruff was looking back to his papers—and slyly kissed the rim of the medicine glass.
“It was safe in the bank.” My heart throbbed fast; the pulses at my temples beat furiously.
I thought of my own youth; I thought of the gentle eyes which had once looked love at _me_.
In the heaviness of my heart I turned to my Journal for relief, and wrote in it what is written here.
One of us absorbed in his writing; the other absorbed in her love.
Miss Verinder is to return to Yorkshire in the autumn (for her marriage, no doubt); and I am to take a holiday, and be a guest in the house.
A few hours afterwards, Mr. Godfrey (as you yourself have told me) made a proposal of marriage to Miss Verinder.
He proposed marriage to her for the second time—and (after having being accepted) he consented, at her request, to consider the marriage as broken off.
But you will say, he might have saved the three thousand pounds, to redeem the pledged Diamond, if he had married.
He might have done so certainly—supposing neither his wife, nor her guardians and trustees, objected to his anticipating more than half of the income at his disposal, for some unknown purpose, in the first year of his marriage.
The lady at the Villa, had heard of his contemplated marriage.
He couldn’t marry—he really couldn’t marry, under all the circumstances.
How he tried his luck again with another lady, and how _that_ marriage also broke down on the question of money, you know already.
He whispered, “It’s coming!” Then he said, “Kiss me!” I kissed his forehead.
It is reported here, that you and Miss Verinder are to be married next month.
The fact to which I allude is—the marriage of Miss Rachel and Mr. Franklin Blake.
And the married couple went to spend the honeymoon in Scotland.
It was at page three hundred and eighteen—a domestic bit concerning Robinson Crusoe’s marriage, as follows: “With those Thoughts, I considered my new Engagement, that I had a Wife”—(Observe!
I scored the bit about the Child with my pencil, and put a morsel of paper for a mark to keep the place; “Lie you there,” I said, “till the marriage of Mr. Franklin and Miss Rachel is some months older—and then we’ll see!” The months passed (more than I had bargained for), and no occasion presented itself for disturbing that mark in the book.

What with the heat, and what with the vexation of the weather, neither officers nor men seemed to be in heart for their duty while the calm lasted.
Finding myself, for the second time, in these romantic regions, I resolved not to leave Kattiawar, without looking once more on the magnificent desolation of Somnauth.

But the almost general voice of the times attached the most foul suspicions to the death of the unfortunate Countess, more especially as it took place so very opportunely for the indulgence of her lover&#39;s ambition.
In the following extract of the passage, the reader will find the authority I had for the story of the romance:-- “At the west end of the church are the ruins of a manor, anciently belonging (as a cell, or place of removal, as some report) to the monks of Abington.
This, it seems, was proved by the report of Dr. Walter Bayly, sometime fellow of New College, then living in Oxford, and professor of physic in that university; whom, because he would not consent to take away her life by poison, the Earl endeavoured to displace him the court.
Neither are these following passages to be forgotten, that as soon as ever she was murdered, they made great haste to bury her before the coroner had given in his inquest (which the Earl himself condemned as not done advisedly), which her father, or Sir John Robertsett (as I suppose), hearing of, came with all speed hither, caused her corpse to be taken up, the coroner to sit upon her, and further inquiry to be made concerning this business to the full; but it was generally thought that the Earl stopped his mouth, and made up the business betwixt them; and the good Earl, to make plain to the world the great love he bare to her while alive, and what a grief the loss of so virtuous a lady was to his tender heart, caused (though the thing, by these and other means, was beaten into the heads of the principal men of the University of Oxford) her body to be reburied in St, Mary&#39;s Church in Oxford, with great pomp and solemnity.
The tradition as to Leicester&#39;s death was thus communicated by Ben Jonson to Drummond of Hawthornden:--“The Earl of Leicester gave a bottle of liquor to his Lady, which he willed her to use in any faintness, which she, after his returne from court, not knowing it was poison, gave him, and so he died.”--BEN JONSON&#39;S INFORMATION TO DRUMMOND OF HAWTHORNDEN, MS., SIR ROBERT SIBBALD&#39;S COPY.]
“Leicester,” she cried, “is this thy love That thou so oft hast sworn to me, To leave me in this lonely grove, Immured in shameful privity?
“No more thou com&#39;st with lover&#39;s speed, Thy once beloved bride to see; But be she alive, or be she dead, I fear, stern Earl, &#39;s the same to thee.
“If that my beauty is but small, Among court ladies all despised, Why didst thou rend it from that hall, Where, scornful Earl, it well was prized?
“For know, when sick&#39;ning grief doth prey, And tender love&#39;s repaid with scorn, The sweetest beauty will decay,-- What floweret can endure the storm?
“At court, I&#39;m told, is beauty&#39;s throne, Where every lady&#39;s passing rare, That Eastern flowers, that shame the sun, Are not so glowing, not so fair.
Daily to pine and waste with care!
“Beshrew my heart else,” answered the tapster, “since there are but four miles betwixt us and Oxford.
with all my heart, my good host,” said the stranger; “let it be a quart of your best Canaries, and give me your good help to drink it.” “Nay, you are but in your accidence yet, Sir Traveller, if you call on your host for help for such a sipping matter as a quart of sack; Were it a gallon, you might lack some neighbouring aid at my hand, and yet call yourself a toper.” “Fear me not.” said the guest, “I will do my devoir as becomes a man who finds himself within five miles of Oxford; for I am not come from the field of Mars to discredit myself amongst the followers of Minerva.” As he spoke thus, the landlord, with much semblance of hearty welcome, ushered his guest into a large, low chamber, where several persons were seated together in different parties--some drinking, some playing at cards, some conversing, and some, whose business called them to be early risers on the morrow, concluding their evening meal, and conferring with the chamberlain about their night&#39;s quarters.
Were it so, I should say”--(taking another cup of sack)--“Here&#39;s God rest him, with all my heart.” “Tush, man,” replied the traveller, “never fear but you will have credit by your nephew yet, especially if he be the Michael Lambourne whom I knew, and loved very nearly, or altogether, as well as myself.
I will drink a round with your guests with all my heart, rather than be termed a mar-feast.” So saying, he arose and joined the company, who, encouraged by the precept and example of Michael Lambourne, and consisting chiefly of persons much disposed to profit by the opportunity of a merry meal at the expense of their landlord, had already made some inroads upon the limits of temperance, as was evident from the tone in which Michael inquired after his old acquaintances in the town, and the bursts of laughter with which each answer was received.
For when the sun hath left the west, He chooses the tree that he loves the best, And he whoops out his song, and he laughs at his jest; Then, though hours be late and weather foul, We&#39;ll drink to the health of the bonny, bonny owl.
And so Swashing Will of Wallingford hath bid us good-night?” “He died the death of a fat buck,” said one of the party, “being shot with a crossbow bolt, by old Thatcham, the Duke&#39;s stout park-keeper at Donnington Castle.” “Ay, ay, he always loved venison well,” replied Michael, “and a cup of claret to boot--and so here&#39;s one to his memory.
“Pranced off--made immortal ten years since,” said the mercer; “marry, sir, Oxford Castle and Goodman Thong, and a tenpenny-worth of cord, best know how.” “What, so they hung poor Prance high and dry?
so much for loving to walk by moonlight.
“Why, him they called Tony Fire-the-Fagot, because he brought a light to kindle the pile round Latimer and Ridley, when the wind blew out Jack Thong&#39;s torch, and no man else would give him light for love or money.” “Tony Foster lives and thrives,” said the host.
But since that, Tony married a pure precisian, and is as good a Protestant, I warrant you, as the best.” “And looks grave, and holds his head high, and scorns his old companions,” said the mercer.
And there he dwells, and has as little to do with any poor wight in Cumnor, as if he were himself a belted knight.” “Nay,” said the mercer, “it is not altogether pride in Tony neither; there is a fair lady in the case, and Tony will scarce let the light of day look on her.” “How!” said Tressilian, who now for the first time interfered in their conversation; “did ye not say this Foster was married, and to a precisian?” “Married he was, and to as bitter a precisian as ever ate flesh in Lent; and a cat-and-dog life she led with Tony, as men said.
I cannot, for my heart, conceive the pleasure of noise, and nonsense, and drunken freaks, and drunken quarrels, and smut, and blasphemy, and so forth, when a man loses money instead of gaining by it.
Know thy friends and kindred, Cicely, and come hither, child, that I may kiss thee, and give thee my blessing.” “Concern not yourself about Cicely, kinsman,” said Giles Gosling, “but e&#39;en let her go her way, a&#39; God&#39;s name; for although your mother were her father&#39;s sister, yet that shall not make you and her cater-cousins.” “Why, uncle,” replied Lambourne, “think&#39;st thou I am an infidel, and would harm those of mine own house?” “It is for no harm that I speak, Mike,” answered his uncle, “but a simple humour of precaution which I have.
But what I liked worst of Tony was, that he loved to take his pleasure by himself, and grudged, as men say, every drop of water that went past his own mill.
Let us once obtain entrance, and all will go well enough.” In a short time the servant returned, and drawing with a careful hand both bolt and bar, opened the gate, which admitted them through an archway into a square court, surrounded by buildings.
He held forth on the matter three Sabbaths past, and illustrated the same by the conduct of an honourable person present, meaning me.” “I prithee peace, Foster,” said Lambourne, “for I know not how it is, I have a sort of creeping comes over my skin when I hear the devil quote Scripture; and besides, man, how couldst thou have the heart to quit that convenient old religion, which you could slip off or on as easily as your glove?
How sayest thou--shall we hunt in couples?” “It is a currish proposal--thus to thrust thyself upon my private matters,” replied Foster; “but thou wert ever an ill-nurtured whelp.” “You shall have no cause to say so, unless you spurn my courtesy,” said Michael Lambourne; “but if so, keep thee well from me, Sir Knight, as the romance has it.
He must ruffle it in another sort that would walk to court in a nobleman&#39;s train.” “Oh, content you, sir,” replied Foster, “there is a change since you knew the English world; and there are those who can hold their way through the boldest courses, and the most secret, and yet never a swaggering word, or an oath, or a profane word in their conversation.” “That is to say,” replied Lambourne, “they are in a trading copartnery, to do the devil&#39;s business without mentioning his name in the firm?
“These are the associates, Amy”--it was thus he communed with himself--“to which thy cruel levity--thine unthinking and most unmerited falsehood, has condemned him of whom his friends once hoped far other things, and who now scorns himself, as he will be scorned by others, for the baseness he stoops to for the love of thee!
But I will not leave the pursuit of thee, once the object of my purest and most devoted affection, though to me thou canst henceforth be nothing but a thing to weep over.
You are arraigned of treason to true love and fond affection, and you must stand up at the bar and answer it with face uncovered--how say you, guilty or not?” “Alas, Amy!” said Tressilian, in a low and melancholy tone, as he suffered her to draw the mantle from his face.
I robbed you of a childish heart, which was not worthy of you, and I can repay the loss with honours and advancement.” “Do you say this to me, Amy?--do you offer me pageants of idle ambition, for the quiet peace you have robbed me of!--But be it so I came not to upbraid, but to serve and to free you.
Otherwise your kind heart--for it was once a kind heart--would have been already at your father&#39;s bedside.--Come, poor, deceived, unhappy maiden!--all shall be forgot--all shall be forgiven.
But come--your father yet lives--come, and one word of affection, one tear of penitence, will efface the memory of all that has passed.” “Have I not already said, Tressilian,” replied she, “that I will surely come to my father, and that without further delay than is necessary to discharge other and equally binding duties?--Go, carry him the news; I come as sure as there is light in heaven--that is, when I obtain permission.” “Permission!--permission to visit your father on his sick-bed, perhaps on his death-bed!” repeated Tressilian, impatiently; “and permission from whom?
I promise you, it requires a good heart to live so near it.
And now see what thanks I get for disgracing myself by converse with him!” “And did he,” said Varney, “being such a fellow as thyself, only lacking, I suppose, thy present humour of hypocrisy, which lies as thin over thy hard, ruffianly heart as gold lacquer upon rusty iron--did he, I say, bring the saintly, sighing Tressilian in his train?” “They came together, by Heaven!” said Foster; “and Tressilian--to speak Heaven&#39;s truth--obtained a moment&#39;s interview with our pretty moppet, while I was talking apart with Lambourne.” “Improvident villain!
“She has of late been casting many a backward look to her father&#39;s halls, whenever her lordly lover leaves her alone.
“You keep a stout heart, Master Varney.
And, in the meantime, hast thou arranged all the matters which were sent from London, and put the western chambers into such fashion as may answer my lord&#39;s humour?” “They may serve a king on his bridal-day,” said Anthony; “and I promise you that Dame Amy sits in them yonder as proud and gay as if she were the Queen of Sheba.” “&#39;Tis the better, good Anthony,” answered Varney; “we must found our future fortunes on her good liking.” “We build on sand then,” said Anthony Foster; “for supposing that she sails away to court in all her lord&#39;s dignity and authority, how is she to look back upon me, who am her jailor as it were, to detain her here against her will, keeping her a caterpillar on an old wall, when she would fain be a painted butterfly in a court garden?” “Fear not her displeasure, man,” said Varney.
To me she is bound by all the ties which can secure her to one who has been the means of gratifying both her love and ambition.
It was I, in short, Dick Varney, who pulled this pretty little daisy from its lowly nook, and placed it in the proudest bonnet in Britain.” “Ay, Master Varney,” said Foster; “but it may be she thinks that had the matter remained with you, the flower had been stuck so slightly into the cap, that the first breath of a changeable breeze of passion had blown the poor daisy to the common.” “She should consider,” said Varney, smiling, “the true faith I owed my lord and master prevented me at first from counselling marriage; and yet I did counsel marriage when I saw she would not be satisfied without the--the sacrament, or the ceremony--which callest thou it, Anthony?” “Still she has you at feud on another score,” said Foster; “and I tell it you that you may look to yourself in time.
In a word, she ascribes the secrecy and obscurity in which she is kept to your secret counsel to my lord, and to my strict agency; and so she loves us both as a sentenced man loves his judge and his jailor.” “She must love us better ere she leave this place, Anthony,” answered Varney.
She loves me not--I would it were as true that I loved not her!
My lord&#39;s interest--and so far it is mine own, for if he sinks I fall in his train--demands concealment of this obscure marriage; and besides, I will not lend her my arm to climb to her chair of state, that she may set her foot on my neck when she is fairly seated.
I must work an interest in her, either through love or through fear; and who knows but I may yet reap the sweetest and best revenge for her former scorn?--that were indeed a masterpiece of courtlike art!
Let me but once be her counsel-keeper--let her confide to me a secret, did it but concern the robbery of a linnet&#39;s nest, and, fair Countess, thou art mine own!” He again paced the room in silence, stopped, filled and drank a cup of wine, as if to compose the agitation of his mind, and muttering, “Now for a close heart and an open and unruffled brow,” he left the apartment.
The curtains were of blue velvet, lined with crimson silk, deeply festooned with gold, and embroidered with the loves of Cupid and Psyche.
And when she first examined and occupied these splendid rooms, it was with the wild and unrestrained joy of a rustic beauty who finds herself suddenly invested with a splendour which her most extravagant wishes had never imagined, and at the same time with the keen feeling of an affectionate heart, which knows that all the enchantment that surrounds her is the work of the great magician Love.
The Countess Amy, therefore--for to that rank she was exalted by her private but solemn union with England&#39;s proudest Earl--had for a time flitted hastily from room to room, admiring each new proof of her lover and her bridegroom&#39;s taste, and feeling that admiration enhanced as she recollected that all she gazed upon was one continued proof of his ardent and devoted affection.
how much more delightful to think that all these fair things have been assembled by his love, for the love of me!
and that this evening--this very evening, which grows darker every instant, I shall thank him more for the love that has created such an unimaginable paradise, than for all the wonders it contains.” “The Lord is to be thanked first,” said the pretty Puritan, “who gave thee, lady, the kind and courteous husband whose love has done so much for thee.
“Know that there are causes of trembling which have nothing to do with fear.--But, Janet,” she added, immediately relapsing into the good-natured and familiar tone which was natural to her, “believe me, I will do what credit I can to your father, and the rather that you, sweetheart, are his child.
alas!” she added, a sudden sadness passing over her fine features, and her eyes filling with tears, “I ought the rather to hold sympathy with thy kind heart, that my own poor father is uncertain of my fate, and they say lies sick and sorrowful for my worthless sake!
I cherish resentment against neither; and though I may have some room to be displeased with both, it shall be their own fault if ever a complaint against them reaches the Earl through my means.
He is the freest, the most open, the most gentle heart that breathes.
For this my father loved him; for this I would have loved him--if I could.
And yet in this case he had what seemed to him, unknowing alike of my marriage and to whom I was united, such powerful reasons to withdraw me from this place, that I well trust he exaggerated much of my father&#39;s indisposition, and that thy better news may be the truer.” “Believe me they are, madam,” answered Varney.
But you must think lower of my head and heart than is due to one whom my noble lord deigns to call his friend, if you suppose I could wilfully and unnecessarily palm upon your ladyship a falsehood, so soon to be detected, in a matter which concerns your happiness.” “Master Varney,” said the Countess, “I know that my lord esteems you, and holds you a faithful and a good pilot in those seas in which he has spread so high and so venturous a sail.
A court-dame--take the most noble, the most virtuous, the most unimpeachable that stands around our Queen&#39;s throne--would, for example, have shunned to speak the truth, or what she thought such, in praise of a discarded suitor, before the dependant and confidant of her noble husband.” “And wherefore,” said the Countess, colouring impatiently, “should I not do justice to Tressilian&#39;s worth, before my husband&#39;s friend--before my husband himself--before the whole world?” “And with the same openness,” said Varney, “your ladyship will this night tell my noble lord your husband that Tressilian has discovered your place of residence, so anxiously concealed from the world, and that he has had an interview with you?” “Unquestionably,” said the Countess.
“My lord&#39;s pleasure,” answered the Countess; “and I am bound to seek no other motive.” “His pleasure it is indeed,” said Varney; “and his pleasure arises out of a love worthy of the object which inspires it.
“It is,” replied the lady, “to speak the truth to my lord at all times--to hold up my mind and my thoughts before him as pure as that polished mirror--so that when he looks into my heart, he shall only see his own features reflected there.” “I am mute, madam,” answered Varney; “and as I have no reason to grieve for Tressilian, who would have my heart&#39;s blood were he able, I shall reconcile myself easily to what may befall the gentleman in consequence of your frank disclosure of his having presumed to intrude upon your solitude.
I will tell the whole matter to my lord; and with such pleading for Tressilian&#39;s folly, as shall dispose my lord&#39;s generous heart rather to serve than to punish him.” “Your judgment, madam,” said Varney, “is far superior to mine, especially as you may, if you will, prove the ice before you step on it, by mentioning Tressilian&#39;s name to my lord, and observing how he endures it.
There was some little displeasure and confusion on the Countess&#39;s brow, owing to her struggle with Varney&#39;s pertinacity; but it was exchanged for an expression of the purest joy and affection, as she threw herself into the arms of the noble stranger who entered, and clasping him to her bosom, exclaimed, “At length--at length thou art come!” Varney discreetly withdrew as his lord entered, and Janet was about to do the same, when her mistress signed to her to remain.
Meanwhile the Earl, for he was of no inferior rank, returned his lady&#39;s caress with the most affectionate ardour, but affected to resist when she strove to take his cloak from him.
Do not think Amy can love thee better in this glorious garb than she did when she gave her heart to him who wore the russet-brown cloak in the woods of Devon.” “And thou too,” said the Earl, as gracefully and majestically he led his beautiful Countess towards the chair of state which was prepared for them both--“thou too, my love, hast donned a dress which becomes thy rank, though it cannot improve thy beauty.
What think&#39;st thou of our court taste?” The lady cast a sidelong glance upon the great mirror as they passed it by, and then said, “I know not how it is, but I think not of my own person while I look at the reflection of thine.
Sit thou there,” she said, as they approached the chair of state, “like a thing for men to worship and to wonder at.” “Ay, love,” said the Earl, “if thou wilt share my state with me.” “Not so,” said the Countess; “I will sit on this footstool at thy feet, that I may spell over thy splendour, and learn, for the first time, how princes are attired.” And with a childish wonder, which her youth and rustic education rendered not only excusable but becoming, mixed as it was with a delicate show of the most tender conjugal affection, she examined and admired from head to foot the noble form and princely attire of him who formed the proudest ornament of the court of England&#39;s Maiden Queen, renowned as it was for splendid courtiers, as well as for wise counsellors.
Bethink you of the most unhappy Queen Mary&#39;s days, when this same Philip held sway with her in England, and of the piles which were built for our noblest, and our wisest, and our most truly sanctified prelates and divines--and will you, whom men call the standard-bearer of the true Protestant faith, be contented to wear the emblem and mark of such a Romish tyrant as he of Spain?” “Oh, content you, my love,” answered the Earl; “we who spread our sails to gales of court favour cannot always display the ensigns we love the best, or at all times refuse sailing under colours which we like not.
“And this other collar, to what country does this fair jewel belong?” “To a very poor one, my love,” replied the Earl; “this is the Order of Saint Andrew, revived by the last James of Scotland.
But shall not your wife, my love--at least one day soon--be surrounded with the honour which arises neither from the toils of the mechanic who decks her apartment, nor from the silks and jewels with which your generosity adorns her, but which is attached to her place among the matronage, as the avowed wife of England&#39;s noblest Earl?” “One day?” said her husband.
“Yes, Amy, my love, one day this shall surely happen; and, believe me, thou canst not wish for that day more fondly than I.
But, Amy, this cannot yet be; and these dear but stolen interviews are all I can give to the loveliest and the best beloved of her sex.” “But WHY can it not be?” urged the Countess, in the softest tones of persuasion--“why can it not immediately take place--this more perfect, this uninterrupted union, for which you say you wish, and which the laws of God and man alike command?
We that toil in courts are like those who climb a mountain of loose sand--we dare make no halt until some projecting rock affords us a secure footing and resting-place.
To declare my marriage were to be the artificer of my own ruin.
“Let both be for to-morrow, my love,” replied the Earl.
“I see they open the folding-doors into the banqueting-parlour, and as I have ridden far and fast, a cup of wine will not be unacceptable.” So saying he led his lovely wife into the next apartment, where Varney and Foster received them with the deepest reverences, which the first paid after the fashion of the court, and the second after that of the congregation.
How thinkest thou, Varney?” “Faith, my good lord,” said his attendant, “I think fetters of gold are like no other fetters--they are ever the weightier the welcomer.” “For all that, Varney,” replied his master, “I am well-nigh resolved they shall bind me to the court no longer.
It will not be Richard Varney who will incur the displeasure of majesty, and the ridicule of the court, when the stateliest fabric that ever was founded upon a prince&#39;s favour melts away like a morning frost-work.
You have retired, we will say, to some one of your most distant castles, so far from court that you hear neither the sorrow of your friends nor the glee of your enemies, We will suppose, too, that your successful rival will be satisfied (a thing greatly to be doubted) with abridging and cutting away the branches of the great tree which so long kept the sun from him, and that he does not insist upon tearing you up by the roots.
I impose a restraint on my own poor heart, and wound one yet more dear to me; but the patriot must subdue the husband.” Having said this in a melancholy but firm accent, he left the dressing apartment.
“Now, God be with thee, my dearest and loveliest!” said the Earl, scarce tearing himself from her embrace, yet again returning to fold her again and again in his arms, and again bidding farewell, and again returning to kiss and bid adieu once more.
did ever lady, with bare foot in slipper, seek boon of a brave knight, yet return with denial?” “Anything, Amy, anything thou canst ask I will grant,” answered the Earl--“always excepting,” he said, “that which might ruin us both.” “Nay,” said the Countess, “I urge not my wish to be acknowledged in the character which would make me the envy of England--as the wife, that is, of my brave and noble lord, the first as the most fondly beloved of English nobles.
and has he not told you that the good old knight was following, with good heart and health, his favourite and wonted exercise.
He stands high in the opinion of this Radcliffe, this Sussex, against whom I am barely able to maintain my ground in the opinion of our suspicious mistress; and if he had me at such advantage, Amy, as to become acquainted with the tale of our marriage, before Elizabeth were fitly prepared, I were an outcast from her grace for ever--a bankrupt at once in favour and in fortune, perhaps, for she hath in her a touch of her father Henry--a victim, and it may be a bloody one, to her offended and jealous resentment.” “But why, my lord,” again urged his lady, “should you deem thus injuriously of a man of whom you know so little?
“You are ill, my love,” said the Earl, supporting her in his arms.
Have you aught else, involving less than my fame, my fortune, and my life, to ask of me?” “Nothing, my lord and love,” answered the Countess faintly; “something there was that I would have told you, but your anger has driven it from my recollection.” “Reserve it till our next meeting, my love,” said the Earl fondly, and again embracing her; “and barring only those requests which I cannot and dare not grant, thy wish must be more than England and all its dependencies can fulfil, if it is not gratified to the letter.” Thus saying, he at length took farewell.
Foster scowled at an interference which seemed intended to prevent his paying his court to his patron, but gave place to Varney; and the Earl, mounting without further observation, and forgetting that his assumed character of a domestic threw him into the rear of his supposed master, rode pensively out of the quadrangle, not without waving his hand repeatedly in answer to the signals which were made by the Countess with her kerchief from the windows of her apartment.
Our lord is returning to court in an evil humour for us.” “How meanest thou?” said Foster.
He has purchased her at a monarch&#39;s ransom, and I warrant me he rues his bargain.” “Not a whit, Tony,” answered the master of the horse; “he dotes on her, and will forsake the court for her.
“Have you,” said he, “ever been at court?” “No,” replied Lambourne; “but ever since I was ten years old, I have dreamt once a week that I was there, and made my fortune.” “It may be your own fault if your dream comes not true,” said Varney.
“Are you needy?” “Um!” replied Lambourne; “I love pleasure.” “That is a sufficient answer, and an honest one,” said Varney.
“When I was a youth, I had some few whimsies; but I rubbed them partly out of my recollection on the rough grindstone of the wars, and what remained I washed out in the broad waves of the Atlantic.” “Thou hast served, then, in the Indies?” “In both East and West,” answered the candidate for court service, “by both sea and land.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“You are contented, then,” said Varney to his companion, “to take court service?” “Ay, worshipful sir, if you like my terms as well as I like yours.” “And what are your terms?” demanded Varney.
All paid court to Varney, with more or less deference, as suited their own rank, or the urgency of the business which brought them to his lord&#39;s levee.
“Now the Lord love his noble countenance!” said the bailiff, who had thrust himself into the presence-chamber; “he looks somewhat pale.
The Earl and his retinue took horse soon after to return to court, accompanied by the shouts of the inhabitants of Woodstock, who made the old oaks ring with re-echoing, “Long live Queen Elizabeth, and the noble Earl of Leicester!” The urbanity and courtesy of the Earl even threw a gleam of popularity over his attendants, as their haughty deportment had formerly obscured that of their master; and men shouted, “Long life to the Earl, and to his gallant followers!” as Varney and Lambourne, each in his rank, rode proudly through the streets of Woodstock.
Anthony Foster is a dangerous man, defended by strong court patronage, which hath borne him out in matters of very deep concernment.
When an old song comes across us merry old knights of the spigot, it runs away with our discretion.” “Well, mine host, my grandfather, like some other Cornishmen, kept a warm affection to the House of York, and espoused the quarrel of this Simnel, assuming the title of Earl of Warwick, as the county afterwards, in great numbers, countenanced the cause of Perkin Warbeck, calling himself the Duke of York.
The good knight did what he might to mitigate the distresses of my ancestor; and their friendship became so strict, that my father was bred up as the sworn brother and intimate of the present Sir Hugh Robsart, the only son of Sir Roger, and the heir of his honest, and generous, and hospitable temper, though not equal to him in martial achievements.” “I have heard of good Sir Hugh Robsart,” interrupted the host, “many a time and oft; his huntsman and sworn servant, Will Badger, hath spoken of him an hundred times in this very house.
A jovial knight he is, and hath loved hospitality and open housekeeping more than the present fashion, which lays as much gold lace on the seams of a doublet as would feed a dozen of tall fellows with beef and ale for a twelvemonth, and let them have their evening at the alehouse once a week, to do good to the publican.” “If you have seen Will Badger, mine host,” said Tressilian, “you have heard enough of Sir Hugh Robsart; and therefore I will but say, that the hospitality you boast of hath proved somewhat detrimental to the estate of his family, which is perhaps of the less consequence, as he has but one daughter to whom to bequeath it.
There was a time, however, at which I felt the kind knight&#39;s excessive love for field-sports detained me from studies, by which I might have profited more; but I ceased to regret the leisure which gratitude and hereditary friendship compelled me to bestow on these rural avocations.
The exquisite beauty of Mistress Amy Robsart, as she grew up from childhood to woman, could not escape one whom circumstances obliged to be so constantly in her company--I loved her, in short, mine host, and her father saw it.” “And crossed your true loves, no doubt?” said mine host.
There was a contract of future marriage executed betwixt us, upon her father&#39;s intercession; but to comply with her anxious request, the execution was deferred for a twelvemonth.
Many circumstances, which I noticed but little at the time--for I deemed her heart as open as her angelic countenance--have since arisen on my memory, to convince me of their private understanding.
The lady, if I understand you, has already rejected your interference in the matter.” “It is but too true,” said Tressilian; “I cannot deny it.” “Then, marry, by what right or interest do you process a compulsory interference with her inclination, disgraceful as it may be to herself and to her parents?
Unless my judgment gulls me, those under whose protection she has thrown herself would have small hesitation to reject your interference, even if it were that of a father or brother; but as a discarded lover, you expose yourself to be repelled with the strong hand, as well as with scorn.
He courts the severe and strict sect of Puritans.
Her Majesty is strict in such matters, and (if it be not treason to speak it) will rather, it is said, pardon a dozen courtiers for falling in love with herself, than one for giving preference to another woman.
No man must know when or how you departed.” By the aid of his dark lantern he conducted Tressilian, as soon as he had made himself ready for his journey, through a long intricacy of passages, which opened to an outer court, and from thence to a remote stable, where he had already placed his guest&#39;s horse.
“Hence,” said he, “the schoolmaster is termed, classically, LUDI MAGISTER, because he deprives boys of their play.” And yet, on the other hand, he thought it might bear a very different interpretation, and refer to his own exquisite art in arranging pageants, morris-dances, May-day festivities, and such-like holiday delights, for which he assured Tressilian he had positively the purest and the most inventive brain in England; insomuch, that his cunning in framing such pleasures had made him known to many honourable persons, both in country and court, and especially to the noble Earl of Leicester.
It was impossible to look at the little man without some disposition to laugh, especially when Gammer Sludge, seizing upon and kissing him, in spite of his struggling and kicking in reply to her caresses, termed him her own precious pearl of beauty.
“RICARDE,” said the preceptor, “you must forthwith (which is PROFECTO) set forth so far as the top of the hill, and show this man of worship Wayland Smith&#39;s workshop.” “A proper errand of a morning,” said the boy, in better language than Tressilian expected; “and who knows but the devil may fly away with me before I come back?” “Ay, marry may un,” said Dame Sludge; “and you might have thought twice, Master Domine, ere you sent my dainty darling on arrow such errand.
“Oh, if I were to ask it just now,” said the boy, “you would deny it me; but I will wait till we meet at court.” “At court, Richard!
are you bound for court?” said Tressilian.
“I warrant me, you think, what should such an ill-favoured, scrambling urchin do at court?
“I do well remember the night you speak of--one of the few happy evenings my life has known.” “She is gone, then,” said the smith, interpreting after his own fashion the sigh with which Tressilian uttered these words--“she is gone, young, beautiful, and beloved as she was!--I crave your worship&#39;s pardon--I should have hammered on another theme.
But ours were a comfortable people.” “Very true, Dame Crank,” said the hostler; “so said Simpkins of Simonburn when the curate kissed his wife,--&#39;They are a comfortable people,&#39; said he.” “Silence, thou foul-mouthed vermin,” said Dame Crank; “is it fit for a heretic horse-boy like thee to handle such a text as the Catholic clergy?” “In troth no, dame,” replied the man of oats; “and as you yourself are now no text for their handling, dame, whatever may have been the case in your day, I think we had e&#39;en better leave un alone.” At this last exchange of sarcasm, Dame Crank set up her throat, and began a horrible exclamation against Jack Hostler, under cover of which Tressilian and his attendant escaped into the house.
Tressilian hastily rode over the drawbridge, entered the court, and began to call loudly on the domestics by their names.
“Lord love you,” he said, “Master Edmund, be it thou in flesh and fell?
But no, no, dame, said I, it is the heart, it is the heart.” “Can ye not stir his mind to any pastimes?” said Tressilian.
It was my nightly prayer that I should see Amy and Edmund wedded,--had it been granted, it had now been gall added to bitterness.” “Be comforted, my friend,” said the curate, addressing Sir Hugh, “it cannot be that the daughter of all our hopes and affections is the vile creature you would bespeak her.” “Oh, no,” replied Sir Hugh impatiently, “I were wrong to name broadly the base thing she is become--there is some new court name for it, I warrant me.
“I have not suffered so much since I was torn away from my beloved flock, and compelled to abandon them to the Romish wolves.” “That was in TERTIO MARIAE,” said Master Mumblazen.
He resisted for a while the proposal made by his friends that Tressilian should undertake a journey to court, to attempt the recovery of his daughter, and the redress of her wrongs, in so far as they might yet be repaired.
“Let her go,” he said; “she is but a hawk that goes down the wind; I would not bestow even a whistle to reclaim her.” But though he for some time maintained this argument, he was at length convinced it was his duty to take the part to which natural affection inclined him, and consent that such efforts as could yet be made should be used by Tressilian in behalf of his daughter.
“You are going to court, Master Tressilian,” said he; “you will please remember that your blazonry must be ARGENT and OR--no other tinctures will pass current.” The remark was equally just and embarrassing.
To prosecute a suit at court, ready money was as indispensable even in the golden days of Elizabeth as at any succeeding period; and it was a commodity little at the command of the inhabitants of Lidcote Hall.
While Tressilian was making preparations for his departure early the ensuing morning, Wayland Smith desired to speak with him, and, expressing his hope that he had been pleased with the operation of his medicine in behalf of Sir Hugh Robsart, added his desire to accompany him to court.
“Here is a serving-man on the bonniest grey tit I ever see&#39;d in my life,” said Will Badger, who got the start--“having on his arm a silver cognizance, being a fire-drake holding in his mouth a brickbat, under a coronet of an Earl&#39;s degree,” said Master Mumblazen, “and bearing a letter sealed of the same.” Tressilian took the letter, which was addressed “To the worshipful Master Edmund Tressilian, our loving kinsman--These--ride, ride, ride--for thy life, for thy life, for thy life.” He then opened it, and found the following contents:-- “MASTER TRESSILIAN, OUR GOOD FRIEND AND COUSIN, “We are at present so ill at ease, and otherwise so unhappily circumstanced, that we are desirous to have around us those of our friends on whose loving-kindness we can most especially repose confidence; amongst whom we hold our good Master Tressilian one of the foremost and nearest, both in good will and good ability.
And so we bid you heartily farewell, being your loving kinsman to command, “RATCLIFFE, EARL OF SUSSEX.” “Send up the messenger instantly, Will Badger,” said Tressilian; and as the man entered the room, he exclaimed, “Ah, Stevens, is it you?
It was Tressilian&#39;s purpose to go down directly to Deptford, where Lord Sussex resided, in order to be near the court, then held at Greenwich, the favourite residence of Elizabeth, and honoured as her birthplace.
“Take thy sword and buckler, and follow me, then,” said Tressilian; “I am about to walk myself, and we will go in company.” This he said, because he was not altogether so secure of the fidelity of his new retainer as to lose sight of him at this interesting moment, when rival factions at the court of Elizabeth were running so high.
Permit me,” he added, “to walk before you, for we are now to quit the broad street and we will make double speed if I lead the way.” Tressilian acquiesced, and, following the smith down a lane which turned to the left hand towards the river, he found that his guide walked on with great speed, and apparently perfect knowledge of the town, through a labyrinth of by-streets, courts, and blind alleys, until at length Wayland paused in the midst of a very narrow lane, the termination of which showed a peep of the Thames looking misty and muddy, which background was crossed saltierwise, as Mr. Mumblazen might have said, by the masts of two lighters that lay waiting for the tide.
To finesse--to hold the cards--to oppose one interest to another--to bridle him who thought himself highest in her esteem, by the fears he must entertain of another equally trusted, if not equally beloved, were arts which she used throughout her reign, and which enabled her, though frequently giving way to the weakness of favouritism, to prevent most of its evil effects on her kingdom and government.
But in person, features, and address, weapons so formidable in the court of a female sovereign, Leicester had advantages more than sufficient to counterbalance the military services, high blood, and frank bearing of the Earl of Sussex; and he bore, in the eye of the court and kingdom, the higher share in Elizabeth&#39;s favour, though (for such was her uniform policy) by no means so decidedly expressed as to warrant him against the final preponderance of his rival&#39;s pretensions.
Meanwhile--for in that old time men never forgot the probability that the matter might be determined by length of sword--the retainers of each noble flocked around their patron, appeared well armed in the vicinity of the court itself, and disturbed the ear of the sovereign by their frequent and alarming debates, held even within the precincts of her palace.
“The man who raises the devil may be honest, but he is answerable for the mischief which the fiend does, for all that.” “And is this all of you, my mates,” inquired Tressilian, “that are about my lord in his utmost straits?” “No, no,” replied the elder gentleman, “there are Tracy, Markham, and several more; but we keep watch here by two at once, and some are weary and are sleeping in the gallery above.” “And some,” said the young man, “are gone down to the Dock yonder at Deptford, to look out such a hull; as they may purchase by clubbing their broken fortunes; and as soon as all is over, we will lay our noble lord in a noble green grave, have a blow at those who have hurried him thither, if opportunity suits, and then sail for the Indies with heavy hearts and light purses.” “It may be,” said Tressilian, “that I will embrace the same purpose, so soon as I have settled some business at court.” “Thou business at court!” they both exclaimed at once, “and thou make the Indian voyage!” “Why, Tressilian,” said the younger man, “art thou not wedded, and beyond these flaws of fortune, that drive folks out to sea when their bark bears fairest for the haven?--What has become of the lovely Indamira that was to match my Amoret for truth and beauty?” “Speak not of her!” said Tressilian, averting his face.
The Earl received him with the most friendly cordiality, and inquired into the state of his courtship.
Commend me to my noble and princely Mistress; and say that I live and die her true servant, and wish to all about her throne the same singleness of heart and will to serve her, with more ability to do so than hath been assigned to poor Thomas Ratcliffe.” He then folded his hands, and seemed for a second or two absorbed in mental devotion, then took the potion in his hand, and, pausing, regarded Wayland with a look that seemed designed to penetrate his very soul, but which caused no anxiety or hesitation in the countenance or manner of the artist.
The young gallant, whom we noticed in our last chapter, had left the room for a few minutes, to learn the cause of a knocking at the outward gate, and on his return was so struck with the forlorn and ghastly aspects of his companions of the watch that he exclaimed, “Pity of my heart, my masters, how like owls you look!
Nevertheless, loving and, honouring my lord as truly as thou, or any one, I do say that, should Heaven take him from us, all England&#39;s manhood dies not with him.” “Ay,” replied Blount, “a good portion will survive with thee, doubtless.” “And a good portion with thyself, Blount, and with stout Markham here, and Tracy, and all of us.
My ambition will keep my brain at work, I warrant thee.” “I pray to God it does not drive thee mad,” said Blount; “for my part, if we lose our noble lord, I bid adieu to the court and to the camp both.
I have five hundred foul acres in Norfolk, and thither will I, and change the court pantoufle for the country hobnail.” “O base transmutation!” exclaimed his antagonist; “thou hast already got the true rustic slouch--thy shoulders stoop, as if thine hands were at the stilts of the plough; and thou hast a kind of earthy smell about thee, instead of being perfumed with essence, as a gallant and courtier should.
“Thus, then, off fly the dreams of court favour thou hast nourished,” said Blount, “and despite all thy boasted art and ambition, Devonshire will see thee shine a true younger brother, fit to sit low at the board, carve turn about with the chaplain, look that the hounds be fed, and see the squire&#39;s girths drawn when he goes a-hunting.” “Not so,” said the young man, colouring, “not while Ireland and the Netherlands have wars, and not while the sea hath pathless waves.
I go to walk in the court and look to the sentinels.” “The lad hath quicksilver in his veins, that is certain,” said Blount, looking at Markham.
But in closing the door against Masters, he hath done a daring and loving piece of service; for Tressilian&#39;s fellow hath ever averred that to wake the Earl were death, and Masters would wake the Seven Sleepers themselves, if he thought they slept not by the regular ordinance of medicine.” Morning was well advanced when Tressilian, fatigued and over-watched, came down to the hall with the joyful intelligence that the Earl had awakened of himself, that he found his internal complaints much mitigated, and spoke with a cheerfulness, and looked round with a vivacity, which of themselves showed a material and favourable change had taken place.
“I go not with thee to court unless as a gentleman should.” “Why,” Said Blount, “thy braveries are like to dazzle the eyes of none but some poor groom or porter.” “I know that,” said the youth; “but I am resolved I will have my own cloak, ay, and brush my doublet to boot, ere I stir forth with you.” “Well, well,” said Blount, “here is a coil about a doublet and a cloak.
There is at no court in Europe a man more skilled in this holy and most useful science than Doctor Masters, and he came from Us to our subject.
Nevertheless, he found the gate of Sayes Court defended by men with culverins, as if it had been on the borders of Scotland, not in the vicinity of our court; and when he demanded admittance in our name, it was stubbornly refused.
And here,” she added, giving him a jewel of gold, in the form of a chess-man, “I give thee this to wear at the collar.” Raleigh, to whom nature had taught intuitively, as it were, those courtly arts which many scarce acquire from long experience, knelt, and, as he took from her hand the jewel, kissed the fingers which gave it.
He knew, perhaps, better than almost any of the courtiers who surrounded her, how to mingle the devotion claimed by the Queen with the gallantry due to her personal beauty; and in this, his first attempt to unite them, he succeeded so well as at once to gratify Elizabeth&#39;s personal vanity and her love of power.
Luck hath done indifferent well for me this morning; for I trust I have spoiled a cloak, and made a court fortune.
Not that the Queen&#39;s custom of visiting her more distinguished nobility, whether in health or sickness, could be unknown to him; but the suddenness of the communication left no time for those preparations with which he well knew Elizabeth loved to be greeted, and the rudeness and confusion of his military household, much increased by his late illness, rendered him altogether unprepared for her reception.
Besides, he was low of stature, and, though broad-shouldered, athletic, and fit for martial achievements, his presence in a peaceful hall was not such as ladies love to look upon; a personal disadvantage, which was supposed to give Sussex, though esteemed and honoured by his Sovereign, considerable disadvantage when compared with Leicester, who was alike remarkable for elegance of manners and for beauty of person.
“I am ordered to attend court to-morrow,” said Leicester, speaking to Varney, “to meet, as they surmise, my Lord of Sussex.
&#39;If marriage is permitted,&#39; she said, &#39;I nowhere read that it is enjoined.
&#39;” “She likes not marriages, or speech of marriage, among churchmen,” said Leicester.
She hath added another to those dangling satellites whom it is her pleasure to keep revolving around her.” “Your lordship meaneth that Raleigh, the Devonshire youth,” said Varney--“the Knight of the Cloak, as they call him at court?” “He may be Knight of the Garter one day, for aught I know,” said Leicester, “for he advances rapidly--she hath capped verses with him, and such fooleries.
Let not your heart fail you, my lord, and all shall be well.” “My heart never failed me, sir,” replied Leicester.
He that would climb a tree, my lord, must grasp by the branches, not by the blossom.” “Well, well, well!” said Leicester impatiently; “I understand thy meaning--my heart shall neither fail me nor seduce me.
I trust, though, he has remembered that I am an old soldier, and would have no more of these follies than needs must.” “Nay, I understand nought about it,” said Blount; “but here are your honourable lordship&#39;s brave kinsmen and friends coming in by scores to wait upon you to court, where, methinks, we shall bear as brave a front as Leicester, let him ruffle it as he will.” “Give them the strictest charges,” said Sussex, “that they suffer no provocation short of actual violence to provoke them into quarrel.
But the step was irrevocable, and Sussex escaped from further discussing it by dismissing his company, with the command, “Let all be in order at eleven o&#39;clock; I must be at court and in the presence by high noon precisely.” While the rival statesmen were thus anxiously preparing for their approaching meeting in the Queen&#39;s presence, even Elizabeth herself was not without apprehension of what might chance from the collision of two such fiery spirits, each backed by a strong and numerous body of followers, and dividing betwixt them, either openly or in secret, the hopes and wishes of most of her court.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I will have in this court, ay, and in this realm, but one mistress, and no master.
We will brook no mayor of the palace here.” Bowyer kissed the hand which she extended towards him, and withdrew to his post, astonished at the success of his own audacity.
You also must needs ruffle in the court of England, at the head of a faction of your own?” “My followers, gracious Princess,” said Sussex, “have indeed ruffled in your cause in Ireland, in Scotland, and against yonder rebellious Earls in the north.
I tell you, no king in Christendom will less brook his court to be cumbered, his people oppressed, and his kingdom&#39;s peace disturbed, by the arrogance of overgrown power, than she who now speaks with you.--My Lord of Leicester, and you, my Lord of Sussex, I command you both to be friends with each other; or by the crown I wear, you shall find an enemy who will be too strong for both of you!” “Madam,” said the Earl of Leicester, “you who are yourself the fountain of honour know best what is due to mine.
For, my lords, I tell you plainly, your follies and your brawls lead to strange disorders among your servants.--My Lord of Leicester, you have a gentleman in your household called Varney?” “Yes, gracious madam,” replied Leicester; “I presented him to kiss your royal hand when you were last at Nonsuch.” “His outside was well enough,” said the Queen, “but scarce so fair, I should have thought, as to have caused a maiden of honourable birth and hopes to barter her fame for his good looks, and become his paramour.
“Call Masters--call our surgeon in ordinary.--Where be these loitering fools?--we lose the pride of our court through their negligence.--Or is it possible, Leicester,” she continued, looking on him with a very gentle aspect, “can fear of my displeasure have wrought so deeply on thee?
Wait the change of the tide; it is even now on the turn.” The acute observation of Raleigh, perhaps, did not deceive him; for Leicester&#39;s confusion was so great, and, indeed, for the moment, so irresistibly overwhelming, that Elizabeth, after looking at him with a wondering eye, and receiving no intelligible answer to the unusual expressions of grace and affection which had escaped from her, shot her quick glance around the circle of courtiers, and reading, perhaps, in their faces something that accorded with her own awakened suspicions, she said suddenly, “Or is there more in this than we see--or than you, my lord, wish that we should see?
“Is it true, sirrah,” said the Queen, with one of those searching looks which few had the audacity to resist, “that you have seduced to infamy a young lady of birth and breeding, the daughter of Sir Hugh Robsart of Lidcote Hall?” Varney kneeled down, and replied, with a look of the most profound contrition, “There had been some love passages betwixt him and Mistress Amy Robsart.” Leicester&#39;s flesh quivered with indignation as he heard his dependant make this avowal, and for one moment he manned himself to step forward, and, bidding farewell to the court and the royal favour, confess the whole mystery of the secret marriage.
and why not ask the wench&#39;s hand from her father, if thou hadst any honesty in thy love for her?” “An it please your Grace,” said Varney, still on his knees, “I dared not do so, for her father had promised her hand to a gentleman of birth and honour--I will do him justice, though I know he bears me ill-will--one Master Edmund Tressilian, whom I now see in the presence.” “Soh!” replied the Queen.
“And what was your right to make the simple fool break her worthy father&#39;s contract, through your love PASSAGES, as your conceit and assurance terms them?” “Madam,” replied Varney, “it is in vain to plead the cause of human frailty before a judge to whom it is unknown, or that of love to one who never yields to the passion”--he paused an instant, and then added, in a very low and timid tone--“which she inflicts upon all others.” Elizabeth tried to frown, but smiled in her own despite, as she answered, “Thou art a marvellously impudent knave.
Art thou married to the girl?” Leicester&#39;s feelings became so complicated and so painfully intense, that it seemed to him as if his life was to depend on the answer made by Varney, who, after a moment&#39;s real hesitation, answered, “Yes.” “Thou false villain!” said Leicester, bursting forth into rage, yet unable to add another word to the sentence which he had begun with such emphatic passion.
“From whence, madam, I cannot guess; but I am so near to his person that I know he has ever since worn, suspended around his neck and next to his heart, that lock of hair which sustains a small golden jewel shaped like a heart.
Methinks, without prying into my Lord of Leicester&#39;s amorous secrets, I would fain know what kind of locks are like the thread of Minerva&#39;s web, or the--what was it?--the last rays of the May-day sun.” Varney looked round the presence-chamber, his eye travelling from one lady to another, until at length it rested upon the Queen herself, but with an aspect of the deepest veneration.
“I see no tresses,” he said, “in this presence, worthy of such similies, unless where I dare not look on them.” “How, sir knave?” said the Queen; “dare you intimate--” “Nay, madam,” replied Varney, shading his eyes with his hand, “it was the beams of the May-day sun that dazzled my weak eyes.” “Go to--go to,” said the Queen; “thou art a foolish fellow”--and turning quickly from him she walked up to Leicester.
Intense curiosity, mingled with all the various hopes, fears, and passions which influence court faction, had occupied the presence-chamber during the Queen&#39;s conference with Varney, as if with the strength of an Eastern talisman.
The atmosphere was contagious, and Leicester, who saw all around wishing or fearing his advancement or his fall forgot all that love had previously dictated, and saw nothing for the instant but the favour or disgrace which depended on the nod of Elizabeth and the fidelity of Varney.
Elizabeth did not long leave him in doubt; for the more than favour with which she accosted him decided his triumph in the eyes of his rival, and of the assembled court of England.
I would that my heart itself lay before you, barer than the tongue of any servant could strip it.” “What, my lord,” said Elizabeth, looking kindly upon him, “is there no one little corner over which you would wish to spread a veil?
The mingled emotions which had at first overcome him had now given way to the energetic vigour with which he had determined to support his place in the Queen&#39;s favour; and never did he seem to Elizabeth more eloquent, more handsome, more interesting, than while, kneeling at her feet, he conjured her to strip him of all his power, but to leave him the name of her servant.--“Take from the poor Dudley,” he exclaimed, “all that your bounty has made him, and bid him be the poor gentleman he was when your Grace first shone on him; leave him no more than his cloak and his sword, but let him still boast he has--what in word or deed he never forfeited--the regard of his adored Queen and mistress!” “No, Dudley!” said Elizabeth, raising him with one hand, while she extended the other that he might kiss it.
Rise, my lord, and let my hand go--rise, and be what you have ever been, the grace of our court and the support of our throne!
Your true affection, as I will hold it to be, hath been, it seems, but ill requited; but you have scholarship, and you know there have been false Cressidas to be found, from the Trojan war downwards.
Forget, good sir, this Lady Light o&#39; Love--teach your affection to see with a wiser eye.
Thou shalt not be forgotten thyself, Tressilian--follow our court, and thou shalt see that a true Troilus hath some claim on our grace.
But I hold this Varney&#39;s word no good warrant for the truth.” “Had that doubt been elsewhere urged,” answered Varney, “my sword--” “THY sword!” interrupted Tressilian scornfully; “with her Grace&#39;s leave, my sword shall show--” “Peace, you knaves, both!” said the Queen; “know you where you are?--This comes of your feuds, my lords,” she added, looking towards Leicester and Sussex; “your followers catch your own humour, and must bandy and brawl in my court and in my very presence, like so many Matamoros.--Look you, sirs, he that speaks of drawing swords in any other quarrel than mine or England&#39;s, by mine honour, I&#39;ll bracelet him with iron both on wrist and ankle!” She then paused a minute, and resumed in a milder tone, “I must do justice betwixt the bold and mutinous knaves notwithstanding.--My Lord of Leicester, will you warrant with your honour--that is, to the best of your belief--that your servant speaks truth in saying he hath married this Amy Robsart?” This was a home-thrust, and had nearly staggered Leicester.
But he had now gone too far to recede, and answered, after a moment&#39;s hesitation, “To the best of my belief--indeed on my certain knowledge--she is a wedded wife.” “Gracious madam,” said Tressilian, “may I yet request to know, when and under what circumstances this alleged marriage--” “Out, sirrah,” answered the Queen; “ALLEGED marriage!
Never was more anxious and ready way made for “my Lord of Leicester,” than as he passed through the crowded anterooms to go towards the river-side, in order to attend her Majesty to her barge--never was the voice of the ushers louder, to “make room, make room for the noble Earl”--never were these signals more promptly and reverently obeyed--never were more anxious eyes turned on him to obtain a glance of favour, or even of mere recognition, while the heart of many a humble follower throbbed betwixt the desire to offer his congratulations, and the fear of intruding himself on the notice of one so infinitely above him.
The whole court considered the issue of this day&#39;s audience, expected with so much doubt and anxiety, as a decisive triumph on the part of Leicester, and felt assured that the orb of his rival satellite, if not altogether obscured by his lustre, must revolve hereafter in a dimmer and more distant sphere.
So thought the court and courtiers, from high to low; and they acted accordingly.
Why come they not to court?--Adams, your suit is naught; the Queen will grant no more monopolies.
But I may serve you in another matter.--My good Alderman Aylford, the suit of the City, affecting Queenhithe, shall be forwarded as far as my poor interest can serve.--Master Edmund Spenser, touching your Irish petition, I would willingly aid you, from my love to the Muses; but thou hast nettled the Lord Treasurer.” “My lord,” said the poet, “were I permitted to explain--” “Come to my lodging, Edmund,” answered the Earl “not to-morrow, or next day, but soon.--Ha, Will Shakespeare--wild Will!--thou hast given my nephew Philip Sidney, love-powder; he cannot sleep without thy Venus and Adonis under his pillow!
Come to Kenilworth, if you list; there will be store of fools there besides, and so you will be fitted.” “Nay, an there be fools, my lord,” replied Laneham, with much glee, “I warrant I will make sport among them, for no greyhound loves to cote a hare as I to turn and course a fool.
Now, take her with me I may not, her Highness&#39;s orders being so strict against the officers bringing with them their wives in a progress, and so lumbering the court with womankind.
The angry spot was, however, on the Queen&#39;s cheek, as, in that cold tone with which superiors endeavour to veil their internal agitation, while speaking to those before whom it would be derogation to express it, she pronounced the chilling words, “We have waited, my Lord of Leicester.” “Madam, and most gracious Princess,” said Leicester, “you, who can pardon so many weaknesses which your own heart never knows, can best bestow your commiseration on the agitations of the bosom, which, for a moment, affect both head and limbs.
He is a stout man at quarter-staff, and single falchion, though, as I am told, a halting fellow; and he stood, they say, a tough fight with the rangers of old Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecot, when he broke his deer-park and kissed his keeper&#39;s daughter.” “I cry you mercy, my Lord of Sussex,” said Queen Elizabeth, interrupting him; “that matter was heard in council, and we will not have this fellow&#39;s offence exaggerated--there was no kissing in the matter, and the defendant hath put the denial on record.
Valour never shines to more advantage than when united with the true taste and love of letters.
But surely there are some others among our young courtiers who can recollect what your lordship has forgotten amid weightier affairs.--Master Tressilian, you are described to me as a worshipper of Minerva--remember you aught of these lines?” Tressilian&#39;s heart was too heavy, his prospects in life too fatally blighted, to profit by the opportunity which the Queen thus offered to him of attracting her attention; but he determined to transfer the advantage to his more ambitious young friend, and excusing himself on the score of want of recollection, he added that he believed the beautiful verses of which my Lord of Leicester had spoken were in the remembrance of Master Walter Raleigh.
Foreign countries--their customs, their manners, the rules of their courts--the fashions, and even the dress of their ladies-were equally his theme; and seldom did he conclude without conveying some compliment, always couched in delicacy, and expressed with propriety, to the Virgin Queen, her court, and her government.
Thus passed the conversation during this pleasure voyage, seconded by the rest of the attendants upon the royal person, in gay discourse, varied by remarks upon ancient classics and modern authors, and enriched by maxims of deep policy and sound morality, by the statesmen and sages who sat around and mixed wisdom with the lighter talk of a female court.
After a moderate interval, the court again met in the splendid gardens of the Palace; and it was while thus engaged that the Queen suddenly asked a lady, who was near to her both in place and favour, what had become of the young Squire Lack-Cloak.
Raleigh, in the meanwhile, stole back to the window, and read, with a feeling of intoxication, the encouragement thus given him by the Queen in person to follow out his ambitious career, and returned to Sussex and his retinue, then on the point of embarking to go up the river, his heart beating high with gratified pride, and with hope of future distinction.
The reverence due to the person of the Earl prevented any notice being taken of the reception he had met with at court, until they had landed, and the household were assembled in the great hall at Sayes Court; while that lord, exhausted by his late illness and the fatigues of the day, had retired to his chamber, demanding the attendance of Wayland, his successful physician.
But I fear for thee, Walter” (and he wiped his honest eye), “I fear for thee with all my heart.
“I was not mistaken,” said Wayland; “he that once hath his features by heart would know him amongst a million.
I had business for you in Berkshire, but in the opposite extremity to the place where thou art known; and ere thou hadst found out this new reason for living private, I had settled to send thee thither upon a secret embassage.” The artist expressed himself willing to receive his commands, and Tressilian, knowing he was well acquainted with the outline of his business at court, frankly explained to him the whole, mentioned the agreement which subsisted betwixt Giles Gosling and him, and told what had that day been averred in the presence-chamber by Varney, and supported by Leicester.
Your lordship was present in person, and might have contradicted me and ruined yourself by an avowal of the truth; but surely it was no part of a faithful servant to have done so without your commands.” “I cannot deny it, Varney,” said the Earl, rising and walking across the room; “my own ambition has been traitor to my love.” “Say rather, my lord, that your love has been traitor to your greatness, and barred you from such a prospect of honour and power as the world cannot offer to any other.
Had Mary had the hap to have wedded the noble Earl ONCE destined to share her throne, she had experienced a husband of different metal; and her husband had found in her a wife as complying and loving as the mate of the meanest squire who follows the hounds a-horseback, and holds her husband&#39;s bridle as he mounts.” “It might have been as thou sayest, Varney,” said Leicester, a brief smile of self-satisfaction passing over his anxious countenance.
But not with Elizabeth, Varney for I thank God, when he gave her the heart of a woman, gave her the head of a man to control its follies.
She will accept love-tokens, ay, and requite them with the like--put sugared sonnets in her bosom, ay, and answer them too--push gallantry to the very verge where it becomes exchange of affection; but she writes NIL ULTRA to all which is to follow, and would not barter one iota of her own supreme power for all the alphabet of both Cupid and Hymen.” “The better for you, my lord,” said Varney--“that is, in the case supposed, if such be her disposition; since you think you cannot aspire to become her husband.
Her religious scruples are solved; she is an honoured and beloved wife, enjoying the society of her husband at such times as his weightier duties permit him to afford her his company.
I am right sure that a lady so gentle and so loving would consent to live her life through in a certain obscurity--which is, after all, not dimmer than when she was at Lidcote Hall--rather than diminish the least jot of her lord&#39;s honours and greatness by a premature attempt to share them.” “There is something in what thou sayest,” said Leicester, “and her appearance here were fatal.
Indeed, the wish to pry into futurity, so general among the human race, is peculiarly to be found amongst those who trade in state mysteries and the dangerous intrigues and cabals of courts.
“The stars intimate yet a prouder title, yet an higher rank.
Here Venus, ascendant in the House of Life, and conjoined with Sol, showers down that flood of silver light, blent with gold, which promises power, wealth, dignity, all that the proud heart of man desires, and in such abundance that never the future Augustus of that old and mighty Rome heard from his HARUSPICES such a tale of glory, as from this rich text my lore might read to my favourite son.” “Thou dost but jest with me, father,” said the Earl, astonished at the strain of enthusiasm in which the astrologer delivered his prediction.
The infortune is threatened by the malignant and adverse aspect, through means of a youth, and, as I think, a rival; but whether in love or in prince&#39;s favour, I know not nor can I give further indication respecting him, save that he comes from the western quarter.” “The western--ha!” replied Leicester, “it is enough--the tempest does indeed brew in that quarter!
Be faithful--be secret--obey the directions thou shalt receive from my master of the horse, and grudge not a little seclusion or restraint in my cause--it shall be richly considered.--Here, Varney--conduct this venerable man to thine own lodging; tend him heedfully in all things, but see that he holds communication with no one.” Varney bowed, and the astrologer kissed the Earl&#39;s hand in token of adieu, and followed the master of the horse to another apartment, in which were placed wine and refreshments for his use.
“Saw you my signal from the court beneath?” “I did,” said Alasco, for by such name he was at present called, “and shaped the horoscope accordingly.” “And it passed upon the patron without challenge?” continued Varney.
Hath not Art, thinkest thou, the means of completing Nature&#39;s imperfect concoctions in her attempts to form the precious metals, even as by art we can perfect those other operations of incubation, distillation, fermentation, and similar processes of an ordinary description, by which we extract life itself out of a senseless egg, summon purity and vitality out of muddy dregs, or call into vivacity the inert substance of a sluggish liquid?” “I have heard all this before,” said Varney, “and my heart is proof against such cant ever since I sent twenty good gold pieces (marry, it was in the nonage of my wit) to advance the grand magisterium, all which, God help the while, vanished IN FUMO.
shall we not collogue together, and warm the cockles of our ancient kindness?--shall we not collogue, I say?” “With all my heart, kinsman,” said mine host, who obviously wished to be rid of him; “but are you to stand shot to all this good liquor?” This is a question has quelled many a jovial toper, but it moved not the purpose of Lambourne&#39;s soul, “Question my means, nuncle?” he said, producing a handful of mixed gold and silver pieces; “question Mexico and Peru--question the Queen&#39;s exchequer--God save her Majesty!--she is my good Lord&#39;s good mistress.” “Well, kinsman,” said mine host, “it is my business to sell wine to those who can buy it--so, Jack Tapster, do me thine office.
Why, thou canst give a friend a sly place at a mask or a revel now, Mike; ay, or, I warrant thee, thou canst say in my lord&#39;s ear, when my honourable lord is down in these parts, and wants a Spanish ruff or the like--thou canst say in his ear, There is mine old friend, young Lawrence Goldthred of Abingdon, has as good wares, lawn, tiffany, cambric, and so forth--ay, and is as pretty a piece of man&#39;s flesh, too, as is in Berkshire, and will ruffle it for your lordship with any man of his inches; and thou mayest say--” “I can say a hundred d--d lies besides, mercer,” answered Lambourne; “what, one must not stand upon a good word for a friend!” “Here is to thee, Mike, with all my heart,” said the mercer; “and thou canst tell one the reality of the new fashions too.
“But how to bring her to a moment&#39;s serious reflection?” Then as he exhibited his choicest collection of essences and perfumes, he at once arrested her attention by observing that these articles had almost risen to double value since the magnificent preparations made by the Earl of Leicester to entertain the Queen and court at his princely Castle of Kenilworth.
The amount of a small turkey-bean, swallowed daily for a week, fortifies the heart against those black vapours which arise from solitude, melancholy, unrequited affection, disappointed hope--” “Are you a fool, friend?” said the Countess sharply; “or do you think, because I have good-naturedly purchased your trumpery goods at your roguish prices, that you may put any gullery you will on me?
Who ever heard that affections of the heart were cured by medicines given to the body?” “Under your honourable favour,” said Wayland, “I am an honest man, and I have sold my goods at an honest price.
I say not it will cure a rooted affection of the mind, which only God and time can do; but I say that this restorative relieves the black vapours which are engendered in the body of that melancholy which broodeth on the mind.
I have relieved many with it, both in court and city, and of late one Master Edmund Tressilian, a worshipful gentleman in Cornwall, who, on some slight received, it was told me, where he had set his affections, was brought into that state of melancholy which made his friends alarmed for his life.” He paused, and the lady remained silent for some time, and then asked, with a voice which she strove in vain to render firm and indifferent in its tone, “Is the gentleman you have mentioned perfectly recovered?” “Passably, madam,” answered Wayland; “he hath at least no bodily complaint.” “I will take some of the medicine, Janet,” said the Countess.
She even took the first dose upon the instant, and professed to feel her heart lightened and her spirits augmented--a consequence which, in all probability, existed only in her own imagination.
“Maiden,” he said, “thou hast the face of one who should love her mistress.
“For the love of Heaven, no violence!” said the astrologer.
I would kiss thee, mine honest infractor of the Lex Julia (as they said at Leyden), didst thou not flavour so damnably of sulphur, and such fiendish apothecary&#39;s stuff.--Here goes it, up seyes--to Varney and Leicester two more noble mounting spirits--and more dark-seeking, deep-diving, high-flying, malicious, ambitious miscreants--well, I say no more, but I will whet my dagger on his heart-spone that refuses to pledge me!
Fame asserted of this zealous retainer that he had accommodated his lord in former love intrigues; and it occurred to Wayland Smith that Leicester himself might be the party chiefly interested.
Her marriage with the Earl he could not suspect; but even the discovery of such a passing intrigue with a lady of Mistress Amy Robsart&#39;s rank was a secret of the deepest importance to the stability of the favourite&#39;s power over Elizabeth.
He was perpetually by her side in council--willingly listened to in the moments of courtly recreation--favoured with approaches even to familiar intimacy--looked up to by all who had aught to hope at court--courted by foreign ministers with the most flattering testimonies of respect from their sovereigns,--the ALTER EGO, as it seemed, of the stately Elizabeth, who was now very generally supposed to be studying the time and opportunity for associating him, by marriage, into her sovereign power.
These great and sage statesmen were judged of by the Queen only with reference to the measures they suggested, and the reasons by which they supported their opinions in council; whereas the success of Leicester&#39;s course depended on all those light and changeable gales of caprice and humour which thwart or favour the progress of a lover in the favour of his mistress, and she, too, a mistress who was ever and anon becoming fearful lest she should forget the dignity, or compromise the authority, of the Queen, while she indulged the affections of the woman.
At such moments his thoughts turned to dwell upon his secret marriage and its consequences; and it was in bitterness against himself, if not against his unfortunate Countess, that he ascribed to that hasty measure, adopted in the ardour of what he now called inconsiderate passion, at once the impossibility of placing his power on a solid basis, and the immediate prospect of its precipitate downfall.
“Men say,” thus ran his thoughts, in these anxious and repentant moments, “that I might marry Elizabeth, and become King of England.
And she speaks as if Elizabeth were to receive the knowledge of this matter with the glee of a mother hearing of the happy marriage of a hopeful son!
She, the daughter of Henry, who spared neither man in his anger nor woman in his desire--she to find herself tricked, drawn on with toys of passion to the verge of acknowledging her love to a subject, and he discovered to be a married man!--Elizabeth to learn that she had been dallied with in such fashion, as a gay courtier might trifle with a country wench--we should then see, to our ruin, FURENS QUID FAEMINA!” He would then pause, and call for Varney, whose advice was now more frequently resorted to than ever, because the Earl remembered the remonstrances which he had made against his secret contract.
Such feats have been performed in the courts of as sharp-eyed monarchs as Queen Elizabeth.” “Utter madness, Varney,” answered the Earl; “the counterfeit would be confronted with Tressilian, and discovery become inevitable.” “Tressilian might be removed from court,” said the unhesitating Varney.
Many others there be at court to whom Amy may be known; and besides, on the absence of Tressilian, her father or some of her friends would be instantly summoned hither.
Urge thine invention once more.” “My lord, I know not what to say,” answered Varney; “but were I myself in such perplexity, I would ride post down to Cumnor Place, and compel my wife to give her consent to such measures as her safety and mine required.” “Varney,” said Leicester, “I cannot urge her to aught so repugnant to her noble nature as a share in this stratagem; it would be a base requital to the love she bears me.” “Well, my lord,” said Varney, “your lordship is a wise and an honourable man, and skilled in those high points of romantic scruple which are current in Arcadia perhaps, as your nephew, Philip Sidney, writes.
And such is my opinion of my lady&#39;s love for your lordship, and of her willingness to do that which is at once to contribute to your pleasure and your safety, that I am sure she will condescend to bear for a few brief days the name of so humble a man as myself, especially since it is not inferior in antiquity to that of her own paternal house.” Leicester seized on writing materials, and twice or thrice commenced a letter to the Countess, which he afterwards tore into fragments.
At the sound the Earl started from his seat, and ran to the window, with the momentary purpose of recalling the unworthy commission with which he had entrusted one of whom he used to say he knew no virtuous property save affection to his patron.
He had brought Lord Leicester to the point which he had desired, of committing to him the most intimate recesses of his breast, and of using him as the channel of his most confidential intercourse with his lady.
Say that my beauty was but small, Among court ladies all despised, Why didst thou rend it from that hall Where, scornful Earl, &#39;twas dearly prized?
No more thou com&#39;st with wonted speed, Thy once beloved bride to see; But be she alive, or be she dead, I fear, stern Earl, &#39;s the same to thee.
If she had not loved to collect finery and to wear it, she might have woven tapestry or sewed embroidery, till her labours spread in gay profusion all over the walls and seats at Lidcote Hall; or she might have varied Minerva&#39;s labours with the task of preparing a mighty pudding against the time that Sir Hugh Robsart returned from the greenwood.
And thus her heart lay readily open, and her fancy became easily captivated by the noble exterior and graceful deportment and complacent flattery of Leicester, even before he was known to her as the dazzling minion of wealth and power.
The frequent visits of Leicester at Cumnor, during the earlier part of their union, had reconciled the Countess to the solitude and privacy to which she was condemned; but when these visits became rarer and more rare, and when the void was filled up with letters of excuse, not always very warmly expressed, and generally extremely brief, discontent and suspicion began to haunt those splendid apartments which love had fitted up for beauty.
Her answers to Leicester conveyed these feelings too bluntly, and pressed more naturally than prudently that she might be relieved from this obscure and secluded residence, by the Earl&#39;s acknowledgment of their marriage; and in arranging her arguments with all the skill she was mistress of, she trusted chiefly to the warmth of the entreaties with which she urged them.
I bore it all with pleasure while I was sure he loved me; but now my tongue and heart shall be free, let them fetter these limbs as they will.
I tell thee, Janet, I love my husband--I will love him till my latest breath--I cannot cease to love him, even if I would, or if he--which, God knows, may chance--should cease to love me.
But I will say, and loudly, I would have been happier than I now am to have remained in Lidcote Hall, even although I must have married poor Tressilian, with his melancholy look and his head full of learning, which I cared not for.
But neither to this lore did the Countess&#39;s heart incline, and joyfully did she start up from the listless task of turning over the leaves of the pamphlets, and hastily did she scatter them through the floor, when the hasty clatter of horses&#39; feet, heard in the courtyard, called her to the window, exclaiming, “It is Leicester!--it is my noble Earl!--it is my Dudley!--every stroke of his horse&#39;s hoof sounds like a note of lordly music!” There was a brief bustle in the mansion, and Foster, with his downward look and sullen manner, entered the apartment to say, “That Master Richard Varney was arrived from my lord, having ridden all night, and craved to speak with her ladyship instantly.” “Varney?” said the disappointed Countess; “and to speak with me?--pshaw!
Varney entered the room in the dress in which he had waited on his master that morning to court, the splendour of which made a strange contrast with the disorder arising from hasty riding during a dark night and foul ways.
Pray, Janet--I would pray myself, but I must listen to what goes on within--evil has been brewing, love--evil has been brewing.
“The villain,” she said--“the cold-blooded, calculating slave!--But I unmasked him, Janet--I made the snake uncoil all his folds before me, and crawl abroad in his naked deformity; I suspended my resentment, at the danger of suffocating under the effort, until he had let me see the very bottom of a heart more foul than hell&#39;s darkest corner.--And thou, Leicester, is it possible thou couldst bid me for a moment deny my wedded right in thee, or thyself yield it to another?--But it is impossible--the villain has lied in all.--Janet, I will not remain here longer--I fear him--I fear thy father.
“Do you leave me, Janet?” said her mistress--“desert me in such an evil strait?” “Desert you, madam!” exclaimed Janet; and running back to her mistress, she imprinted a thousand kisses on her hand--“desert you I--may the Hope of my trust desert me when I do so!
I have lived ill, and the world has been too weighty with me; but she is as innocent as ever she was when on her mother&#39;s lap, and she, at least, shall have her portion in that happy City, whose walls are of pure gold, and the foundations garnished with all manner of precious stones.” “Ay, Tony,” said Varney, “that were a paradise to thy heart&#39;s content.--Debate the matter with him, Doctor Alasco; I will be with you anon.” So speaking, Varney arose, and taking the flask from the table, he left the room.
Oh, who would be a woman?--who that fool, A weeping, pining, faithful, loving woman?
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Receiving no immediate answer--for, perhaps, in the confusion of her mind this very obvious subject of deliberation had not occurred to the Countess,--Janet ventured to add, “Probably to your father&#39;s house, where you are sure of safety and protection?” “No, Janet,” said the lady mournfully; “I left Lidcote Hall while my heart was light and my name was honourable, and I will not return thither till my lord&#39;s permission and public acknowledgment of our marriage restore me to my native home with all the rank and honour which he has bestowed on me.” “And whither will you, then, madam?” said Janet.
“You abuse my situation, Janet,” said the Countess, angrily, “and you forget your own.” “I do neither, dearest madam,” said the sorrowful maiden; “but have you forgotten that the noble Earl has given such strict charges to keep your marriage secret, that he may preserve his court-favour?
But thou seest, my love, I have no desire but to throw my self on my husband&#39;s protection.
She knew what importance the Earl attached to the concealment of their marriage, and could not but own, that by taking any step to make it public without his permission, the Countess would incur, in a high degree, the indignation of her husband.
Thou must be brave, Janet; for though thou art now but the attendant of a distressed and errant lady, who is both nameless and fameless, yet, when we meet again, thou must be dressed as becomes the gentlewoman nearest in love and in service to the first Countess in England.” “Now, may God grant it, dear lady!” said Janet--“not that I may go with gayer apparel, but that we may both wear our kirtles over lighter hearts.” By this time the lock of the postern door had, after some hard wrenching, yielded to the master-key; and the Countess, not without internal shuddering, saw herself beyond the walls which her husband&#39;s strict commands had assigned to her as the boundary of her walks.
“Tomorrow, I say that my lady is unable to rise.” “Ay; and that she hath aching and heaviness of the head a throbbing at the heart, and lists not to be disturbed.
“Adieu, and may the blessing of God wend with you!” said Janet, again kissing her mistress&#39;s hand, who returned her benediction with a mute caress.
And since you are bound for Kenilworth, thither will I too, even for the love of thy sweet face and waggish company.” “Thou shouldst have said my waggish face and sweet company,” said Dickie; “but how wilt thou travel with us--I mean in what character?” “E&#39;en in that thou hast assigned me, to be sure--as a juggler; thou knowest I am used to the craft,” answered Wayland.
“Credit me, I think she IS one and thou art in a sea of troubles about her at this moment, as I can perceive by thy fidgeting.” “Oh, she, man!--she is a poor sister of mine,” said Wayland; “she can sing and play o&#39; the lute would win the fish out o&#39; the stream.” “Let me hear her instantly,” said the boy, “I love the lute rarely; I love it of all things, though I never heard it.” “Then how canst thou love it, Flibbertigibbet?” said Wayland.
“As knights love ladies in old tales,” answered Dickie--“on hearsay.” “Then love it on hearsay a little longer, till my sister is recovered from the fatigue of her journey,” said Wayland; muttering afterwards betwixt his teeth, “The devil take the imp&#39;s curiosity!
The natural sweetness of her disposition had saved her from becoming insolent and ill-humoured; but the caprice which preferred the handsome and insinuating Leicester before Tressilian, of whose high honour and unalterable affection she herself entertained so firm an opinion--that fatal error, which ruined the happiness of her life, had its origin in the mistaken kindness; that had spared her childhood the painful but most necessary lesson of submission and self-command.
It chanced well for the Countess&#39;s purpose that Wayland Smith, whose previous wandering and unsettled life had made him acquainted with almost all England, was intimate with all the byroads, as well as direct communications, through the beautiful county of Warwick.
She is a good Queen, and a generous; she gave the purse to the Earl of Leicester.” “I envious?--beshrew thy heart for the word!” replied the handicraft.
The lordly structure itself, which rose near the centre of this spacious enclosure, was composed of a huge pile of magnificent castellated buildings, apparently of different ages, surrounding an inner court, and bearing in the names attached to each portion of the magnificent mass, and in the armorial bearings which were there blazoned, the emblems of mighty chiefs who had long passed away, and whose history, could Ambition have lent ear to it, might have read a lesson to the haughty favourite who had now acquired and was augmenting the fair domain.
And, indeed, when the lady obtained the first commanding view of the Castle, with its stately towers rising from within a long, sweeping line of outward walls, ornamented with battlements and turrets and platforms at every point of defence, with many a banner streaming from its walls, and such a bustle of gay crests and waving plumes disposed on the terraces and battlements, and all the gay and gorgeous scene, her heart, unaccustomed to such splendour, sank as if it died within her, and for a moment she asked herself what she had offered up to Leicester to deserve to become the partner of this princely splendour.
Name and fame, heart and hand, have I given the lord of all this magnificence at the altar, and England&#39;s Queen could give him no more.
Upon the battlements were placed gigantic warders, with clubs, battle-axes, and other implements of ancient warfare, designed to represent the soldiers of King Arthur; those primitive Britons, by whom, according to romantic tradition, the Castle had been first tenanted, though history carried back its antiquity only to the times of the Heptarchy.
He was a man whose huge stature, thews, sinews, and bulk in proportion, would have enabled him to enact Colbrand, Ascapart, or any other giant of romance, without raising himself nearer to heaven even by the altitude of a chopin.
In fine, he represented excellently one of those giants of popular romance, who figure in every fairy tale or legend of knight-errantry.
The porter then gave Dickie a warm caress, and set him on the ground with the same care which a careful housewife uses in replacing a cracked china cup upon her mantelpiece, calling out at the same time to Wayland and the lady, “In with you--in with you!
They entered accordingly, in silence, the great outward court of the Castle, having then full before them that vast and lordly pile, with all its stately towers, each gate open, as if in sign of unlimited hospitality, and the apartments filled with noble guests of every degree, besides dependants, retainers, domestics of every description, and all the appendages and promoters of mirth and revelry.
I may indeed claim right to command, but who is there will obey me!” Then suddenly raising her head, like one who has formed a decisive resolution, she addressed a gaily-dressed domestic, who was crossing the court with importance and bustle in his countenance, “Stop, sir,” she said; “I desire to speak with, the Earl of Leicester.” “With whom, an it please you?” said the man, surprised at the demand; and then looking upon the mean equipage of her who used towards him such a tone of authority, he added, with insolence, “Why, what Bess of Bedlam is this would ask to see my lord on such a day as the present?” “Friend,” said the Countess, “be not insolent--my business with the Earl is most urgent.” “You must get some one else to do it, were it thrice as urgent,” said the fellow.
They entered the inner court of the Castle by the great gateway, which extended betwixt the principal Keep, or Donjon, called Caesar&#39;s Tower, and a stately building which passed by the name of King Henry&#39;s Lodging, and were thus placed in the centre of the noble pile, which presented on its different fronts magnificent specimens of every species of castellated architecture, from the Conquest to the reign of Elizabeth, with the appropriate style and ornaments of each.
Across this inner court also they were conducted by their guide to a small but strong tower, occupying the north-east angle of the building, adjacent to the great hall, and filling up a space betwixt the immense range of kitchens and the end of the great hall itself.
It frequently sinks so deep into the mind that it becomes their dream by night and their vision by day--mixes itself with every source of interest and enjoyment; and when blighted and withered by final disappointment, it seems as if the springs of the heart were dried up along with it.
This aching of the heart, this languishing after a shadow which has lost all the gaiety of its colouring, this dwelling on the remembrance of a dream from which we have been long roughly awakened, is the weakness of a gentle and generous heart, and it was that of Tressilian.
“Tressilian,” she said, at length, “why come you here?” “Nay, why come you here, Amy,” returned Tressilian, “unless it be at length to claim that aid, which, as far as one man&#39;s heart and arm can extend, shall instantly be rendered to you?” She was silent a moment, and then answered in a sorrowful rather than an angry tone, “I require no aid, Tressilian, and would rather be injured than benefited by any which your kindness can offer me.
Believe me, I am near one whom law and love oblige to protect me.” “The villain, then, hath done you the poor justice which remained in his power,” said Tressilian, “and I behold before me the wife of Varney!” “The wife of Varney!” she replied, with all the emphasis of scorn.
It would have been a betrayal of the secret, on which her husband had assured her that his fortunes depended, to Tressilian, to Sussex, to the Queen, and to the whole assembled court.
Grant me one request, and believe, if it be your wish to save me from misery and from madness, you will do more by making me the promise I ask of you, than Elizabeth can do for me with all her power.” “Ask me anything for which you can allege reason,” said Tressilian; “but demand not of me--” “Oh, limit not your boon, dear Edmund!” exclaimed the Countess--“you once loved that I should call you so--limit not your boon to reason; for my case is all madness, and frenzy must guide the counsels which alone can aid me.” “If you speak thus wildly,” said Tressilian, astonishment again overpowering both his grief and his resolution, “I must believe you indeed incapable of thinking or acting for yourself.” “Oh, no!” she exclaimed, sinking on one knee before him, “I am not mad--I am but a creature unutterably miserable, and, from circumstances the most singular, dragged on to a precipice by the arm of him who thinks he is keeping me from it--even by yours, Tressilian--by yours, whom I have honoured, respected--all but loved--and yet loved, too--loved, too, Tressilian--though not as you wished to be.” There was an energy, a self-possession, an abandonment in her voice and manner, a total resignation of herself to his generosity, which, together with the kindness of her expressions to himself, moved him deeply.
He stopped Tressilian upon the staircase without the least bashfulness or embarrassment, and addressed him as if he had been on kind and intimate terms:--“What, no grudge between us, I hope, upon old scores, Master Tressilian?--nay, I am one who remembers former kindness rather than latter feud.
You would take Master Tressilian now for the most maid-like, modest, simpering squire of dames that ever made love when candles were long i&#39; the stuff--snuff; call you it?
In one respect, he had gained much towards securing effectual protection for this unhappy and still beloved object of his early affection.
Perhaps she may remember the ring she offered me--it was well earned, I trow; but she is a lovely creature, and--marry hang the ring!
So now for the lady, and then for the road.” With the stealthy step and jealous eye of the cat that steals on her prey, Wayland resumed the way to the Countess&#39;s chamber, sliding along by the side of the courts and passages, alike observant of all around him, and studious himself to escape observation.
Body o&#39; me, what crackings and clashings, what groanings and what howlings, will there be at such times in Mervyn&#39;s Bower, right as it were over our heads, till the matter of two quarts of distilled waters has not been enough to keep my lads and me in some heart!” “Pshaw, man!” replied Lambourne, on whom his last draught, joined to repeated visitations of the pitcher upon former occasions, began to make some innovation, “thou speakest thou knowest not what about spirits.
Huzza for Queen Elizabeth!--for the noble Leicester!--for the worshipful Master Varney!--and for Michael Lambourne, that can turn them all round his finger!” So saying, he walked downstairs, and across the inner court.
Tressilian had no great desire for their society in the present state of his feelings, but there was no possibility of avoiding them; and indeed he felt that, bound by his promise not to approach Amy, or take any step in her behalf, it would be his best course at once to mix with general society, and to exhibit on his brow as little as he could of the anguish and uncertainty which sat heavy at his heart.
Whence come ye?” “From Warwick, to be sure,” said Blount; “we must needs home to change our habits, like poor players, who are fain to multiply their persons to outward appearance by change of suits; and you had better do the like, Tressilian.” “Blount is right,” said Raleigh; “the Queen loves such marks of deference, and notices, as wanting in respect, those who, not arriving in her immediate attendance, may appear in their soiled and ruffled riding-dress.
But look at Blount himself, Tressilian, for the love of laughter, and see how his villainous tailor hath apparelled him--in blue, green, and crimson, with carnation ribbons, and yellow roses in his shoes!” “Why, what wouldst thou have?” said Blount.
“Judge betwixt us, Tressilian, for the love of heaven!” Tressilian, thus appealed to, looked at them both, and was immediately sensible at a single glance that honest Blount had taken upon the tailor&#39;s warrant the pied garments which he had chosen to make, and was as much embarrassed by the quantity of points and ribbons which garnished his dress, as a clown is in his holiday clothes; while the dress of Raleigh was a well-fancied and rich suit, which the wearer bore as a garb too well adapted to his elegant person to attract particular attention.
A profuse distribution of refreshments, together with roasted oxen, and barrels of ale set a-broach in different places of the road, had kept the populace in perfect love and loyalty towards the Queen and her favourite, which might have somewhat abated had fasting been added to watching.
The ladies of the court, who rode beside her Majesty, had taken especial care that their own external appearance should not be more glorious than their rank and the occasion altogether demanded, so that no inferior luminary might appear to approach the orbit of royalty.
What loveliest face, that loving ranks unfold, Like brightest diamond chased in purest gold?
But Lambourne, who had taken upon him the part in the absence of Wayland, being chilled with remaining immersed in an element to which he was not friendly, having never got his speech by heart, and not having, like the porter, the advantage of a prompter, paid it off with impudence, tearing off his vizard, and swearing, “Cogs bones!
Either speak in reason, Giving cold argument the wall of passion, Or I break up the court.
The Earl of Leicester having handed the Queen up to her throne, and seated her there, knelt down before her, and kissing the hand which she held out, with an air in which romantic and respectful gallantry was happily mingled with the air of loyal devotion, he thanked her, in terms of the deepest gratitude, for the highest honour which a sovereign could render to a subject.
So handsome did he look when kneeling before her, that Elizabeth was tempted to prolong the scene a little longer than there was, strictly speaking, necessity for; and ere she raised him, she passed her hand over his head, so near as almost to touch his long, curled, and perfumed hair, and with a movement of fondness that seemed to intimate she would, if she dared, have made the motion a slight caress.
[To justify what may be considered as a high-coloured picture, the author quotes the original of the courtly and shrewd Sir James Melville, being then Queen Mary&#39;s envoy at the court of London.
For ourselves, we will receive your courtesies this evening but clownishly, since it is not our purpose to change our riding attire, being in effect something fatigued with a journey which the concourse of our good people hath rendered slow, though the love they have shown our person hath, at the same time, made it delightful.” Leicester, having received this permission, retired accordingly, and was followed by those nobles who had attended the Queen to Kenilworth in person.
“Oh, the Menelaus of our romance.
“Here,” said he, “are attestations from a most learned physician, whose skill and honour are well known to my good Lord of Leicester, and from an honest and devout Protestant, a man of credit and substance, one Anthony Foster, the gentleman in whose house she is at present bestowed, that she now labours under an illness which altogether unfits her for such a journey as betwixt this Castle and the neighbourhood of Oxford.” “This alters the matter,” said the Queen, taking the certificates in her hand, and glancing at their contents.--“Let Tressilian come forward.--Master Tressilian, we have much sympathy for your situation, the rather that you seem to have set your heart deeply on this Amy Robsart, or Varney.
Our power, thanks to God, and the willing obedience of a loving people, is worth much, but there are some things which it cannot compass.
We cannot, for example, command the affections of a giddy young girl, or make her love sense and learning better than a courtier&#39;s fine doublet; and we cannot control sickness, with which it seems this lady is afflicted, who may not, by reason of such infirmity, attend our court here, as we had required her to do.
You have done your duty something more than boldly; but we were no woman had we not compassion for the wounds which true love deals, so we forgive your audacity, and your uncleansed boots withal, which have well-nigh overpowered my Lord of Leicester&#39;s perfumes.” So spoke Elizabeth, whose nicety of scent was one of the characteristics of her organization, as appeared long afterwards when she expelled Essex from her presence, on a charge against his boots similar to that which she now expressed against those of Tressilian.
And we render Varney the honour more especially that we are a guest, and, we fear, a chargeable and troublesome one, under your lordship&#39;s roof; and also for the satisfaction of the good old Knight of Devon, Sir Hugh Robsart, whose daughter he hath married, and we trust the especial mark of grace which we are about to confer may reconcile him to his son-in-law.--Your sword, my Lord of Leicester.” The Earl unbuckled his sword, and taking it by the point, presented on bended knee the hilt to Elizabeth.
“Had I been a man,” she said, “methinks none of my ancestors would have loved a good sword better.
“But we will have this same Sir Nicholas sent to Ireland or Scotland, or somewhere, to rid our court of so antic a chevalier; he may be a good soldier in the field, though a preposterous ass in a banqueting-hall.” The discourse became then more general, and soon after there was a summons to the banquet.
In order to obey this signal, the company were under the necessity of crossing the inner court of the Castle, that they might reach the new buildings containing the large banqueting-room, in which preparations for supper were made upon a scale of profuse magnificence, corresponding to the occasion.
Varney took a seat near the bed, but with his back towards his master, as if to intimate that he was not watching him, and quietly waited till Leicester himself led the way to the topic by which his mind was engrossed.
Thou wouldst intimate I might marry the Queen if I would?” “It is your speech, my lord, not mine,” answered Varney; “but whosesoever be the speech, it is the thought of ninety-nine out of an hundred men throughout broad England.” “Ay, but,” said Leicester, turning himself in his bed, “the hundredth man knows better.
I said but that the Countess was ill. And Countess though she be--lovely and beloved as she is--surely your lordship must hold her to be mortal?
Confess thou hast talked of impossibilities as of things which may come to pass.” “My lord, long live your fair Countess,” said Varney; “but neither your love nor my good wishes can make her immortal.
“Have we not known in other countries how a left-handed marriage might subsist betwixt persons of differing degree?--ay, and be no hindrance to prevent the husband from conjoining himself afterwards with a more suitable partner?” “I have heard of such things in Germany,” said Leicester.
The beautiful partner whom you have chosen for true love has your secret hours of relaxation and affection.
Meanwhile you may give to Elizabeth ten times the leisure, and ten thousand times the affection, that ever Don Philip of Spain spared to her sister Mary; yet you know how she doted on him though so cold and neglectful.
Can you guess what meant Tressilian by showing himself in such careless guise before the Queen to-day?--to strike her tender heart, I should guess, with all the sympathies due to a lover abandoned by his mistress and abandoning himself.” Varney, smothering a sneering laugh, answered, “He believed Master Tressilian had no such matter in his head.” “How!” said Leicester; “what meanest thou?
after all--all that thou hast said--hast sworn--that Amy was thy love, thy life, can it be that thou art the magician at whose nod these enchantments arise, and that she sees them as an outcast, if not a captive?” The sustained, prolonged, and repeated bursts of music, from so many different quarters, and at so many varying points of distance, which sounded as if not the Castle of Kenilworth only, but the whole country around, had been at once the scene of solemnizing some high national festival, carried the same oppressive thought still closer to her heart, while some notes would melt in distant and falling tones, as if in compassion for her sorrows, and some burst close and near upon her, as if mocking her misery, with all the insolence of unlimited mirth.
Having taken these necessary precautions, the unfortunate lady withdrew to her couch, stretched herself down on it, mused in anxious expectation, and counted more than one hour after midnight, till exhausted nature proved too strong for love, for grief, for fear, nay, even for uncertainty, and she slept.
“Is it thou, my love?” “Yes, my Countess,” murmured a whisper in reply.
“No--not quite Leicester,” answered Michael Lambourne, for he it was, returning the caress with vehemence--“not quite Leicester, my lovely and most loving duchess, but as good a man.” With an exertion of force, of which she would at another time have thought herself incapable, the Countess freed herself from the profane and profaning grasp of the drunken debauchee, and retreated into the midst of her apartment where despair gave her courage to make a stand.
But she was still closely muffled in her travelling dress, and as Lambourne had scarce ever been admitted to her presence at Cumnor Place, her person, she hoped, might not be so well known to him as his was to her, owing to Janet&#39;s pointing him frequently out as he crossed the court, and telling stories of his wickedness.
I love thy first frank manner the best--like thy present as little”--(he made a step towards her, and staggered)--“as little as--such a damned uneven floor as this, where a gentleman may break his neck if he does not walk as upright as a posture-master on the tight-rope.” “Stand back!” said the Countess; “do not approach nearer to me on thy peril!” “My peril!--and stand back!

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I love my prisoners; and I have had as good prisoners under my key as they have had in Newgate or the Compter.
He is stirring, I promise you; I saw him cross the court just now.” “Didst thou, by G--!” said Lambourne, seizing on the basin and ewer which stood in the apartment.
I will wait, I will watch; amidst so many human beings there must be some kind heart which can judge and compassionate what mine endures.” In truth, more than one party entered and traversed the Pleasance.
But they were in joyous groups of four or five persons together, laughing and jesting in their own fullness of mirth and lightness of heart.
It was but stepping back to the farthest recess of a grotto, ornamented with rustic work and moss-seats, and terminated by a fountain, and she might easily remain concealed, or at her pleasure discover herself to any solitary wanderer whose curiosity might lead him to that romantic retirement.
She cuddles close beneath the brake, Afraid to sit, afraid to fly, --PRIOR.
Leicester&#39;s hunting suit of Lincoln green, richly embroidered with gold, and crossed by the gay baldric which sustained a bugle-horn, and a wood-knife instead of a sword, became its master, as did his other vestments of court or of war.
But those who watched at some distance (and the eyes of courtiers and court ladies are right sharp) were of opinion that on no occasion did the dignity of Elizabeth, in gesture and motion, seem so decidedly to soften away into a mien expressive of indecision and tenderness.
Gallantry becomes mingled with conversation, and affection and passion come gradually to mix with gallantry.
The Queen, an accomplished and handsome woman, the pride of England, the hope of France and Holland, and the dread of Spain, had probably listened with more than usual favour to that mixture of romantic gallantry with which she always loved to be addressed; and the Earl had, in vanity, in ambition, or in both, thrown in more and more of that delicious ingredient, until his importunity became the language of love itself.
Thou didst deceive thine old and honoured father--thy look confesses it--cheated Master Tressilian--thy blush avouches it--and married this same Varney.” Amy sprung on her feet, and interrupted the Queen eagerly with, “No, madam, no!
He had already raised his head with the dignity of a man of honour to avow his marriage, and proclaim himself the protector of his Countess, when Varney, born, as it appeared, to be his master&#39;s evil genius, rushed into the presence with every mark of disorder on his face and apparel.
Varney, with the air of a man altogether overwhelmed with grief and confusion, prostrated himself before her feet, exclaiming, “Pardon, my Liege, pardon!--or at least let your justice avenge itself on me, where it is due; but spare my noble, my generous, my innocent patron and master!” Amy, who was yet kneeling, started up as she saw the man whom she deemed most odious place himself so near her, and was about to fly towards Leicester, when, checked at once by the uncertainty and even timidity which his looks had reassumed as soon as the appearance of his confidant seemed to open a new scene, she hung back, and uttering a faint scream, besought of her Majesty to cause her to be imprisoned in the lowest dungeon of the Castle--to deal with her as the worst of criminals--“but spare,” she exclaimed, “my sight and hearing what will destroy the little judgment I have left--the sight of that unutterable and most shameless villain!” “And why, sweetheart?” said the Queen, moved by a new impulse; “what hath he, this false knight, since such thou accountest him, done to thee?” “Oh, worse than sorrow, madam, and worse than injury--he has sown dissension where most there should be peace.
“Your Majesty&#39;s piercing eye,” he said, “has already detected the cruel malady of my beloved lady, which, unhappy that I am, I would not suffer to be expressed in the certificate of her physician, seeking to conceal what has now broken out with so much the more scandal.” “She is then distraught?” said the Queen.
You shall have license, however, to see her, that if there be any matrimonial quarrel betwixt you--such things we have heard do occur, even betwixt a loving couple--you may make it up, without further scandal to our court or trouble to ourselves.” Varney bowed low, and made no other answer.
Elizabeth again looked towards Leicester, and said, with a degree of condescension which could only arise out of the most heartfelt interest, “Discord, as the Italian poet says, will find her way into peaceful convents, as well as into the privacy of families; and we fear our own guards and ushers will hardly exclude her from courts.
He could scarce have missed shipwreck, knowing as he does so little how to trim his sails to a court gale.” “Thou wouldst have instructed him!” said Raleigh.
“I have this morning been both fool and villain; and when Elizabeth hears of my unhappy marriage, she cannot but think herself treated with that premeditated slight which women never forgive.
“Far from it,” replied the Earl; “for, being what she is in spirit and in station, she has even this day been but too condescending, in giving me opportunities to repair what she thinks my faulty heat of temper.” “Ay,” answered Varney; “the Italians say right--in lovers&#39; quarrels, the party that loves most is always most willing to acknowledge the greater fault.
Keep we your marriage from Elizabeth&#39;s knowledge, and all may yet be well.
art thou come to frame some new plan of villainy?” Leicester cut short her reproaches by stepping forward and dropping his cloak, while he said, in a voice rather of authority than of affection, “It is with me, madam, you have to commune, not with Sir Richard Varney.” The change effected on the Countess&#39;s look and manner was like magic.
But what displeasure could keep its ground before these testimonies of affection from a being so lovely, that even the negligence of dress, and the withering effects of fear, grief, and fatigue, which would have impaired the beauty of others, rendered hers but the more interesting.
But thou art come, and all is joy, and health, and safety!” “Alas, Amy,” said Leicester, “thou hast undone me!” “I, my lord?” said Amy, her cheek at once losing its transient flush of joy--“how could I injure that which I love better than myself?” “I would not upbraid you, Amy,” replied the Earl; “but are you not here contrary to my express commands--and does not your presence here endanger both yourself and me?” “Does it, does it indeed?” she exclaimed eagerly; “then why am I here a moment longer?
But it is enough to say that I will not go with him unless by violence, nor would I acknowledge him as my husband were all--” “It is a temporary deception, madam,” said Leicester, irritated by her opposition, “necessary for both our safeties, endangered by you through female caprice, or the premature desire to seize on a rank to which I gave you title only under condition that our marriage, for a time, should continue secret.
She walked up to Leicester with a composed step, a dignified air, and looks in which strong affection essayed in vain to shake the firmness of conscious, truth and rectitude of principle.
Will your lordship be pleased to hear what a young and timid woman, but your most affectionate wife, can suggest in the present extremity?” Leicester was silent, but bent his head towards the Countess, as an intimation that she was at liberty to proceed.
Take your ill-fated wife by the hand, lead her to the footstool of Elizabeth&#39;s throne--say that in a moment of infatuation, moved by supposed beauty, of which none perhaps can now trace even the remains, I gave my hand to this Amy Robsart.
You will then have done justice to me, my lord, and to your own honour and should law or power require you to part from me, I will oppose no objection, since I may then with honour hide a grieved and broken heart in those shades from which your love withdrew me.
“I am not worthy of you, Amy,” he said, “that could weigh aught which ambition has to give against such a heart as thine.
Forgive me, if, in love to you, I see more fully than your noble heart permits you to do, the inextricable difficulties with which you are surrounded.
This is not like other thrones, which can be overturned by a combination of powerful nobles; the broad foundations which support it are in the extended love and affections of the people.
Your marriage is the sole cause of the threatened breach with your Sovereign, my lord, is it not?” “Thou knowest it is!” replied Leicester.
You know the eagerness with which he has pressed on the suit against me in behalf of this lady, the open object of which is to drive your lordship to an avowal of what I must ever call your most unhappy marriage, the point to which my lady also is willing, at any risk, to urge you.” Leicester smiled constrainedly.
Your lordship knows with what unwilling ears we listen to evil surmises against those whom we love; and I thank Heaven I am no makebate or informer, to be the first to sow them.” “You are but too ready to receive them, however, Sir Richard,” replied his patron.
I see her infamy-I can see nought else; and--gracious Heaven!--for this vile woman was I about to commit to danger the lives of so many noble friends, shake the foundation of a lawful throne, carry the sword and torch through the bosom of a peaceful land, wrong the kind mistress who made me what I am, and would, but for that hell-framed marriage, have made me all that man can be!
Prove her so, and all I have yet done for thee shall be as nothing--nothing, in comparison of thy recompense!” The agony with which his master spoke had some effect even on the hardened Varney, who, in the midst of his own wicked and ambitious designs, really loved his patron as well as such a wretch was capable of loving anything.
But he comforted himself, and subdued his self-reproaches, with the reflection that if he inflicted upon the Earl some immediate and transitory pain, it was in order to pave his way to the throne, which, were this marriage dissolved by death or otherwise, he deemed Elizabeth would willingly share with his benefactor.
“I am sorry for his weakness,” he said, “but love has made him a child.
However habituated his mind usually was to play the part of a good courtier, and appear gay, assiduous, and free from all care but that of enhancing the pleasure of the moment, while his bosom internally throbbed with the pangs of unsatisfied ambition, jealousy, or resentment, his heart had now a yet more dreadful guest, whose workings could not be overshadowed or suppressed; and you might read in his vacant eye and troubled brow that his thoughts were far absent from the scenes in which he was compelling himself to play a part.
Go to Elizabeth&#39;s feet, confess your marriage--impeach your wife and her paramour of adultery--and avow yourself, amongst all your peers, the wittol who married a country girl, and was cozened by her and her book-learned gallant.
Are you the first who has been cozened in love--the first whom a vain and licentious woman has cheated into an affection, which she has afterwards scorned and misused?
Yet resolve at least to choose fitting time and opportunity, and to forbear him until these shall be found.” “Thou shalt order me in what thou wilt,” said Leicester, “only thwart me not in this.” “Then, my lord,” said Varney, “I first request of you to lay aside the wild, suspected, and half-frenzied demeanour which hath this day drawn the eyes of all the court upon you, and which, but for the Queen&#39;s partial indulgence, which she hath extended towards you in a degree far beyond her nature, she had never given you the opportunity to atone for.” “Have I indeed been so negligent?” said Leicester, as one who awakes from a dream.
He was too wary to exchange on a sudden the sullen personage which he had played before he retired with Varney; but on approaching her it seemed softened into a melancholy, which had a touch of tenderness in it, and which, in the course of conversing with Elizabeth, and as she dropped in compassion one mark of favour after another to console him, passed into a flow of affectionate gallantry, the most assiduous, the most delicate, the most insinuating, yet at the same time the most respectful, with which a Queen was ever addressed by a subject.
Her jealousy of power was lulled asleep; her resolution to forsake all social or domestic ties, and dedicate herself exclusively to the care of her people, began to be shaken; and once more the star of Dudley culminated in the court horizon.
And here comes a thing may make us all grave at his pleasure, our learned physician Masters, with news belike of our poor suppliant, Lady Varney;--nay, my lord, we will not have you leave us, for this being a dispute betwixt married persons, we do not hold our own experience deep enough to decide thereon without good counsel.--How now, Masters, what thinkest thou of the runaway bride?” The smile with which Leicester had been speaking, when the Queen interrupted him, remained arrested on his lips, as if it had been carved there by the chisel of Michael Angelo or of Chantrey; and he listened to the speech of the physician with the same immovable cast of countenance.
“The Lady Varney, gracious Sovereign,” said the court physician Masters, “is sullen, and would hold little conference with me touching the state of her health, talking wildly of being soon to plead her own cause before your own presence, and of answering no meaner person&#39;s inquiries.” “Now the heavens forfend!” said the Queen; “we have already suffered from the misconstructions and broils which seem to follow this poor brain-sick lady wherever she comes.--Think you not so, my lord?” she added, appealing to Leicester with something in her look that indicated regret, even tenderly expressed, for their disagreement of that morning.
Ay, men are tyrants, my lord, who esteem the animation of the strife above the triumph of an unresisting conquest, and, like sturdy champions, love best those women who can wage contest with them.--I could think with you, Rutland, that give my Lord of Leicester such a piece of painted wax for a bride, he would have wished her dead ere the end of the honeymoon.” As she said this, she looked on Leicester so expressively that, while his heart revolted against the egregious falsehood, he did himself so much violence as to reply in a whisper that Leicester&#39;s love was more lowly than her Majesty deemed, since it was settled where he could never command, but must ever obey.
The aboriginal Britons had been selected from amongst the tallest and most robust young gentlemen in attendance on the court.
Last came the knightly Normans, in their mail-shirts and hoods of steel, with all the panoply of chivalry, and marshalled by two Minstrels, who sang of war and ladies&#39; love.
Thus,” she said, “the Englishman had from the ancient Briton his bold and tameless spirit of freedom; from the Roman his disciplined courage in war, with his love of letters and civilization in time of peace; from the Saxon his wise and equitable laws; and from the chivalrous Norman his love of honour and courtesy, with his generous desire for glory.” Merlin answered with readiness that it did indeed require that so many choice qualities should meet in the English, as might render them in some measure the muster of the perfections of other nations, since that alone could render them in some degree deserving of the blessings they enjoyed under the reign of England&#39;s Elizabeth.
The space is passed,--I now speak, and do your lordship the justice to address myself first to you.” The thrill of astonishment which had penetrated to Leicester&#39;s very heart at hearing that name pronounced by the voice of the man he most detested, and by whom he conceived himself so deeply injured, at first rendered him immovable, but instantly gave way to such a thirst for revenge as the pilgrim in the desert feels for the water-brooks.
He had but sense and self-government enough left to prevent his stabbing to the heart the audacious villain, who, after the ruin he had brought upon him, dared, with such unmoved assurance, thus to practise upon him further.
But could the bosom of him thus admired and envied have been laid open before the inhabitants of that crowded hall, with all its dark thoughts of guilty ambition, blighted affection, deep vengeance, and conscious sense of meditated cruelty, crossing each other like spectres in the circle of some foul enchantress, which of them, from the most ambitious noble in the courtly circle down to the most wretched menial who lived by shifting of trenchers, would have desired to change characters with the favourite of Elizabeth, and the Lord of Kenilworth?
Certes, we have no will to withhold him from the affectionate charge of this poor young person; but you are to know that Sir Richard Varney hath this day shown himself so much captivated with these ladies of ours, that here is our Duchess of Rutland says he will carry his poor insane wife no farther than the lake, plunge her in to tenant the crystal palaces that the enchanted nymph told us of, and return a jolly widower, to dry his tears and to make up the loss among our train.
He loves me, I think; but he hath his own ends to serve, and he is inexorable in pursuit of them.
I am a friend, but neither a dependant nor partisan, of the Earl of Sussex, whom courtiers call your rival; and it is some considerable time since I ceased to consider either courts or court intrigues as suited to my temper or genius.” “No doubt, sir,” answered Leicester “there are other occupations more worthy a scholar, and for such the world holds Master Tressilian.
This must be reformed, my lord--I speak it as authorized by her father--and this ill-fated marriage must be avouched and proved in the Queen&#39;s presence, and the lady placed without restraint and at her own free disposal.
And permit me to say it concerns no one&#39;s honour that these most just demands of mine should be complied with so much as it does that of your lordship.” The Earl stood as if he had been petrified at the extreme coolness with which the man, whom he considered as having injured him so deeply, pleaded the cause of his criminal paramour, as if she had been an innocent woman and he a disinterested advocate; nor was his wonder lessened by the warmth with which Tressilian seemed to demand for her the rank and situation which she had disgraced, and the advantages of which she was doubtless to share with the lover who advocated her cause with such effrontery.
He conducted Tressilian to Mervyn&#39;s Tower, in which he was now again lodged; and then, ere parting with him, said these words, “If thou hast courage to continue and bring to an end what is thus broken off, be near me when the court goes forth to-morrow; we shall find a time, and I will give you a signal when it is fitting.” “My lord,” said Tressilian, “at another time I might have inquired the meaning of this strange and furious inveteracy against me.
And now there is a brawl down in the Pleasance, or what call you the stone terrace-walk where all yonder gimcracks stand?” The first part of the old man&#39;s speech went through the Earl&#39;s heart like a knife; to the last he answered that he himself had heard the clash of swords, and had come down to take order with those who had been so insolent so near the Queen&#39;s presence.
The amusement with which Elizabeth and her court were next day to be regaled was an exhibition by the true-hearted men of Coventry, who were to represent the strife between the English and the Danes, agreeably to a custom long preserved in their ancient borough, and warranted for truth by old histories and chronicles.
Accordingly, after a morning repast, which Master Laneham calls an ambrosial breakfast, the principal persons of the court in attendance upon her Majesty pressed to the Gallery-tower, to witness the approach of the two contending parties of English and Danes; and after a signal had been given, the gate which opened in the circuit of the Chase was thrown wide to admit them.
This chieftain was, as right and reason craved, the first to enter the lists, and passing the Gallery at the head of his myrmidons, kissed the hilt of his sword to the Queen, and executed at the same time a gambade, the like whereof had never been practised by two-legged hobby-horse.
These rough, rural gambols may not altogether agree with the reader&#39;s preconceived idea of an entertainment presented before Elizabeth, in whose reign letters revived with such brilliancy, and whose court, governed by a female whose sense of propriety was equal to her strength of mind, was no less distinguished for delicacy and refinement than her councils for wisdom and fortitude.
The disposition which the Queen showed to laugh and jest with her military leaders gave the Earl of Leicester the opportunity he had been watching for withdrawing from the royal presence, which to the court around, so well had he chosen his time, had the graceful appearance of leaving his rival free access to the Queen&#39;s person, instead of availing himself of his right as her landlord to stand perpetually betwixt others and the light of her countenance.
“Take my sword,” he said, “Tressilian, and pierce my heart, as I would but now have pierced yours!” “My lord,” said Tressilian, “you have done me great wrong, but something within my breast ever whispered that it was by egregious error.” “Error, indeed!” said Leicester, and handed him the letter; “I have been made to believe a man of honour a villain, and the best and purest of creatures a false profligate.--Wretched boy, why comes this letter now, and where has the bearer lingered?” “I dare not tell you, my lord,” said the boy, withdrawing, as if to keep beyond his reach; “but here comes one who was the messenger.” Wayland at the same moment came up; and interrogated by Leicester, hastily detailed all the circumstances of his escape with Amy, the fatal practices which had driven her to flight, and her anxious desire to throw herself under the instant protection of her husband--pointing out the evidence of the domestics of Kenilworth, “who could not,” he observed, “but remember her eager inquiries after the Earl of Leicester on her first arrival.” “The villains!” exclaimed Leicester; “but oh, that worst of villains, Varney!--and she is even now in his power!” “But not, I trust in God,” said Tressilian, “with any commands of fatal import?” “No, no, no!” exclaimed the Earl hastily.
Sir Nicholas Blount was the first person of his own particular acquaintance Tressilian saw, who left him no time to make inquiries, but greeted him with, “God help thy heart, Tressilian!
I could excuse the one, for I love a good horse naturally; but to be plagued with a bratchet whelp.--Whence come ye, my fair-favoured little gossip?” “From the Fens,” answered the boy.
Upon entrance, Tressilian found himself, not without a strong palpitation of heart, in the presence of Elizabeth, who was walking to and fro in a violent agitation, which she seemed to scorn to conceal, while two or three of her most sage and confidential counsellors exchanged anxious looks with each other, but delayed speaking till her wrath abated.
“Burleigh,” she said, “thou art a statesman--thou dost not, thou canst not, comprehend half the scorn, half the misery, that man has poured on me!” With the utmost caution--with the deepest reverence--Burleigh took her hand at the moment he saw her heart was at the fullest, and led her aside to an oriel window, apart from the others.
to think on it is distraction!” “Be but yourself, my Queen,” said Burleigh; “and soar far above a weakness which no Englishman will ever believe his Elizabeth could have entertained, unless the violence of her disappointment carries a sad conviction to his bosom.” “What weakness, my lord?” said Elizabeth haughtily; “would you too insinuate that the favour in which I held yonder proud traitor derived its source from aught--” But here she could no longer sustain the proud tone which she had assumed, and again softened as she said, “But why should I strive to deceive even thee, my good and wise servant?” Burleigh stooped to kiss her hand with affection, and--rare in the annals of courts--a tear of true sympathy dropped from the eye of the minister on the hand of his Sovereign.
Yet, having given your word to this unhappy lady, it was the part of a man and a gentleman to keep it; and on the whole, we esteem you for the character you have sustained in this matter.--My Lord of Leicester, it is now your turn to tell us the truth, an exercise to which you seem of late to have been too much a stranger.” Accordingly, she extorted, by successive questions, the whole history of his first acquaintance with Amy Robsart--their marriage--his jealousy--the causes on which it was founded, and many particulars besides.
Yet the consciousness of this was what at that moment lay nearest to his heart; and although he trusted in great measure to the very positive counter-orders which he had sent by Lambourne, it was his purpose to set out for Cumnor Place in person as soon as he should be dismissed from the presence of the Queen, who, he concluded, would presently leave Kenilworth.
But barred from every other and more direct mode of revenge, the Queen perceived that she gave her false suitor torture by these inquiries, and dwelt on them for that reason, no more regarding the pain which she herself experienced, than the savage cares for the searing of his own hands by grasping the hot pincers with which he tears the flesh of his captive enemy.
Yet, madam, let me say that my guilt, if it be unpardonable, was not unprovoked, and that if beauty and condescending dignity could seduce the frail heart of a human being, I might plead both as the causes of my concealing this secret from your Majesty.” The Queen was so much struck with this reply, which Leicester took care should be heard by no one but herself, that she was for the moment silenced, and the Earl had the temerity to pursue his advantage.
my lords, come all and hear the news-my Lord of Leicester&#39;s stolen marriage has cost me a husband, and England a king.
Sussex, from his natural military frankness of disposition, Burleigh and Walsingham, from their penetrating and prospective sagacity, and some of the ladies, from the compassion of their sex, were the only persons in the crowded court who retained towards him the countenance they had borne in the morning.
So much had Leicester been accustomed to consider court favour as the principal object of his life, that all other sensations were, for the time, lost in the agony which his haughty spirit felt at the succession of petty insults and studied neglects to which he had been subjected; but when he retired to his own chamber for the night, that long, fair tress of hair which had once secured Amy&#39;s letter fell under his observation, and, with the influence of a counter-charm, awakened his heart to nobler and more natural feelings.
He kissed it a thousand times; and while he recollected that he had it always in his power to shun the mortifications which he had that day undergone, by retiring into a dignified and even prince-like seclusion with the beautiful and beloved partner of his future life, he felt that he could rise above the revenge which Elizabeth had condescended to take.
He resumed his speech to Lambourne: “And will you turn upon your master, who has introduced you to this career of court-like favour--whose apprentice you have been, Michael--who has taught you the depths and shallows of court intrigue?” “Michael not me!” said Lambourne; “I have a name will brook a MASTER before it as well as another; and as to the rest, if I have been an apprentice, my indenture is out, and I am resolute to set up for myself.” “Take thy quittance first, thou fool!” said Varney; and with a pistol, which he had for some time held in his hand, shot Lambourne through the body.
God help me, I have no gold--I would I had!” “Now, marry hang thee, thou stupid brute, who thinks of or cares for thy gold?
I trust,” she said apprehensively, “I may secure it on the inside?” “With all my heart,” answered Foster, “so I may secure it on the outside;” and taking a light, he led the way to a part of the building where Amy had never been, and conducted her up a stair of great height, preceded by one of the old women with a lamp.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Yonder trap-door--yonder gimcrack of thine, will remain secure in appearance, will it not, though the supports are withdrawn beneath?” “Ay, marry, will it,” said Foster; “so long as it is not trodden on.” “But were the lady to attempt an escape over it,” replied Varney, “her weight would carry it down?” “A mouse&#39;s weight would do it,” said Foster.
The despairing grief of Tressilian, on viewing the mangled and yet warm remains of what had lately been so lovely and so beloved, was such that Raleigh was compelled to have him removed from the place by force, while he himself assumed the direction of what was to be done.
Leicester retired from court, and for a considerable time abandoned himself to his remorse.
The Queen at length recalled him to court; he was once more distinguished as a statesman and favourite; and the rest of his career is well known to history.
But neither the prospect of rural independence, nor the promises of favour which Elizabeth held out to induce him to follow the court, could remove his profound melancholy.
Wherever he went he seemed to see before him the disfigured corpse of the early and only object of his affection.
Of inferior persons it is only necessary to say that Blount&#39;s wit grew brighter as his yellow roses faded; that, doing his part as a brave commander in the wars, he was much more in his element than during the short period of his following the court; and that Flibbertigibbet&#39;s acute genius raised him to favour and distinction in the employment both of Burleigh and Walsingham.
In so far, therefore, the Anthony Foster of the romance has nothing but the name in common with the real individual.
The name of Lambourne is still known in the vicinity, and it is said some of the clan partake the habits, as well as name, of the Michael Lambourne of the romance.
Among the attendants and adherents of Sussex, we have ventured to introduce the celebrated Raleigh, in the dawn of his court favour.
The gallant incident of the cloak is the traditional account of this celebrated statesman&#39;s rise at court.
None of Elizabeth&#39;s courtiers knew better than he how to make his court to her personal vanity, or could more justly estimate the quantity of flattery which she could condescend to swallow.
There is a curious passage on the subject:-- “Long after this, he fell in love with the Lady Sheffield, whom I signified before, and then also had he the same fortune to have her husband dye quickly, with an extreame rheume in his head (as it was given out), but as others say, of an artificiall catarre that stopped his breath.
Here lies a valiant warriour, Who never drew a sword; Here lies a noble courtier, Who never kept his word; Here lies the Erle of Leister, Who governed the Estates, Whom the earth could never living love, And the just Heaven now hates.

confidence

And then it seemed to him that this was a needless assumption, for the prospect was quite beautiful enough to be looked at for itself, and there was nothing impossible in a pretty girl having a love of fine landscape.
This consisted of a letter from an intimate friend who was living in Germany--a friend whose name was Gordon Wright.
I am making love.
I have been making love ever since the last of May.
Every phrase in his letter seemed, to Bernard, to march in stout-soled walking-boots, and nothing could better express his attachment to the process of reasoning things out than this proposal that his friend should come and make a chemical analysis--a geometrical survey--of the lady of his love.
Yet for the man on whose character he so freely exercised his wit Bernard Longueville had a strong affection.
It was because he regarded him in so plain and direct a fashion, that Bernard had an affection for his friend--an affection to which it would perhaps be difficult to assign a definite cause.
Longueville had a relish for fine quality--superior savour; and he was sensible of this merit in the simple, candid, manly, affectionate nature of his comrade, which seemed to him an excellent thing of its kind.
Gordon Wright had a tender heart and a strong will--a combination which, when the understanding is not too limited, is often the motive of admirable actions.
Longueville, remembering that Gordon had written to him that he had been &quot;making love,&quot; began to seek in his countenance for the ravages of passion.
Was that pretty girl at his side the ambiguous object of his adoration, and, in that case, what was the function of the elder lady, and what had become of her argumentative daughter?
It surely could not be with regard to this transparent little flirt that Gordon Wright desired advice; you could literally see the daylight--or rather the Baden gaslight--on the other side of her.
Did n&#39;t you write to me that you had been making violent love?&quot;
&quot;I want very much to marry.&quot;
Seriously, solemnly, then, it is one of these young ladies that has put marriage into your head?&quot;
&quot;Having a desire to marry, you proceeded to fall in love.&quot;
&quot;I am not in love!&quot;
&quot;My dear Gordon, it &#39;s no use; you are in love.&quot;
&quot;I want to marry with my eyes open.
You don&#39;t know people when you are in love with them.
&quot;Well, as I say, I want to know the woman I marry, as I should know any one else.
Your passionate heart contradicts your frigid intellect.
I repeat it--you are in love.&quot;
&quot;That proves you are in love.
One can&#39;t be in love with two women at once, but one may perfectly have two of them--or as many as you please--up for a competitive examination.
&quot;My dear Gordon, you are very much in love!&quot;
Had you become very intimate with your friends in Dresden?&quot;
Was she in love with Gordon Wright, and did she wish, in consequence, to forget--and wish him not to suspect--that she had ever received an expression of admiration from another man?
As for her being in love with Gordon Wright, that of course was another affair, and Bernard did not pretend, as yet, to have an opinion on this point, beyond hoping very much that she might be.
&quot;He is completely fascinated--he is very much in love with her.&quot;
He had not been making violent love, as he told Longueville, and these demonstrations were certainly not violent.
There was nothing in her deportment to indicate that she was in love with her systematic suitor.
When a man &#39;s in love, what need he care what other people think of the loved object?&quot;
But there is some excuse for him in the loved object being, as you say, complicated.&quot;
The loved object is always complicated.&quot;
&quot;My heart was very much set upon it.
I was very hard hit--I was deeply smitten.
&quot;Oh, any one can see, of course,&quot; said Captain Lovelock, &quot;that Mr. Gordon Wright is dying of love for Miss Vivian.&quot;
&quot;At any rate, Angela is not dying of love for Mr.
&quot;Well, she will marry him all the same,&quot; Lovelock declared.
&quot;She won&#39;t marry him.&quot;
&quot;She would n&#39;t let you marry me,&quot; said Lovelock.
Captain Lovelock had been struck with the fact that she favored Gordon Wright&#39;s addresses to her daughter, and Captain Lovelock had a grotesque theory that she had set her heart upon seeing this young lady come into six thousand a year.
Whether or no Miss Vivian were in love with Gordon Wright, her mother was enamored of Gordon&#39;s fortune, and it had suddenly occurred to her that instead of treating the friend of her daughter&#39;s suitor with civil mistrust, she would help her case better by giving him a hint of her state of mind and appealing to his sense of propriety.
Nothing could be more natural than that Mrs. Vivian should suppose that Bernard desired his friend&#39;s success; for, as our thoughtful hero said to himself, what she had hitherto taken it into her head to fear was not that Bernard should fall in love with her daughter, but that her daughter should fall in love with him.
&quot;Well, that she might flirt, for instance.&quot;
Gordon is a charming fellow, but he is by no means the only attraction of Baden.
Mrs. Vivian laid her hand upon her daughter&#39;s with a little murmur of tender deprecation, and the girl bent over and kissed her.
His position at moments seemed to him an odious one, for he was firmly resolved that between him and the woman to whom his friend had proposed there should be nothing in the way of a vulgar flirtation.
Under the circumstances, it savoured both of flirtation and of vulgarity that they should even fall out with each other--a consummation which appeared to be more or less definitely impending.
Such a result was certainly a remarkable one, for it is almost superfluous to intimate that Miss Vivian was, in fact, perpetually in his thoughts.
After this, of her own movement, she never spoke of Gordon, and Bernard made up his mind that she had promised her mother to accept him if he should repeat his proposal, and that as her heart was not in the matter she preferred to drop a veil over the prospect.
&quot;She is going to marry him for his money,&quot; he said, &quot;because her mother has brought out the advantages of the thing.
Mrs. Vivian&#39;s persuasive powers have carried the day, and the girl has made herself believe that it does n&#39;t matter that she does n&#39;t love him.
Oh yes, she &#39;s a proud girl, even though she has been able to arrange it with her conscience to make a mercenary marriage.
He flattered himself that he remained so on occasions that were even more insidiously relaxing--when, in the evening, she strolled away with him to parts of the grounds of the Conversation-house, where the music sank to sweeter softness and the murmur of the tree-tops of the Black Forest, stirred by the warm night-air, became almost audible; or when, in the long afternoons, they wandered in the woods apart from the others--from Mrs. Vivian and the amiable object of her more avowed solicitude, the object of the sportive adoration of the irrepressible, the ever-present Lovelock.
The functionary in the red waistcoat was a capital charioteer; he was constantly proposing new drives, and he introduced our little party to treasures of romantic scenery.
&quot;Well,&quot; said Bernard, &quot;I tried to make love to her and she boxed my ears.&quot;
&quot;You tried to make love to her morally?&quot;
&quot;Why did you try to make love to her?&quot;
I don&#39;t believe that you attempted to make love to her.
&quot;Suppose she had let you make love to her,&quot; said Gordon.
&quot;I think she would marry you--but I don&#39;t think she cares for you.&quot;
&quot;The mother and daughter have agreed together to bag you, and Angela, I am sure, has made a vow to be as nice to you after marriage as possible.
&quot;It &#39;s not true, then,&quot; said Gordon, &quot;that you tried to make love to Angela?&quot;
Bernard found it difficult to believe that he had gone there simply to notify her that, having talked it over with an intimate friend, he gave up her daughter, or to mention to the young lady herself that he had ceased to desire the honor of her hand.
He intended to intimate that he had come back to Baden with his mind made up to relinquish his suit, and that he had questioned Bernard simply from moral curiosity--for the sake of intellectual satisfaction.
But if it was more frequent than any pang of conscience connected with the remembrance of Gordon himself, this last sentiment was certainly lively enough to make it a great relief to hear at last a rumor that the excellent fellow was about to be married.
I am going to be married--as soon as possible.
I am very much in love with her, and I hold that an excellent reason.
I have been ready any time this year or two to fall in love with some simple, trusting, child-like nature.
I remember telling you once that I did n&#39;t wish to be fascinated--that I wanted to estimate scientifically the woman I should marry.
We are to be married in a month--try and come back to the wedding.
Bernard, arriving late in the autumn, found his friend a married man of some months&#39; standing, and was able to judge, according to his invitation, whether he appeared happy.
He was delighted that Gordon should be married; he felt jovial about it; he was almost indifferent to the question of whom he had chosen.
Certainly, at first, the choice of Blanche Evers seemed highly incongruous; it was difficult to imagine a young woman less shaped to minister to Gordon&#39;s strenuous needs than the light-hearted and empty-headed little flirt whose inconsequent prattle had remained for Bernard one of the least importunate memories of a charming time.
What a singular selection--what a queer infatuation!
He exclaimed that Blanche Evers was exactly the sort of girl that men of Gordon Wright&#39;s stamp always ended by falling in love with, and that poor Gordon knew very much better what he was about in this case than he had done in trying to solve the deep problem of a comfortable life with Angela Vivian.
Had they been permanently separated by judicious guardians, and had she been obliged to obliterate his image from her lightly-beating little heart?
Gordon had engaged himself to marry, and our critical hero had not a grain of fault to find with this resolution.
The honeymoon had waned, and the business of married life had begun.
The brightness and gayety of the place seemed a greeting to a returning son, and he felt a throb of affection for the freshest, the youngest, the easiest and most good-natured of great capitals.
That evening when you came up and spoke to Gordon, I never thought that three years afterward I should be married to him, and I don&#39;t suppose you did either.
&quot;Nothing particular; it will be a little dull--the perfect happiness of a charming woman married to the best fellow in the world.&quot;
If you say that again you will make me repent of having married the best fellow in the world.
He saw, too--with the fact made more vivid by Gordon&#39;s standing there beside her in his manly sincerity and throwing it into contrast--that Blanche was the same little posturing coquette of a Blanche whom, at Baden, he would have treated it as a broad joke that Gordon Wright should dream of marrying.
It was a curious mania of Gordon&#39;s, this wanting to know what one thought of the women he loved; but Bernard just now felt abundantly able to humor it.
He was so pleased at seeing him tightly married.
&quot;My marriage.&quot;
Since Gordon had determined to marry a little goose, he had chosen the animal with extreme discernment.
She had a scrap of a mind somewhere, and even a little particle of a heart.
Bernard wondered whether she were fond of her husband, and he heard it intimated by several good people in New York who had had some observation of the courtship, that she had married him for his money.
He was disgusted with the idea of such a want of gratitude; for, if Gordon Wright had loved Miss Evers for herself, the young lady might certainly have discovered the intrinsic value of so disinterested a suitor.
Blanche had an affection for him now, however; Bernard saw no reason to doubt that, and certainly she would have been a very flimsy creature indeed if she had not been touched by his inexhaustible kindness.
She had every conceivable indulgence, and if she married him for his money, at least she had got what she wanted.
I am very fond of Gordon, and yet I am not blinded by affection, as regards his personal appearance.
One would think he had done me an injury in marrying me, and that he wanted to make up for it.
He simply kissed me.
He kisses me about seventeen times a day.
I suppose it &#39;s very improper for a woman to tell any one how often her husband kisses her; but, as you happen to have seen him do it, I don&#39;t suppose you will be scandalized.
That &#39;s why I was afraid to tell Gordon--because when I was married I had such a lot of things; I was supposed to have dresses enough to last for a year.
If he thinks I am extravagant, he can easily stop kissing me.
Bernard was the restless and professionless mortal that we know, wandering in life from one vague experiment to another, constantly gratified and never satisfied, to whom no imperious finality had as yet presented itself; and, nevertheless, for a time he contrived to limit his horizon to the passing hour, and to make a good many hours pass in the drawing-room of a demonstrative flirt.
For Mrs. Gordon was a flirt; that had become tolerably obvious.
Blanche flirted, in fact, more or less with all men, but her opportunity for playing her harmless batteries upon Bernard were of course exceptionally large.
I don&#39;t know what he married me for.
At the end of some three hours, Bernard arrived at a little watering-place which lay close upon the shore, in the embrace of a pair of white-armed cliffs.
This is what Bernard believed that Angela Vivian saw in the fact that by giving his friend a bad account of her he had prevented her making an opulent marriage.
&quot;It is all the more singular, that one of the last persons I saw in America was your charming friend Blanche, who married Gordon Wright.
Of course Blanche was silly; but, equally of course, this young lady&#39;s perception of it was quickened by Blanche&#39;s having married a rich man whom she herself might have married.
It had neither the liberal illumination, the distinguished frequenters, nor the superior music which formed the attraction of that celebrated spot; but it had a modest animation of its own, in which the starlight on the open sea took the place of clustered lamps, and the mighty resonance of the waves performed the function of an orchestra.
Suddenly he put his hand to his heart; it was beating very fast.
He was in love with Angela Vivian, and his love was a throbbing passion!
It was not a feeling to which even a man of Bernard Longueville&#39;s easy power of extracting the savour from a sensation could rapidly habituate himself, and for the rest of that night it was far from making of our hero the happy man that a lover just coming to self-consciousness is supposed to be.
Trouble it was, though this seems an odd name for the consciousness of a bright enchantment; and the first thing that reason, definitely consulted, told him about the matter was that he had been in love with Angela Vivian any time these three years.
The shadow had dropped away and nothing was left but the beauty of his love, which seemed to shine in the freshness of the early day.
The consideration of consequences could easily be deferred, and there would, meanwhile, be no injury to any one in his extracting, very quietly, a little subjective joy from the state of his heart.
He had determined to give himself up to a day&#39;s happiness; it was happiness of a very harmless kind--the satisfaction of thought, the bliss of mere consciousness; but such as it was it did not elude him nor turn bitter in his heart, and the long summer day closed upon him before his spirit, hovering in perpetual circles round the idea of what might be, had begun to rest its wing.
He must have seemed to them wanting in civility, to spend a whole bright Sunday without apparently troubling his head about them, and if the unlucky fact of his being in love with the girl were a reason for doing his duty, it was at least not a reason for being rude.
&quot;Dear little woman,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;she wants to marry her daughter still--only now she wants to marry her to me!&quot;
He wished to show her that he understood her, and he was on the point of seizing her hand, to do he did n&#39;t know what--to hold it, to press it, to kiss it--when he heard the sharp twang of the bell at the door of the little apartment.
Her mother went to her and kissed her.
&quot;I have been in love with you for three years.&quot;
I loved you long before I knew it--before I ventured or presumed to know it.
I questioned my heart--I cross-questioned it.
I love you as my life--I beg you to listen to me!&quot;
In reality I was in love with you.
I love you, and I offer you everything that belongs to me in this world.&quot;
&quot;I said you were a dangerous woman to marry,&quot; he went on deliberately.
I believed that you were ready to marry him, and yet I saw--I thought I saw--&quot; and Bernard paused again.
&quot;Thoroughly good, and dear, doubtless to his wife, the affectionate Blanche.&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;That you were not a woman to marry.&quot;
It &#39;s a lucky thing for me that I am married to Gordon; if I were not he might write to me--to me, to whom it &#39;s a misery to have to answer even an invitation to dinner!
You look as if you were going to marry the Lord Mayor&#39;s daughter!&quot;
Blanche kissed her finger-tips to him in return for this compliment.
His heart was beating; it was a question of saying to Gordon outright, &quot;I have been occupied in becoming engaged to Angela Vivian.&quot;
&quot;We were so very much interested in your marriage,&quot; she went on.
They shook hands with Gordon before getting into the cab, and Mrs. Vivian exclaimed-- &quot;Be sure you give our love to your dear wife!&quot;
One is that you have married another woman.&quot;
&quot;That I am engaged to marry Miss Vivian.&quot;
&quot;To marry Miss Vivian?&quot;
&quot;We are to be married very shortly.
I fell in love with her, and I could n&#39;t run away simply to spare you a surprise.
He was to marry Angela Vivian; that was a very simple fact--it needed no explanation.
Gordon, however, had never been a lover, and if Bernard noted Angela&#39;s gravity it was not because he felt jealous.
&quot;I thanked him from the bottom of my heart; I begged his pardon very humbly for the wrong--if wrong it was--that I was doing him.
&quot;Ah yes, of course,&quot; said Bernard, kissing her.
&quot;If you want really to know, then--can&#39;t you see that your remorse seemed to me connected in a certain way with your affection; a sort of guarantee of it?
You thought you had injured some one or other, and that seemed to be mixed up with your loving me, and therefore I let it alone.&quot;
&quot;Ah,&quot; said Bernard, &quot;my remorse is all gone, and yet I think I love you about as much as ever!
After a while his vexation subsided, and he married poor Blanche; but, on learning to-day that I had accepted you, it flickered up again.
&quot;It was because I adored you.&quot;
&quot;Is that what you mean--that he opposed your marriage?&quot;
&quot;Do you suppose I would wait because I am married?&quot;
&quot;I am not so much married as that, I can tell you!
Do you think I look much as if I were married, with no one to bring me here to-night but Captain Lovelock?&quot;
I have never forgotten how kind you were to me before my marriage--that summer at Baden.
He could go and live over in the Latin Quarter--that &#39;s the desire of his heart--and think of nothing but old bottles.
he murmured to himself; &quot;she does n&#39;t even know we are to be married--Gordon has n&#39;t been able to trust himself to tell her!&quot;
&quot;My own Mrs. Vivian,&quot; she cried, &quot;is she married?&quot;
Angela and I are not married, but we hope to be before long.
Angela went to her and kissed her.
Then she folded her in a prolonged, an exaggerated, embrace.
Meanwhile she congratulated each of her friends half a dozen times; she kissed Mrs. Vivian again, she almost kissed Bernard; she inquired about details; she longed to hear all about Angela&#39;s &quot;things.&quot;
&quot;Poor Mr. Wright had his reasons,&quot; Mrs. Vivian suggested, and then she ventured to explain: &quot;He still cares for Angela, and it was painful to him to talk about her marrying some one else.&quot;
&quot;We must simply marry as soon as possible; to-morrow, if necessary,&quot; said Bernard, with some causticity.
When once Angela is married, Gordon will stop thinking of her.
He will never permit his imagination to hover about a married woman; I am very sure of that.
She is intensely in love with him!&quot;
I must say to her that you have no right to marry her; and beg of her to listen to me and let you go.&quot;
But I was still afraid of you, and in my heart I believed him.
&quot;Ah, you loved him!&quot;
I saw my error, and I bitterly repented of it; and on the day you were married I felt free.&quot;
&quot;It may interest you to know that my marriage is a miserable failure.&quot;
I married her because she was silly.
I thought she had a heart; but that was a mistake.
She is dying to take a lover, and she has got an excellent one waiting for her.
She was ready to take one three months after our marriage.
&quot;He is intensely in love with his wife!&quot;
It brought him, however, less satisfaction than it appeared to bring to his clever companion; for, as he observed plausibly enough, Gordon was quite out of his head, and, this being the case, of what importance was the secret of his heart?
&quot;The secret of his heart and the condition of his head are one and the same thing,&quot; said Angela.
They are in love with each other, and yet they both do nothing but hide it.
He is not in the least in love with poor me--not to-day any more than he was three years ago.
But that &#39;s only a pretext--a chance to pour out the grief and pain which have been accumulating in his heart under a sense of his estrangement from Blanche.
She is wise enough to care for him, greatly, at bottom, and to feel her little heart filled with rage and shame that he does n&#39;t appear to care for her.
If he would take her a little more seriously--it &#39;s an immense pity he married her because she was silly!--she would be flattered by it, and she would try and deserve it.
But she would do it out of spite--not out of affection for the Captain, who must be got immediately out of the way.
Just see the effect of this abominable passion of love, which you have been crying up to me so!
She wished to be more than that, and she took refuge in flirting, simply to excite his jealousy and make him feel strongly about her.
Then, at last-- &quot;Yes, for that purpose it did n&#39;t matter which of us should marry her.
And Miss Vivian&#39;s accepted lover frowned a little.
Your most intimate friend arrived in Paris, and you choose the next day to make a little tour!
I never heard of anything so monstrous as a gentleman rushing away from the object of his affection, for no particular purpose that any one could discover, the day after she has accepted him.
I was a great deal at Mrs. Vivian&#39;s, and I should n&#39;t have felt nearly so much at liberty to go if I had known I should always find you there making love to Mademoiselle.

And this I will do and cause to be done, not in mere love and thankfulness, but because I regard it as an act of plain justice and honour.&quot;
Still it does not appear (which is strange) to have procured for him any lucrative post at court or elsewhere, or to have conferred upon him any other distinction than that which was necessarily included in the countenance of so great a man, and the being invited by him to certain entertainment&#39;s, so splendid and costly in their nature, that he calls them &#39;Golden Balls.&#39;
The wet grass sparkled in the light; the scanty patches of verdure in the hedges--where a few green twigs yet stood together bravely, resisting to the last the tyranny of nipping winds and early frosts--took heart and brightened up; the stream which had been dull and sullen all day long, broke out into a cheerful smile; the birds began to chirp and twitter on the naked boughs, as though the hopeful creatures half believed that winter had gone by, and spring had come already.
With these joyful words they kissed Mr Pecksniff on either cheek; and bore him into the house.
What a pleasant sight was that the contrast they presented; to see each loved and loving one sympathizing with, and devoted to, and leaning on, and yet correcting and counter-checking, and, as it were, antidoting, the other!
Perhaps in no place in the world were so many gorgeous edifices of this class erected as under Mr Pecksniff&#39;s auspices; and if but one-twentieth part of the churches which were built in that front room, with one or other of the Miss Pecksniffs at the altar in the act of marrying the architect, could only be made available by the parliamentary commissioners, no more churches would be wanted for at least five centuries.
There is nothing personal in morality, my love.
It was perfectly charming, and worthy of the Pastoral age, to see how the two Miss Pecksniffs slapped each other after this, and then subsided into an embrace expressive of their different dispositions.
Glancing towards his daughters for the first time since he had begun these reflections, and seeing that they both smiled, Mr Pecksniff eyed them for an instant so jocosely (though still with a kind of saintly waggishness) that the younger one was moved to sit upon his knee forthwith, put her fair arms round his neck, and kiss him twenty times.
During the whole of this affectionate display she laughed to a most immoderate extent: in which hilarious indulgence even the prudent Cherry joined.
&#39;Aye, aye,&#39; returned her father, raising his hand mildly: &#39;it is very well to say what can we expect from Mr Pinch, but Mr Pinch is a fellow-creature, my dear; Mr Pinch is an item in the vast total of humanity, my love; and we have a right, it is our duty, to expect in Mr Pinch some development of those better qualities, the possession of which in our own persons inspires our humble self-respect.
&#39;My loves!&#39;
I will not even remember the conduct of that misguided person&#39;--and here, although he spoke like one at peace with all the world, he used an emphasis that plainly said &quot;I have my eye upon the rascal now&quot;--&#39;that misguided person who has brought you here to-night, seeking to disturb (it is a happiness to say, in vain) the heart&#39;s repose and peace of one who would have shed his dearest blood to serve him.&#39;
&#39;Forgiveness,&#39; said Mr Pecksniff, &#39;entire and pure forgiveness is not incompatible with a wounded heart; perchance when the heart is wounded, it becomes a greater virtue.
As well might one suppose that he doesn&#39;t on all occasions pour out his whole heart and soul to you; that he doesn&#39;t make you a very liberal and indeed rather an extravagant allowance; or, to be more wild and monstrous still, if that be possible, as well might one suppose,&#39; and here, at every word, he struck him lightly on the breast, &#39;that Pecksniff traded in your nature, and that your nature was to be timid and distrustful of yourself, and trustful of all other men, but most of all, of him who least deserves it.
They no longer demand a beautiful virgin for breakfast every morning, with as much regularity as any tame single gentleman expects his hot roll, but rest content with the society of idle bachelors and roving married men; and they are now remarkable rather for holding aloof from the softer sex and discouraging their visits (especially on Saturday nights), than for rudely insisting on their company without any reference to their inclinations, as they are known to have done in days of yore.
Her dark brown hair, disordered from the same cause, had fallen negligently from its bonds, and hung upon her neck; for which instance of its waywardness no male observer would have had the heart to blame it.
Not even by marriage.
&#39;Dear heart alive, there is no harm in the word, sir, if it is an old one.
&#39;I am very much afraid, sir, that his conscience is troubled by his not being related to--or--or even married to--a very young lady--&#39; &#39;Mrs Lupin!&#39;
&#39;At the same time I am bound to say, and I do say with all my heart,&#39; observed the hostess, earnestly, &#39;that her looks and manner almost disarm suspicion.&#39;
&#39;Aye, aye, Mr Chuzzlewit; and don&#39;t imagine that I mean to court or flatter you; for nothing is further from my intention.
&#39;No,&#39; said Mr Pecksniff, keeping his hand in his waistcoat as though he were ready, on the shortest notice, to produce his heart for Martin Chuzzlewit&#39;s inspection, &#39;I came here to offer my services to a stranger.
He rather looked as if any quantity of butter might have been made out of him, by churning the milk of human kindness, as it spouted upwards from his heart.
There is a compact between us that no term of affectionate cajolery shall ever be addressed by either to the other, but that she shall call me always by my Christian name; I her, by hers.
What lawsuits grow out of the graves of rich men, every day; sowing perjury, hatred, and lies among near kindred, where there should be nothing but love!
CHAPTER FOUR FROM WHICH IT WILL APPEAR THAT IF UNION BE STRENGTH, AND FAMILY AFFECTION BE PLEASANT TO CONTEMPLATE, THE CHUZZLEWITS WERE THE STRONGEST AND MOST AGREEABLE FAMILY IN THE WORLD That worthy man Mr Pecksniff having taken leave of his cousin in the solemn terms recited in the last chapter, withdrew to his own home, and remained there three whole days; not so much as going out for a walk beyond the boundaries of his own garden, lest he should be hastily summoned to the bedside of his penitent and remorseful relative, whom, in his ample benevolence, he had made up his mind to forgive unconditionally, and to love on any terms.
It happened on the fourth evening, that Mr Pecksniff walking, as usual, into the bar of the Dragon and finding no Mrs Lupin there, went straight upstairs; purposing, in the fervour of his affectionate zeal, to apply his ear once more to the keyhole, and quiet his mind by assuring himself that the hard-hearted patient was going on well.
I may feel in my own breast, that Mr Chuzzlewit does not regard--me, for instance; say me--with exactly that amount of Christian love which should subsist between us.
&#39;Spottletoe married my father&#39;s brother&#39;s child, didn&#39;t he?
Moreover, Mr Anthony Chuzzlewit and his son Jonas were economically quartered at the Half Moon and Seven Stars, which was an obscure ale-house; and by the very next coach there came posting to the scene of action, so many other affectionate members of the family (who quarrelled with each other, inside and out, all the way down, to the utter distraction of the coachman), that in less than four-and-twenty hours the scanty tavern accommodation was at a premium, and all the private lodgings in the place, amounting to full four beds and sofa, rose cent per cent in the market.
And, oh, the gay simplicity of Mercy; so charming, innocent, and infant-like, that if she had gone out walking by herself, and it had been a little earlier in the season, the robin-redbreasts might have covered her with leaves against her will, believing her to be one of the sweet children in the wood, come out of it, and issuing forth once more to look for blackberries in the young freshness of her heart!
Then there was Mrs Spottletoe, who being much too slim for her years, and of a poetical constitution, was accustomed to inform her more intimate friends that the said whiskers were &#39;the lodestar of her existence;&#39; and who could now, by reason of her strong affection for her uncle Chuzzlewit, and the shock it gave her to be suspected of testamentary designs upon him, do nothing but cry--except moan.
Then there was the widow of a deceased brother of Mr Martin Chuzzlewit, who being almost supernaturally disagreeable, and having a dreary face and a bony figure and a masculine voice, was, in right of these qualities, what is commonly called a strong-minded woman; and who, if she could, would have established her claim to the title, and have shown herself, mentally speaking, a perfect Samson, by shutting up her brother-in-law in a private madhouse, until he proved his complete sanity by loving her very much.
Here, the eldest daughter of the strong-minded woman rose a little way from her seat, and trembling violently from head to foot, more as it seemed with passion than timidity, expressed a general hope that some people WOULD appear in their own characters, if it were only for such a proceeding having the attraction of novelty to recommend it; and that when they (meaning the some people before mentioned) talked about their relations, they would be careful to observe who was present in company at the time; otherwise it might come round to those relations&#39; ears, in a way they little expected; and as to red noses (she observed) she had yet to learn that a red nose was any disgrace, inasmuch as people neither made nor coloured their own noses, but had that feature provided for them without being first consulted; though even upon that branch of the subject she had great doubts whether certain noses were redder than other noses, or indeed half as red as some.
&#39;Very good, my dear madam, very good; whether it is possible by ANY means, we will say by ANY means, to open the eyes of our valued relative to his present infatuation.
&#39;As to looking, I have heard it said, Mrs Ned,&#39; returned Mr George, angrily, &#39;that a cat is free to contemplate a monarch; and therefore I hope I have some right, having been born a member of this family, to look at a person who only came into it by marriage.
&#39;And I will further add,&#39; said Mr George, nodding his head violently at every second syllable; &#39;naming no names, and therefore hurting nobody but those whose consciences tell them they are alluded to, that I think it would be much more decent and becoming, if those who hooked and crooked themselves into this family by getting on the blind side of some of its members before marriage, and manslaughtering them afterwards by crowing over them to that strong pitch that they were glad to die, would refrain from acting the part of vultures in regard to other members of this family who are living.
Now, my dears, if you&#39;re quite ready, and have sufficiently improved yourselves by taking to heart the genteel example of these two young ladies, I think we&#39;ll go.
Mr Pecksniff had, in short, but one comfort, and that was the knowledge that all these his relations and friends had hated him to the very utmost extent before; and that he, for his part, had not distributed among them any more love than, with his ample capital in that respect, he could comfortably afford to part with.
Blessings on thy simple heart, Tom Pinch, how proudly dost thou button up that scanty coat, called by a sad misnomer, for these many years, a &#39;great&#39; one; and how thoroughly, as with thy cheerful voice thou pleasantly adjurest Sam the hostler &#39;not to let him go yet,&#39; dost thou believe that quadruped desires to go, and would go if he might!
Who could repress a smile--of love for thee, Tom Pinch, and not in jest at thy expense, for thou art poor enough already, Heaven knows--to think that such a holiday as lies before thee should awaken that quick flow and hurry of the spirits, in which thou settest down again, almost untasted, on the kitchen window-sill, that great white mug (put by, by thy own hands, last night, that breakfast might not hold thee late), and layest yonder crust upon the seat beside thee, to be eaten on the road, when thou art calmer in thy high rejoicing!
It was not only the married people and the children who gave Tom Pinch a welcome as he passed.
And some of the wickedest among them even kissed their hands as Tom looked back.
&#39;I more than half believed, just now, seeing you so very smart,&#39; said Pinch, &#39;that you must be going to be married, Mark.&#39;
&#39;But the way would be, you know, Mark, according to your views of things,&#39; said Mr Pinch, &#39;to marry somebody you didn&#39;t like, and who was very disagreeable.&#39;
&#39;Lord love you, sir!&#39;
Having seen him eat unto his heart&#39;s content he issued forth again, to wander round the town and regale himself with the shop windows; previously taking a long stare at the bank, and wondering in what direction underground the caverns might be where they kept the money; and turning to look back at one or two young men who passed him, whom he knew to be articled to solicitors in the town; and who had a sort of fearful interest in his eyes, as jolly dogs who knew a thing or two, and kept it up tremendously.
As the grand tones resounded through the church, they seemed, to Tom, to find an echo in the depth of every ancient tomb, no less than in the deep mystery of his own heart.
The feeling that the sounds awakened, in the moment of their existence, seemed to include his whole life and being; and as the surrounding realities of stone and wood and glass grew dimmer in the darkness, these visions grew so much the brighter that Tom might have forgotten the new pupil and the expectant master, and have sat there pouring out his grateful heart till midnight, but for a very earthy old verger insisting on locking up the cathedral forthwith.

</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The same man was in waiting for the horse who had been adjured by Mr Pinch in the morning not to yield to his rabid desire to start; and after delivering the animal into his charge, and beseeching Mr Chuzzlewit in a whisper never to reveal a syllable of what he had just told him in the fullness of his heart, Tom led the pupil in, for instant presentation.
With this kind greeting, Mr Pecksniff fairly took him to his arms, and patted him several times upon the back with his right hand the while, as if to express that his feelings during the embrace were too much for utterance.
said Mr Pecksniff, looking on him with affectionate sadness.
&#39;Such trifles as girls love are here.
Martin, my dear friend, my love to you!
&#39;It is a poor heart that never rejoices; and our hearts are not poor.
In short, his day&#39;s work would have been a pretty heavy one for a porter, but his thorough good-will made nothing of it; and as he sat upon the luggage at last, waiting for the Pecksniffs, escorted by the new pupil, to come down the lane, his heart was light with the hope of having pleased his benefactor.
In truth, the new pupil, not at all disconcerted by the honour of having Miss Mercy Pecksniff on his arm, or by the affectionate adieux of that young lady, approached as Mr Pinch spoke, followed by Miss Charity and Mr Pecksniff.
I am in love, Pinch.&#39;
&#39;I say I am in love.
I am in love with one of the most beautiful girls the sun ever shone upon.
There is nothing very selfish in THAT love, I think?&#39;
To love her as I am sure you do, and yet in consideration for her state of dependence, not even to disclose--&#39; &#39;What are you talking about, Pinch?&#39;
&#39;If I didn&#39;t tell her I loved her, where would be the use of my being in love?&#39;
Her heart was mine, I found.&#39;
&#39;Although I had conducted myself from the first with the utmost circumspection,&#39; pursued Martin, &#39;I had not managed matters so well but that my grandfather, who is full of jealousy and distrust, suspected me of loving her.
He said nothing to her, but straightway attacked me in private, and charged me with designing to corrupt the fidelity to himself (there you observe his selfishness), of a young creature whom he had trained and educated to be his only disinterested and faithful companion, when he should have disposed of me in marriage to his heart&#39;s content.
Upon that, I took fire immediately, and told him that with his good leave I would dispose of myself in marriage, and would rather not be knocked down by him or any other auctioneer to any bidder whomsoever.&#39;
My engagement with the young lady I have been telling you about is likely to be a tolerably long one; for neither her prospects nor mine are very bright; and of course I shall not think of marrying until I am well able to do so.
It would never do, you know, for me to be plunging myself into poverty and shabbiness and love in one room up three pair of stairs, and all that sort of thing.&#39;
At the same time, of course it&#39;s not very hard upon her to be obliged to yield to the necessity of the case; first, because she loves me very much; and secondly, because I have sacrificed a great deal on her account, and might have done much better, you know.&#39;
Tom Pinch&#39;s heart was very tender, and he could not bear to see the most indifferent person in distress; still less one who had awakened an interest in him, and who regarded him (either in fact, or as he supposed) with kindness, and in a spirit of lenient construction.
said Mr Tigg, interrogatively, and kissing his left hand in token of friendship.
&#39;You will understand me when I say that I am the accredited agent of Chevy Slyme; that I am the ambassador from the court of Chiv?
&#39;If that is Mr Pinch,&#39; cried Tigg, kissing his hand again, and beginning to follow his head into the room, &#39;he will permit me to say that I greatly esteem and respect his character, which has been most highly commended to me by my friend Pecksniff; and that I deeply appreciate his talent for the organ, notwithstanding that I do not, if I may use the expression, grind myself.
I have a heart that swells in my bosom.
Then let us have a word or two together; letting it be understood beforehand,&#39; he added this in a grave tone, to prevent the possibility of any mistake, &#39;that I&#39;m not a-going to make no love, you know.&#39;
But it passed off instantly, in a laugh that came from her very heart.
What would be the likely consequence of us two being married?
But love my heart alive!&#39;
That he might the better feed and cherish that sacred flame of gratitude in his breast, Mr Pecksniff remarked that he would trouble his eldest daughter, even in this early stage of their journey, for the brandy-bottle.
One of these flaws was, that having been long taught by his father to over-reach everybody, he had imperceptibly acquired a love of over-reaching that venerable monitor himself.
Taking a confused leave of Anthony and his son, and leaving the luggage of himself and daughters at the office to be called for afterwards, Mr Pecksniff, with one of the young ladies under each arm, dived across the street, and then across other streets, and so up the queerest courts, and down the strangest alleys and under the blindest archways, in a kind of frenzy; now skipping over a kennel, now running for his life from a coach and horses; now thinking he had lost his way, now thinking he had found it; now in a state of the highest confidence, now despondent to the last degree, but always in a great perspiration and flurry; until at length they stopped in a kind of paved yard near the Monument.
She hugged them both; and being by this time overpowered by her feelings or the inclemency of the morning, jerked a little pocket handkerchief out of the little basket, and applied the same to her face.
Mrs Todgers meant by this that she must embrace them once more, which she accordingly did with great ardour.
But the truth was that the house being full with the exception of one bed, which would now be occupied by Mr Pecksniff, she wanted time for consideration; and so much time too (for it was a knotty point how to dispose of them), that even when this second embrace was over, she stood for some moments gazing at the sisters, with affection beaming in one eye, and calculation shining out of the other.
&#39;It was considered so once,&#39; said Mrs Todgers, warming herself in a gentlemanly manner at the fire; &#39;but I hardly thought you would have known it, my loves.&#39;
cried Mrs Todgers, embracing her with great affection.
Mrs Todgers laughed immensely at the dear love&#39;s humour, and declared she was quite afraid of her, that she was.
With these words she gently eluded Mr Pecksniff&#39;s grasp, and took Miss Charity into her own embrace; though whether she was impelled to this proceeding solely by the irrepressible affection she had conceived for that young lady, or whether it had any reference to a lowering, not to say distinctly spiteful expression which had been visible in her face for some moments, has never been exactly ascertained.
Her brother writing in the fullness of his simple heart, had often told her so, and how much more!
&#39;Thomas is well,&#39; said Mr Pecksniff; &#39;and sends his love and this letter.
&#39;I know he has the will, sir,&#39; said Tom Pinch&#39;s sister, &#39;and I know how kindly and considerately you cherish it, for which neither he nor I can ever be grateful enough, as we very often say in writing to each other.
Mr Jinkins thanks them from his heart.
The youngest gentleman in company is pale, but collected, and still sits apart; for his spirit loves to hold communion with itself, and his soul recoils from noisy revellers.
She has a consciousness of his presence and adoration.
It was very short, containing indeed nothing more than an address &#39;with Mr Pecksniff&#39;s respectful, and (not withstanding what has passed) sincerely affectionate regards.&#39;
&#39;Come down into the back parlour, if you please, my love,&#39; said Mr Pecksniff, &#39;and bring your sister with you.&#39;
But when he told them that Mr Chuzzlewit and he were friends, and that Mr Chuzzlewit had said such kind and tender words as pierced his very heart, the two Miss Pecksniffs cried with one accord, &#39;Thank Heaven for this!&#39;
And when they had embraced him with such fervour of affection that no words can describe it, they grouped themselves about his chair, and hung over him, as figuring to themselves no earthly joy like that of ministering to his wants, and crowding into the remainder of his life, the love they would have diffused over their whole existence, from infancy, if he--dear obdurate!--had but consented to receive the precious offering.
Your humble autographs are of no value in themselves, but affection may prize them.&#39;
You don&#39;t know what it is to be required to court his likings and dislikings; to adapt yourself to his prejudices; to do his bidding, be it what it may; to bear with his distrusts and jealousies; and always still be zealous in his service.
My loves, you recollect?&#39;
But when that orphan was commended to their care by one on whom the dammed-up love of years was gushing forth, what exhaustless stores of pure affection yearned to expend themselves upon her!
That, after casting about for the means of a punishment which should rankle in the bosoms of these kites the most, and strike into their gall, I devised this scheme at a time when the last link in the chain of grateful love and duty, that held me to my race, was roughly snapped asunder; roughly, for I loved him well; roughly, for I had ever put my trust in his affection; roughly, for that he broke it when I loved him most--God help me!--and he without a pang could throw me off, while I clung about his heart!
A wonderful affection between them, my dear sir!
These endearments terminated, he took a hasty leave of Mr Pecksniff and withdrew, followed to the door by both father and daughters, who stood there kissing their hands and beaming with affection until he disappeared; though, by the way, he never once looked back, after he had crossed the threshold.
The remark was rendered somewhat obscure in itself, by reason (as the reader may have observed) of a redundancy of negatives; but accompanied by action expressive of a faithful couple walking arm-in-arm towards a parochial church, mutually exchanging looks of love, it clearly signified this youth&#39;s conviction that the caller&#39;s purpose was of an amorous tendency.
Therefore, she replied, with great affection and politeness, that it was, no doubt, very strange indeed; and that she was totally at a loss to conceive what the ridiculous person unknown could mean by it.
&#39;I am quite aware of that, my love.&#39;
Miss Charity replied in effect, that she was unable to say what the habits and propensities of a regular teaser might be; and that even if she possessed such information, it would ill become her to admit the existence of any creature with such an unceremonious name in her family; far less in the person of a beloved sister; &#39;whatever,&#39; added Cherry with an angry glance, &#39;whatever her real nature may be.&#39;
An ancient proverb warns us that we should not expect to find old heads upon young shoulders; to which it may be added that we seldom meet with that unnatural combination, but we feel a strong desire to knock them off; merely from an inherent love we have of seeing things in their right places.
Mr Jonas made no verbal rejoinder, but he glanced at Mercy with an odd expression in his face; and said THAT wouldn&#39;t break his heart, she might depend upon it.
You may take him, Cherry, my love, all to yourself.
But in her sisterly affection she took Mr Jonas to task for leaning so very hard upon a broken reed, and said that he must not be so cruel to poor Merry any more, or she (Charity) would positively be obliged to hate him.
My dear Miss Pecksniffs, your pa is a perfect missionary of peace and love.&#39;
Entertaining an uncertainty as to the particular kind of love supposed to be comprised in Mr Pecksniff&#39;s mission, the young ladies received the compliment rather coldly.
&#39;Why, then, my sweet Miss Pecksniffs,&#39; said the lady of the house; &#39;my own loves, if you will allow me the privilege of taking that freedom on the eve of our separation, Mr Jinkins and the gentlemen have made up a little musical party among themselves, and DO intend, in the dead of this night, to perform a serenade upon the stairs outside the door.
&#39;I should be married to her then, Tom, of course,&#39; said Martin.
What was that which checked Tom Pinch so suddenly, in the high flow of his gladness; bringing the blood into his honest cheeks, and a remorseful feeling to his honest heart, as if he were unworthy of his friend&#39;s regard?
&#39;I should be married to her then,&#39; said Martin, looking with a smile towards the light; &#39;and we should have, I hope, children about us.
It may have required a stronger effort on Tom Pinch&#39;s part to leave the seat on which he sat, and shake his friend by both hands, with nothing but serenity and grateful feeling painted on his face; it may have required a stronger effort to perform this simple act with a pure heart, than to achieve many and many a deed to which the doubtful trumpet blown by Fame has lustily resounded.
&#39;It&#39;s a proof of the kindness of human nature,&#39; said Tom, characteristically putting himself quite out of sight in the matter, &#39;that everybody who comes here, as you have done, is more considerate and affectionate to me than I should have any right to hope, if I were the most sanguine creature in the world; or should have any power to express, if I were the most eloquent.
And behold, on the first floor, at the court-end of the house, in a room with all the window-curtains drawn, a fire piled half-way up the chimney, plates warming before it, wax candles gleaming everywhere, and a table spread for three, with silver and glass enough for thirty--John Westlock; not the old John of Pecksniff&#39;s, but a proper gentleman; looking another and a grander person, with the consciousness of being his own master and having money in the bank; and yet in some respects the old John too, for he seized Tom Pinch by both his hands the instant he appeared, and fairly hugged him, in his cordial welcome.
I have a great esteem and friendship for you; I love you very much; and have been perfectly charmed and overjoyed to-day, to find you just the same as ever; but I cannot listen to this.&#39;
I beg your pardon with all my heart.&#39;
&#39;Thank you; I&#39;ll drink it with all my heart, John.
&#39;You know, John,&#39; said Mr Pinch, &#39;your very good nature and kindness of heart make you thoughtless, and you can&#39;t be too careful on such a point as this.
Mr Tigg and I are not on such an intimate footing that you need be at all uneasy, I give you my solemn assurance of that, Tom.
Tom saw that Martin looked at Mr Pecksniff as though he could have easily found it in his heart to give HIM an invitation to a very warm place; but he was quite silent, and standing opposite that gentleman at the table, regarded him attentively.
Martin looked at him, and made no answer; but a curious observer might have detected an ominous twitching at his mouth, and perhaps an involuntary attraction of his right hand in the direction of Mr Pecksniff&#39;s cravat.
This lowly roof, sir, must not be contaminated by the presence of one who has deceived, and cruelly deceived, an honourable, beloved, venerated, and venerable gentleman; and who wisely suppressed that deceit from me when he sought my protection and favour, knowing that, humble as I am, I am an honest man, seeking to do my duty in this carnal universe, and setting my face against all vice and treachery.
To add to his other miseries, he was by this time sensible of being wet to the skin, and cold at his very heart.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>In the end he came back to one of the first he had seen, and entering by a side-door in a court, where the three balls, with the legend &#39;Money Lent,&#39; were repeated in a ghastly transparency, passed into one of a series of little closets, or private boxes, erected for the accommodation of the more bashful and uninitiated customers.
In proportion as he became more and more dejected by his present circumstances, and the means of gaining America receded from his grasp, the more he fretted himself with the conviction that that was the only place in which he could hope to achieve any high end, and worried his brain with the thought that men going there in the meanwhile might anticipate him in the attainment of those objects which were dearest to his heart.
And mark my words, if I go alone it shall be, to carry out the principle, in the rottenest, craziest, leakingest tub of a wessel that a place can be got in for love or money.
Why, love my heart alive!
But he adapted them, according to the best of his judgment, to Mr Tapley&#39;s comprehension; and with that view made as light of his love affair as he could, and referred to it in very few words.
&#39;And a young lady as any gentleman ought to feel more proud of being in love with,&#39; said Mark, energetically, &#39;don&#39;t draw breath.&#39;
&#39;If you have changed at all, my love, since we parted,&#39; said Martin at length, as he looked upon her with a proud delight, &#39;it is only to be more beautiful than ever!&#39;
Unspoiled, unpampered in her joys or griefs; with frank and full, and deep affection for the object of her early love; she saw in him one who for her sake was an outcast from his home and fortune, and she had no more idea of bestowing that love upon him in other than cheerful and sustaining words, full of high hope and grateful trustfulness, than she had of being unworthy of it, in her lightest thought or deed, for any base temptation that the world could offer.
&#39;Why, as to that, my love,&#39; said Martin as he drew her waist within his arm, first looking round to see that there were no observers near, and beholding Mr Tapley more intent than ever on the fog; &#39;it would be strange if I did not; for my life--especially of late--has been a hard one.&#39;
You have paid a dear price for a poor heart, Martin; but it is at least your own, and a true one.&#39;
And don&#39;t say a poor heart, Mary, for I say a rich one.
my love; but you should ask me in the same breath, have I thought of starving at home; have I thought of doing porter&#39;s work for a living; have I thought of holding horses in the streets to earn my roll of bread from day to day?
He HAS daughters, has he, love?&#39;
He stopped to look into her eyes again, and seeing, in a hasty glance over his shoulder, that there was no one near, and that Mark was still intent upon the fog, not only looked at her lips, too, but kissed them into the bargain.
said Martin, &#39;that&#39;s not worth speaking of, my love.
&#39;I thank him from my heart!&#39;
I have completed my arrangements for going to America; and you will be surprised to hear that I am to be accompanied by Mark Tapley, upon whom I have stumbled strangely in London, and who insists on putting himself under my protection&#39;--meaning, my love,&#39; said Martin, breaking off again, &#39;our friend in the rear, of course.&#39;
You&#39;ll like him of all things, my love, I know.
That heart where self has found no place and raised no throne, is slow to recognize its ugly presence when it looks upon it.
If you would but sometimes, in some quiet hour; beside the winter fire; in the summer air; when you hear gentle music, or think of Death, or Home, or Childhood; if you would at such a season resolve to think, but once a month, or even once a year, of him, or any one who ever wronged you, you would forgive him in your heart, I know!&#39;
And therefore, love&#39;--he drew her quickly to him, for the time of parting had now come--&#39;in the first letter that you write to me through the Post Office, addressed to New York; and in all the others that you send through Pinch; remember he has no existence, but has become to us as one who is dead.
How could I move on land or sea without it, love?&#39;
said Martin, kissing it--let us do him justice, it was for her sake; not for theirs--and putting it on his little finger.
Her lover&#39;s strange obtuseness in relation to this little incident, promptly suggested to Mark&#39;s mind its real cause and root; and from that moment he had a clear and perfect insight into the one absorbing principle of Martin&#39;s character.
Not to mention that in gaining her affection I have followed the bent of my own wishes, and baulked the selfish schemes of others who had no right to form them.
But she sent her last letter by hand, and it don&#39;t seem to have been very clearly understood between &#39;em without it, and if she don&#39;t see him a-waving his pocket-handkerchief on the shore, like a pictur out of a song-book, my opinion is, she&#39;ll break her heart.&#39;
&#39;I didn&#39;t know you took it so much to heart as this comes to.&#39;
So the ladies passed out in single file; Mr Jefferson Brick and such other married gentlemen as were left, acknowledging the departure of their other halves by a nod; and there was an end of THEM.
You have come here on some design of improving your fortune, I dare say; and I should grieve to put you out of heart.
&#39;Lord love you, sir,&#39; he added, &#39;they&#39;re so fond of Liberty in this part of the globe, that they buy her and sell her and carry her to market with &#39;em.
Night then coming on apace, Martin proposed that they should adjourn to Mrs Pawkins&#39;s establishment for coffee; but in this he was overruled by his new acquaintance, who seemed to have set his heart on carrying him, though it were only for an hour, to the house of a friend of his who lived hard by.
Martin thought it rather stange, and in some sort inconsistent, that during the whole of these narrations, and in the very meridian of their enjoyment thereof, both Mr Norris the father, and Mr Norris Junior, the son (who corresponded, every post, with four members of the English Peerage), enlarged upon the inestimable advantage of having no such arbitrary distinctions in that enlightened land, where there were no noblemen but nature&#39;s noblemen, and where all society was based on one broad level of brotherly love and natural equality.
The general was as warmly received as if New York had been in a state of siege and no other general was to be got for love or money.
&#39;The artificial barriers set up between man and man; the division of the human race into court cards and plain cards, of every denomination--into clubs, diamonds, spades--anything but heart!&#39;
If that peculiarly transatlantic article, a moral sense--for, if native statesmen, orators, and pamphleteers, are to be believed, America quite monopolises the commodity--if that peculiarly transatlantic article be supposed to include a benevolent love of all mankind, certainly Martin&#39;s would have borne, just then, a deal of waking.
With which he produced a very large tumbler, piled up to the brim with little blocks of clear transparent ice, through which one or two thin slices of lemon, and a golden liquid of delicious appearance, appealed from the still depths below, to the loving eye of the spectator.
When he had scowled at him to his heart&#39;s content, Jonas took the candle from the table, and walking into the glass office, produced a bunch of keys from his pocket.
You needn&#39;t trouble yourself to be too affectionate.
The combined effects of the shaking and this loving remonstrance soon awoke the old man, who gave Mr Pecksniff a chuckling welcome which was attributable in part to his being glad to see that gentleman, and in part to his unfading delight in the recollection of having called him a hypocrite.
&#39;Why, then,&#39; said Mr Pecksniff, &#39;I will be bold to say, with the utmost sympathy for his afflictions, and the greatest admiration of those excellent qualities which do equal honour to his head and to his heart, that he is what is playfully termed a dummy.
The bird-fancier was an easy shaver also, and a fashionable hair-dresser also, and perhaps he had been sent for, express, from the court end of the town, to trim a lord, or cut and curl a lady; but however that might be, there, upon his own ground, he was not; nor was there any more distinct trace of him to assist the imagination of an inquirer, than a professional print or emblem of his calling (much favoured in the trade), representing a hair-dresser of easy manners curling a lady of distinguished fashion, in the presence of a patent upright grand pianoforte.
Noting these circumstances, Mr Pecksniff, in the innocence of his heart, applied himself to the knocker; but at the first double knock every window in the street became alive with female heads; and before he could repeat the performance whole troops of married ladies (some about to trouble Mrs Gamp themselves very shortly) came flocking round the steps, all crying out with one accord, and with uncommon interest, &#39;Knock at the winder, sir, knock at the winder.
&quot;Mrs Harris,&quot; I says to her, &quot;don&#39;t name the charge, for if I could afford to lay all my feller creeturs out for nothink, I would gladly do it, sich is the love I bears &#39;em.
&#39;Such affectionate regret, sir, I never saw.
Mrs Gamp and Mr Pecksniff then ascended the staircase; and the former, having been shown to the chamber in which all that remained of Anthony Chuzzlewit lay covered up, with but one loving heart, and that a halting one, to mourn it, left the latter free to enter the darkened room below, and rejoin Mr Jonas, from whom he had now been absent nearly two hours.
&#39;I loved him,&#39; cried the old man, weeping.
Had I the heart to take him down!&#39;
It&#39;s because the laying out of money with a well-conducted establishment, where the thing is performed upon the very best scale, binds the broken heart, and sheds balm upon the wounded spirit.
There you mistake him; but an afflicted gentleman, an affectionate gentleman, who knows what it is in the power of money to do, in giving him relief, and in testifying his love and veneration for the departed.
heard no sound but the echoes, lingering in his own heart, of a voice for ever silent.
&#39;I loved him,&#39; cried the old man, sinking down upon the grave when all was done.
CHAPTER TWENTY IS A CHAPTER OF LOVE &#39;Pecksniff,&#39; said Jonas, taking off his hat, to see that the black crape band was all right; and finding that it was, putting it on again, complacently; &#39;what do you mean to give your daughters when they marry?&#39;
&#39;My dear Mr Jonas,&#39; cried the affectionate parent, with an ingenuous smile, &#39;what a very singular inquiry!&#39;
The heart is not always a royal mint, with patent machinery to work its metal into current coin.
&quot;I never will give my hand, papa&quot;--those were her words--&quot;unless my heart is won.&quot;
&#39;With all my heart,&#39; said Mr Pecksniff.
It was a time when most men cherish good resolves, and sorrow for the wasted past; when most men, looking on the shadows as they gather, think of that evening which must close on all, and that to-morrow which has none beyond.
She knew him instantly, and rushed into his fond embrace.
&#39;Call her down, my love.&#39;
cried the arch girl, turning to her cousin when she had kissed her father on both cheeks, and in her frolicsome nature had bestowed a supernumerary salute upon the tip of his nose, &#39;YOU here, fright!
&#39;Any trick is fair in love,&#39; said Jonas.
This gallant speech was succeeded by a confused noise of kissing and slapping; and then the fair but much dishevelled Merry broke away, and followed in the footsteps of her sister.
the dearest wish of my heart is now fulfilled!&#39;
Again it breathes the blessed air of Independence; again it contemplates with pious awe that moral sense which renders unto Ceasar nothing that is his; again inhales that sacred atmosphere which was the life of him--oh noble patriot, with many followers!--who dreamed of Freedom in a slave&#39;s embrace, and waking sold her offspring and his own in public markets.
But Lord love us, he was one of another Company, I dare say, and only made up the story that we might go to his Eden, and not the opposition one.&#39;
&#39;I can honestly say that I hope so, with all my heart.&#39;
&#39;General Choke,&#39; said Mr La Fayette Kettle, &#39;you warm my heart; sir, you warm my heart.
Being located in the immediate neighbourhood of your Parks, your Drives, your Triumphant Arches, your Opera, and your Royal Almacks, it nat&#39;rally suggests itself as the place for holding a luxurious and thoughtless court.
And, consequently,&#39; said the General, &#39;consequently, the court is held there.&#39;
At the sounding of a dismal gong, this pleasant company went trooping down from all parts of the house to the public room; while from the neighbouring stores other guests came flocking in, in shoals; for half the town, married folks as well as single, resided at the National Hotel.
&#39;Lord love you, sir,&#39; cried Mark, &#39;don&#39;t have my name in it.
Here is my hand, and here my heart.
You air now, sir, a denizen of the most powerful and highly-civilised dominion that has ever graced the world; a do-minion, sir, where man is bound to man in one vast bond of equal love and truth.
He then learned that the Watertoast Association sympathized with a certain Public Man in Ireland, who held a contest upon certain points with England; and that they did so, because they didn&#39;t love England at all--not by any means because they loved Ireland much; being indeed horribly jealous and distrustful of its people always, and only tolerating them because of their working hard, which made them very useful; labour being held in greater indignity in the simple republic than in any other country upon earth.
and now holds its breath, and swells the blue veins in its forehead nigh to bursting, as it watches, sir, with feverish intensity and sympathetic ardour, your noble efforts in the cause of Freedom.&quot;&#39;
&#39;&quot;Devoted, mind and body, heart and soul, to Freedom, sir--to Freedom, blessed solace to the snail upon the cellar-door, the oyster in his pearly bed, the still mite in his home of cheese, the very winkle of your country in his shelly lair--in her unsullied name, we offer you our sympathy.
&#39;&quot;I am, sir, in Freedom&#39;s name, &#39;&quot;Your affectionate friend and faithful Sympathiser, &#39;&quot;CYRUS CHOKE, &#39;&quot;General, U.S.M.&quot;&#39;
&#39;Mrs Hominy is going Toe stay until the end of the Fall, sir, with her married daughter at the settlement of New Thermopylae, three days this side of Eden.
Mrs Hominy had had her letters from abroad, beginning &#39;My ever dearest blank,&#39; and signed &#39;The Mother of the Modern Gracchi&#39; (meaning the married Miss Hominy), regularly printed in a public journal, with all the indignation in capitals, and all the sarcasm in italics.
So Mrs Hominy at last came down on Martin heavily, and as he was fast asleep, she had it all her own way, and bruised him to her heart&#39;s content.
There was the horrible Hominy talking deep truths in a melodious snuffle, and pouring forth her mental endowments to such an extent that the Major&#39;s bitterest enemy, hearing her, would have forgiven him from the bottom of his heart.
The married Miss Hominy, who had come on board with her husband, gave to this statement her most unqualified support, as did that gentleman also.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Keep a good heart, sir.
&#39;I&#39;m sorry for it, governor, with all my heart,&#39; said Mark, shaking him by the hand.
&#39;Lord love you, sir!&#39;
It was impossible not to take heart, in the company of such a man as this.
And lastly, he brought forth a great placard (which Martin in the exultation of his heart had prepared with his own hands at the National Hotel) bearing the inscription, CHUZZLEWIT &amp; CO., ARCHITECTS AND SURVEYORS, which he displayed upon the most conspicuous part of the premises, with as much gravity as if the thriving city of Eden had a real existence, and they expected to be overwhelmed with business.
Their fair young friend, too,&#39; said Mr Pecksniff, &#39;whom they so desire to know and love--indeed to know her, is to love--I hope I see her well.
If features are an index to the heart, I have no fears of that.
He is not a dealer in it, and it comes from his heart.
It is merely an hysterical affection; nothing more, I am not uneasy.
But that Mr Anthony, in the evening of his life, was happier in the affection of his excellent son--a pattern, my dear sir, a pattern to all sons--and in the care of a distant relation who, however lowly in his means of serving him, had no bounds to his inclination; I can inform you.&#39;
Mr Pecksniff&#39;s situation was peculiarly trying; for, what with having constantly to keep the peace between his daughters; to maintain a reasonable show of affection and unity in his household; to curb the growing ease and gaiety of Jonas, which vented itself in sundry insolences towards Mr Pinch, and an indefinable coarseness of manner in reference to Mary (they being the two dependants); to make no mention at all of his having perpetually to conciliate his rich old relative, and to smooth down, or explain away, some of the ten thousand bad appearances and combinations of bad appearances, by which they were surrounded on that unlucky evening--what with having to do this, and it would be difficult to sum up how much more, without the least relief or assistance from anybody, it may be easily imagined that Mr Pecksniff had in his enjoyment something more than that usual portion of alloy which is mixed up with the best of men&#39;s delights.
First among the meetings to which Tom had long looked forward with a beating heart, it was memorable for nothing but embarrassment and confusion.
I&#39;ve heard something of you, my friend, and your meek ways; and I recommend you to forget &#39;em till I am married to one of Pecksniff&#39;s gals, and not to curry favour among my relations, but to leave the course clear.
When Jonas knocked at the door, Tom&#39;s heart beat high; higher when Miss Mercy answered it, and seeing her wounded lover, shireked aloud; higher, when he followed them into the family parlour; higher than at any other time, when Jonas spoke.
She turned her flushed face upon Tom to confirm her words by its kindling expression; and seizing his right hand, pressed it to her breast, and kissed it.
God&#39;s love upon thy patience, Tom!
Who, that had beheld thee, for three summer weeks, poring through half the deadlong night over the jingling anatomy of that inscrutable old harpsichord in the back parlour, could have missed the entrance to thy secret heart: albeit it was dimly known to thee?
And if a friendly glance--aye, even though it were as guileless as thine own, Dear Tom--could have but pierced the twilight of that evening, when, in a voice well tempered to the time, sad, sweet, and low, yet hopeful, she first sang to the altered instrument, and wondered at the change; and thou, sitting apart at the open window, kept a glad silence and a swelling heart--must not that glance have read perforce the dawning of a story, Tom, that it were well for thee had never been begun!
Could it be that she had broken with Martin, or had never returned his affection, save in his own bold and heightened fancy?
Her surprise was not diminished when he took his seat upon the turf beside her, and opened a conversation thus: &#39;When are you to be married?&#39;
Frivolous you are, and love to be, undoubtedly; but you must have some heart.&#39;
&#39;If it be odd in me to desire to know whether you love the young man whom I understand you are to marry, I AM very odd,&#39; said Martin.
&#39;Then you don&#39;t love him?&#39;
&#39;Being at the same time engaged to marry him,&#39; observed the old man.
&#39;But I told the wretch--my dear Mr Chuzzlewit, I told him when he asked me--that if I ever did marry him, it should only be that I might hate and tease him all my life.&#39;
&#39;Has it ever occurred to you,&#39; said Martin, &#39;that your married life may perhaps be miserable, full of bitterness, and most unhappy?&#39;
Mr Jonas withdrew his arm, and for a moment looked at her more like a murderer than a lover.
I can&#39;t afford to go on dawdling about here half my life, I needn&#39;t tell you, and Pecksniff says that father&#39;s being so lately dead makes very little odds; for we can be married as quiet as we please down here, and my being lonely is a good reason to the neighbours for taking a wife home so soon, especially one that he knew.
said Jonas, looking after her, and biting a piece of straw, almost to powder; &#39;you&#39;ll catch it for this, when you ARE married.
Mr Mould looked lovingly at Mrs Mould, who sat hard by, and was a helpmate to him in his punch as in all other things.
I&#39;ve seen worse than that in the Sunday papers, my love.&#39;
&#39;Wishing ev&#39;ry happiness to this happy family,&#39; said Mrs Gamp &#39;with all my heart.
If they draws the Brighton Old Tipper here, I takes THAT ale at night, my love, it bein&#39; considered wakeful by the doctors.
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX AN UNEXPECTED MEETING, AND A PROMISING PROSPECT The laws of sympathy between beards and birds, and the secret source of that attraction which frequently impels a shaver of the one to be a dealer in the other, are questions for the subtle reasoning of scientific bodies; not the less so, because their investigation would seem calculated to lead to no particular result.
He had a tender heart, too; for, when he had a good commission to provide three or four score sparrows for a shooting-match, he would observe, in a compassionate tone, how singular it was that sparrows should have been made expressly for such purposes.
&#39;He&#39;s newly married, and he brings his young wife home to-night,&#39; said the barber.
cried Mr Bailey, slapping a little cloud of pipe-clay out of his left leg, &#39;then he&#39;s been and married the merry one!&#39;
He was yet in the fullness of his narrative when the sound of wheels, and a double knock at the street door, announced the arrival of the newly married couple.
&#39;Would you be so good, my darling dovey of a dear young married lady,&#39; Mrs Gamp observed, in a low voice, &#39;as put that somewheres where you can keep it in your mind?
&#39;You are not married?&#39;
&#39;Not married?&#39;
On the doorpost was painted again in large letters, &#39;offices of the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company,&#39; and on the door was a large brass plate with the same inscription; always kept very bright, as courting inquiry; staring the City out of countenance after office hours on working days, and all day long on Sundays; and looking bolder than the Bank.
He had a portentously sagacious chin, and a pompous voice, with a rich huskiness in some of its tones that went directly to the heart, like a ray of light shining through the ruddy medium of choice old burgundy.
&#39;I shall be eternally delighted,&#39; answered Tigg, kissing his hand and smiling sweetly.
Jonas shook his head again, as much as to say, &#39;You&#39;re right there;&#39; And then resumed, jocosely: &#39;Not such an old hand, either, but that I&#39;ve been and got married.
&#39;So it is,&#39; cried Tigg, kissing his hand in honour of the sex.
The latter considerations were only second to his avarice; for, conscious that there was nothing in his person, conduct, character, or accomplishments, to command respect, he was greedy of power, and was, in his heart, as much a tyrant as any laureled conqueror on record.
She set the light upon a bracket in the hall, and laid her hand upon her heart; upon her eyes; upon her burning head.
Her entreaty was so earnest, that the boy had not the heart to stay there.
I married you that I might.
What else did I marry you for?
It might have softened him--indeed it might--to hear her turn a little fragment of a song he used to say he liked; trying, with a heart so full, to win him back.
Why, things have opened to me, now, so that I might marry almost where I liked.
She went up to him, as it seemed, and spoke lovingly; saying that she would defer to him in everything and would consult his wishes and obey them, and they might be very happy if he would be gentle with her.
She only said, repeating it in agony of heart, how could he, could he, could he--and lost utterance in tears.
Oh woman, God beloved in old Jerusalem!
Disinterested affection is always flattering.
The barber gave a soft murmur, as much as to say that Mrs Harris&#39;s remark, though perhaps not quite so intelligible as could be desired from such an authority, did equal honour to her head and to her heart.
&#39;They haven&#39;t been married so long,&#39; observed Poll, rubbing his hands, &#39;that they need be anything but pleasant yet awhile.&#39;
Let me kiss your hand for all your goodness to me.
The gentleman that Mrs Gamp thought likely to suit us is in the coach, my love.&#39;
There can be no kind of objection to your kissing your hand to him, my dear.&#39;
I am quite glad you did it, my love.
And first of Mr Pecksniff it may be observed, that having provided for his youngest daughter that choicest of blessings, a tender and indulgent husband; and having gratified the dearest wish of his parental heart by establishing her in life so happily; he renewed his youth, and spreading the plumage of his own bright conscience, felt himself equal to all kinds of flights.
The gentle Cherry, stung by a sense of slight and injury, which far from softening down or wearing out, rankled and festered in her heart--the gentle Cherry was in flat rebellion.
Miss Pecksniff&#39;s answer was scarcely a response to this gush of affection, for it was simply, &#39;Bother, Pa!&#39;
&#39;I am not so many years older than my sister, either, though she IS married to your friend!&#39;
It is possible that Miss Pecksniff saw in Mrs Todgers&#39;s a vision of enthusiastic men, pining to fall in adoration at her feet.
It is not possible that Mr Pecksniff had any thoughts of marrying again; or that his daughter, with the sharp eye of a single woman, fathomed his design!
But when Mr Pecksniff pondered on this subject (as, in his zealous way, he often did), and thought with an uplifted heart of the train of circumstances which had delivered the old gentleman into his hands for the confusion of evil-doers and the triumph of a righteous nature, he always felt that Mary Graham was his stumbling-block.
Let the old man say what he would, Mr Pecksniff knew he had a strong affection for her.
&#39;Then,&#39; said Mr Pecksniff &#39;what if I married her!
What,&#39; repeated Mr Pecksniff, sticking up his hair and glancing at his bust by Spoker; &#39;what if, making sure of his approval first--he is nearly imbecile, poor gentleman--I married her!&#39;
As to consulting the wishes of her heart in such a case, it formed no part of Mr Pecksniff&#39;s moral code; for he knew what a good man he was, and what a blessing he must be to anybody.
Orphan though she was, she would have found some one to protect her whom she might have loved again.
Such is the delicate texture of the human heart; so complicated is the process of its being softened!
Mr Pecksniff kissed his hand, and was at her side immediately.
Mr Pecksniff now repeated the Todgers performance on a comfortable scale, as if he intended it to last some time; and in his disengaged hand, catching hers, employed himself in separating the fingers with his own, and sometimes kissing them, as he pursued the conversation thus: &#39;I am glad we met.
I love you!&#39;
&#39;I love you,&#39; said Mr Pecksniff, &#39;my gentle life, with a devotion which is quite surprising, even to myself.
She tried to disengage her hand, but might as well have tried to free herself from the embrace of an affectionate boa-constrictor; if anything so wily may be brought into comparison with Pecksniff.
&#39;Although I am a widower,&#39; said Mr Pecksniff, examining the rings upon her fingers, and tracing the course of one delicate blue vein with his fat thumb, &#39;a widower with two daughters, still I am not encumbered, my love.
One of them, as you know, is married.
Mr Pecksniff walked on with his arm round her waist, and her hand in his, as contentedly as if they had been all in all to each other, and were joined in the bonds of truest love.
&#39;Is it not enough,&#39; said Mary, &#39;that you warp and change his nature, adapt his every prejudice to your bad ends, and harden a heart naturally kind by shutting out the truth and allowing none but false and distorted views to reach it; is it not enough that you have the power of doing this, and that you exercise it, but must you also be so coarse, so cruel, and so cowardly to me?&#39;
How little did she know his heart!&#39;
Her mind was so strangely constituted that she would have preferred the caresses of a toad, an adder, or a serpent--nay, the hug of a bear--to the endearments of Mr Pecksniff.
I am not angry, my love.&#39;
There was a beating heart beneath his hand that told another story though.
&#39;A passive quarrel, my love,&#39; said Mr Pecksniff, &#39;may be changed into an active one, remember.
You will consent, my love; you will consent, I know.
When we are married, you shall have the satisfaction of thinking that it didn&#39;t last to ruin him, but passed away to do him good; for we&#39;ll see then what we can do to put some trifling help in Martin junior&#39;s way.
Receiving no reply he kissed it instead; and then stooping down, inclined his flabby face to hers--he had a flabby face, although he WAS a good man--and with a blessing, which from such a source was quite enough to set her up in life, and prosper her from that time forth permitted her to leave him.
Gallantry in its true sense is supposed to ennoble and dignify a man; and love has shed refinements on innumerable Cymons.
are YOU going to be married, Miss Pecksniff?&#39;
He believed it from the bottom of his heart.
&#39;No,&#39; said Cherry, &#39;I am not going to be married.
But you have been a good angel to me; filling me with gratitude of heart, hope, and courage.&#39;
&#39;But what is he--oh, Mr Pinch, what IS he--who, thinking he could compass these designs the better if I were his wife, assails me with the coward&#39;s argument that if I marry him, Martin, on whom I have brought so much misfortune, shall be restored to something of his former hopes; and if I do not, shall be plunged in deeper ruin?
What is he who makes my very constancy to one I love with all my heart a torture to myself and wrong to him; who makes me, do what I will, the instrument to hurt a head I would heap blessings on!
What is he who, winding all these cruel snares about me, explains their purpose to me, with a smooth tongue and a smiling face, in the broad light of day; dragging me on, the while, in his embrace, and holding to his lips a hand,&#39; pursued the agitated girl, extending it, &#39;which I would have struck off, if with it I could lose the shame and degradation of his touch?&#39;
Tears and sobs from her were arrows in his heart.
Aye, though he loved her from his soul with such a self-denying love as woman seldom wins; he spoke from first to last of Martin.
Not the wealth of the rich Indies would have tempted Tom to shirk one mention of her lover&#39;s name.
Such was my faith in Thomas Pinch, that I would have cast the falsehood back into the Serpent&#39;s teeth, and would have taken Thomas to my heart.
&#39;From fragments of a conversation which I overheard in the church, just now, Mr Pinch,&#39; said Pecksniff, &#39;between yourself and Miss Graham--I say fragments, because I was slumbering at a considerable distance from you, when I was roused by your voices--and from what I saw, I ascertained (I would have given a great deal not to have ascertained, Mr Pinch) that you, forgetful of all ties of duty and of honour, sir; regardless of the sacred laws of hospitality, to which you were pledged as an inmate of this house; have presumed to address Miss Graham with unreturned professions of attachment and proposals of love.&#39;
Something without a name; compassion, sorrow, old tenderness, mistaken gratitude, habit; none of these, and yet all of them; smote upon Tom&#39;s gentle heart at parting.
There was no such soul as Pecksniff&#39;s in that carcase; and yet, though his speaking out had not involved the compromise of one he loved, he couldn&#39;t have denounced the very shape and figure of the man.
Under less uncommon circumstances, it would have cut Tom to the heart to leave these things and think that he saw them for the last time; but it didn&#39;t now.
At any other time he would have parted from it with a pang, thinking of all he had learned there, of the many hours he had passed there; for the love of his very dreams.
&#39;The kindness of people is enough to break one&#39;s heart!
There were several people, young and old, standing about the door, some of whom cried with Mrs Lupin; while others tried to keep up a stout heart, as Tom did; and others were absorbed in admiration of Mr Pecksniff--a man who could build a church, as one may say, by squinting at a sheet of paper; and others were divided between that feeling and sympathy with Tom.
The tollman--a crusty customer, always smoking solitary pipes in a Windsor chair, inside, set artfully between two little windows that looked up and down the road, so that when he saw anything coming up he might hug himself on having toll to take, and when he saw it going down, might hug himself on having taken it--the tollman was out in an instant.
He had no heart for tea or supper, meat or drink of any kind, but sat by himself before an empty table in the public room while the bed was getting ready, revolving in his mind all that had happened that eventful day, and wondering what he could or should do for the future.
She foresaw with astonishing clearness that the object of Mr Pecksniff&#39;s attachment was designing, worthless, and wicked; and receiving from Charity the fullest confirmation of these views, protested with tears in her eyes that she loved Miss Pecksniff like a sister, and felt her injuries as if they were her own.
&#39;Your real darling sister, I have not seen her more than once since her marriage,&#39; said Mrs Todgers, &#39;and then I thought her looking poorly.
&#39;But when the marriage took place,&#39; said Mrs Todgers, proceeding with her subject, &#39;when it was in the paper, and was read out here at breakfast, I thought he had taken leave of his senses, I did indeed.
Towards this most unhappy Moddle, Miss Pecksniff conducted herself at first with distant haughtiness, being in no humour to be entertained with dirges in honour of her married sister.
On the fourteenth night, he kissed Miss Pecksniff&#39;s snuffers, in the passage, when she went upstairs to bed; meaning to have kissed her hand, but missing it.
Miss Pecksniff controverting this opinion as sinful, Moddle was goaded on to ask whether she could be contented with a blighted heart; and it appearing on further examination that she could be, plighted his dismal troth, which was accepted and returned.
Mr Moddle, living in the atmosphere of Miss Pecksniff&#39;s love, dwelt (if he had but known it) in a terrestrial Paradise.
The woman shed tears, in very joy to see him; the man shook both his hands and would not let them go; the two boys hugged his legs; the sick child in the mother&#39;s arms stretched out her burning little fingers, and muttered, in her hoarse, dry throat, his well-remembered name.
Not that he had the least strength of heart or hope, or steady purpose in so doing, beyond the habitual cheerfulness of his disposition, and his amazing power of self-sustainment; for within himself, he looked on their condition as beyond all hope, and, in his own words, &#39;came out strong&#39; in consequence.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>He had used these weapons with distinguished effect in several instances, all duly chronicled in the newspapers; and was greatly beloved for the gallant manner in which he had &#39;jobbed out&#39; the eye of one gentleman, as he was in the act of knocking at his own street-door.
He remembered nothing but the better qualities of his fellow-wanderer, and was devoted to him, heart and hand.
Mr Tapley was very much surprised at this admission, but protested, with great vehemence, that they would have been there all the same; and that he had set his heart upon coming to Eden, from the first word he had ever heard of it.
You&#39;ve ventured a good deal for a young lady&#39;s love!&#39;
&#39;Your approbation of My labours in the common cause goes to My heart.
The object of the popular caress looked round the room as he walked up it, and smiled; at the same time observing to the shrill boy, that he knew something of the beauty of the daughters of their common country, but had never seen it in such lustre and perfection as at that moment.
&#39;The cook of the Screw went and got married yesterday, sir,&#39; said Mr Tapley.
Not having had the heart to write in our distress--you yourself thought silence most advisable--and consequently, never having heard from her since we left New York the first time, I don&#39;t know where she is, my good fellow.&#39;
&#39;The present occasion,&#39; he said, &#39;will ever be memorable to me; not only for the reasons I have assigned, but because it has afforded me an opportunity of becoming personally known to a gentleman--&#39; Here he pointed the trowel at Mr Pecksniff, who was greeted with vociferous cheering, and laid his hand upon his heart.
This address, pumped out apparently from Mr Pecksniff&#39;s very heart, brought the enthusiasm to its highest pitch.
What a different town Salisbury was in Tom Pinch&#39;s eyes to be sure, when the substantial Pecksniff of his heart melted away into an idle dream!
I shall give your love to the friend, by the way.
Tom stepped from the little passage into the room from which these sounds proceeded, and had barely caught a glimpse of a gentleman in a dressing-gown and slippers (with his boots beside him ready to put on), sitting at his breakfast with a newspaper in his hand, when the said gentleman, at the imminent hazard of oversetting his tea-table, made a plunge at Tom, and hugged him.
I should scarcely have known you, my love, if I had seen you anywhere else, I declare!
I am going to try and settle myself in London; and if you are not happy here (as I very much fear you are not, for I begin to think you have been deceiving me with the kindest and most affectionate intention) you shall not remain here.&#39;
&#39;We will talk about it, Tom,&#39; said Ruth, giving him another kiss to pacify him.
&#39;Why then, you shall not, my love.
When they got back to the triangular parlour, and Tom&#39;s sister, bustling to and fro, busy about a thousand pleasant nothings, stopped every now and then to give old Tom a kiss or smile upon him, Tom rubbed his hands as if all Islington were his.
&#39;Is he married?&#39;
&#39;You are not married?&#39;
There was something hidden here, which piqued Tom&#39;s interest and troubled his tender heart.
If she had always been his kindest friend; if she had treated him through all his servitude with such consideration as was never yet received by struggling man; if she had lightened every moment of those many years, and had ever spared and never wounded him; his honest heart could not have swelled before her with a deeper pity, or a purer freedom from all base remembrance than it did then.
There was no love lost between us, Mr Pinch, at any time, I think.&#39;
she cried, in such a tone as rent Tom&#39;s heart.
Tell him that if he could know how my heart trembled in the balance that day, and what a very little would have turned the scale, his own would bleed with pity for me.&#39;
Tell him that I don&#39;t blame him, but am grateful for the effort that he made; but ask him for the love of God, and youth, and in merciful consideration for the struggle which an ill-advised and unwakened nature makes to hide the strength it thinks its weakness--ask him never, never, to forget this, when he deals with one again!&#39;
But though she comes here, constantly, to ease her poor full heart without his knowing it; and saying, &quot;Mrs Todgers, I am very low to-day; I think that I shall soon be dead,&quot; sits crying in my room until the fit is past; I know no more from her.
&#39;She&#39;s greatly altered since she&#39;s been Anoth--since she&#39;s been married, Mrs Todgers!&#39;
This was succeeded by some trifling love passages, which appeared to originate with, if not to be wholly carried on by Miss Pecksniff.
John Westlock, sitting in the cab, and, catching a glimpse of a blooming little busy creature darting out to kiss Tom and to help him with his box, would not have had the least objection to change places with him.
Although he never talked much, still, by being there among the regular customers, he made their acquaintance, and in course of time became quite intimate with Mr Tacker, Mr Mould&#39;s foreman; and even with Mr Mould himself, who openly said he was a long-headed man, a dry one, a salt fish, a deep file, a rasper; and made him the subject of many other flattering encomiums.
Tom lined out &#39;respectable young man, aged thirty-five;&#39; and sat looking on, pen in hand, with one of the most loving smiles imaginable.
Poor little Ruth was seized with a palpitation of the heart when Tom committed this appalling indiscretion, for she felt that if the dish turned out a failure, she never would be able to hold up her head before John Westlock again.
Ruth, my love!
&#39;Bless your heart,&#39; replied Tom, &#39;my poor father was of no consequence, nor my mother either.&#39;
There&#39;s nothing romantic in our history, John.&#39;
He led the way through sundry lanes and courts, into one more quiet and more gloomy than the rest, and, singling out a certain house, ascended a common staircase; taking from his pocket, as he went, a bunch of rusty keys.
John Westlock became quite absorbed in her fortunes; asking many questions of Tom Pinch about her marriage, inquiring whether her husband was the gentleman whom Tom had brought to dine with him at Salisbury; in what degree of relationship they stood towards each other, being different persons; and taking, in short, the greatest interest in the subject.
But not a word said Tom of what lay hidden in his heart; his heart, so deep, and true, and full of honour, and yet with so much room for every gentle and unselfish thought; not a word.
The man in all this world most confident in his sagacity and shrewdness; the man in all this world most proud of his distrust of other men, and having most to show in gold and silver as the gains belonging to his creed; the meekest favourer of that wise doctrine, Every man for himself, and God for us all (there being high wisdom in the thought that the Eternal Majesty of Heaven ever was, or can be, on the side of selfish lust and love!
); shall never find, oh, never find, be sure of that, the time come home to him, when all his wisdom is an idiot&#39;s folly, weighed against a simple heart!
During his business hours, he indulged himself occasionally with snatches of reading; which were often, indeed, a necessary part of his pursuit; and as he usually made bold to carry one of these goblin volumes home at night (always bringing it back again next morning, in case his strange employer should appear and ask what had become of it), he led a happy, quiet, studious kind of life, after his own heart.
Any footstep on the flags without set him listening attentively and when it turned into that house, and came up, up, up the stairs, he always thought with a beating heart, &#39;Now I am coming face to face with him at last!&#39;
As a good friend of mine has frequent made remark to me, which her name, my love, is Harris, Mrs Harris through the square and up the steps a-turnin&#39; round by the tobacker shop, &quot;Oh Sairey, Sairey, little do we know wot lays afore us!&quot;
But others is married, and in the marriage state; and there is a dear young creetur a-comin&#39; down this mornin&#39; to that very package, which is no more fit to trust herself to sea, than nothin&#39; is!&#39;
I have heerd of one young man, a guard upon a railway, only three years opened--well does Mrs Harris know him, which indeed he is her own relation by her sister&#39;s marriage with a master sawyer--as is godfather at this present time to six-and-twenty blessed little strangers, equally unexpected, and all on &#39;um named after the Ingeines as was the cause.
&#39;Sir, that man,&#39; replied the doctor, &#39;had been stabbed to the heart.
Had been stabbed to the heart with such dexterity, sir, that he had died instantly, and had bled internally.
The horses (they were travelling now with a single pair) plunged and started from the rills of quivering fire that seemed to wind along the ground before them; but there these two men sat, and forward they went as if they were led on by an invisible attraction.
On the other hand, he knew full well that Jonas had no reason to love him; and even taking the piece of pantomime which had so impressed his mind to be a real gesture, and not the working of his fancy, the most that could be said of it was, that it was quite in keeping with the rest of his diabolical fun, and had the same impotent expression of truth in it.
But the boy was past holding up, or being held up, or giving any other sign of life than a faint and fitful beating of the heart.
Her basket of needle-work stood unheeded at her elbow; her supper, spread on a round table not far off, was untasted; and the knives had been removed for fear of attraction.
It was impossible to help it--a ghost must have hugged her.
The Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea being, in that respect, all one, Martin hugged her instantly.
And still less that I shouldn&#39;t be angry with him, but should be glad with all my heart to be the first to welcome him home from America, with Mark Tapley for his--&#39; &#39;For his friend, Mrs Lupin,&#39; interposed Martin.
It smote him to the heart.
In his most selfish and most careless day, this lingering remnant of the old man&#39;s ancient love, this buttress of a ruined tower he had built up in the time gone by, with so much pride and hope, would have caused a pang in Martin&#39;s heart.
said the old man, stretching out his hand; &#39;and let me see what it is I used to love so dearly.&#39;
I have given you cause to think I have been driven here wholly by want, and have not been led on, in any degree, by affection or regret.
&#39;Upon that subject,&#39; said Martin, looking calmly at the old man as he spoke, but glancing once at Mary, whose face was now buried in her hands, upon the back of his easy-chair; &#39;upon that subject which first occasioned a division between us, my mind and heart are incapable of change.
But that I might have trusted to your love, if I had thrown myself manfully upon it; that I might have won you over with ease, if I had been more yielding and more considerate; that I should have best remembered myself in forgetting myself, and recollecting you; reflection, solitude, and misery, have taught me.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Mr Pecksniff murmured certain cheering expressions of sympathy and encouragement as they retired; and Martin, awakening from the stupor into which the closing portion of this scene had plunged him, to the opportunity afforded by their departure, caught the innocent cause of all in his embrace, and pressed her to his heart.
But tell me, love--for the few hasty words we can exchange now are precious--what is this which has been rumoured to me?
What former fancy or old habit survives in this, when his heart has turned so cold to you, is a mystery I cannot penetrate; but it has been, and it is, a happiness to me, that I remained true to him; that if he should wake from his delusion, even at the point of death, I am here, love, to recall you to his thoughts.&#39;
She herself had none; and yet he treated her with more affection than at any previous time.
&#39;Is he timid of asserting his own opinion in the presence of this infatuation?
A caution from Mr Tapley; a hasty interchange of farewells, and of something else which the proverb says must not be told of afterwards; a white hand held out to Mr Tapley himself, which he kissed with the devotion of a knight-errant; more farewells, more something else&#39;s; a parting word from Martin that he would write from London and would do great things there yet (Heaven knows what, but he quite believed it); and Mark and he stood on the outside of the Pecksniffian halls.
said Mr Pecksniff, inventing a playful little name for her, in the restored lightness of his heart.
You know she&#39;s got a sweetheart, I suppose?&#39;
cried Mr Pecksniff, much affected, &#39;I am not a diplomatical character; my heart is in my hand.
Otherwise, he muttered discontentedly, he would have seen his beloved father-in-law &#39;far enough off,&#39; before he would have taken him into his confidence.
Whether there was life enough left in the slow vegetation of Fountain Court for the smoky shrubs to have any consciousness of the brightest and purest-hearted little woman in the world, is a question for gardeners, and those who are learned in the loves of plants.
The Temple fountain might have leaped up twenty feet to greet the spring of hopeful maidenhood, that in her person stole on, sparkling, through the dry and dusty channels of the Law; the chirping sparrows, bred in Temple chinks and crannies, might have held their peace to listen to imaginary skylarks, as so fresh a little creature passed; the dingy boughs, unused to droop, otherwise than in their puny growth, might have bent down in a kindred gracefulness to shed their benedictions on her graceful head; old love letters, shut up in iron boxes in the neighbouring offices, and made of no account among the heaps of family papers into which they had strayed, and of which, in their degeneracy, they formed a part, might have stirred and fluttered with a moment&#39;s recollection of their ancient tenderness, as she went lightly by.
Anything might have happened that did not happen, and never will, for the love of Ruth.
Not for her love.
foolish, panting, frightened little heart, why did she run away!
Oh, foolish, panting, timid little heart, why did she feign to be unconscious of his coming!
Then why, whenever Ruth lifted up her eyes, did she let them fall again immediately, and seek the uncongenial pavement of the court?
Ah, foolish, panting, frightened little heart, how timidly she said it!
John Westlock added his entreaties with such earnestness that a flinty heart alone could have resisted them.
Hers was not a flinty heart.
So down she sat, and in a pleasant voice began to sing the ballads Tom loved well.
Tom took Ruth with him, not only because it was a great pleasure to him to have her for his companion whenever he could, but because he wished her to cherish and comfort poor Merry; which she, for her own part (having heard the wretched history of that young wife from Tom), was all eagerness to do.
&#39;For you women,&#39; said Tom, &#39;you women, my dear, are so kind, and in your kindness have such nice perception; you know so well how to be affectionate and full of solicitude without appearing to be; your gentleness of feeling is like your touch so light and easy, that the one enables you to deal with wounds of the mind as tenderly as the other enables you to deal with wounds of the body.
&#39;You ought to fall in love immediately.&#39;
&#39;Miss Pecksniff, and the young gentleman to whom she is going to be married.&#39;
&#39;Augustus, my love,&#39; said Miss Pecksniff, &#39;ask the price of the eight rosewood chairs, and the loo table.&#39;
And twice Miss Pecksniff kissed Miss Pinch upon the cheek.
&#39;Of course, my love,&#39; said Miss Pecksniff, &#39;it would be useless for me to disguise, after what you have seen, that I am about to be united to the gentleman who is walking with your brother.
I have blighted and withered the affections of his heart to that extent that he is not sure of me.
What are the reproaches of my conscience, when I see this in the man I love!&#39;
Ruth endeavoured to express some sense of her unbounded and flattering confidence; and presumed that she was going to be married soon.
In the same vein of confidence Miss Pecksniff ran through a general inventory of the articles that were already bought with the articles that remained to be purchased; what garments she intended to be married in, and where the ceremony was to be performed; and gave Miss Pinch, in short (as she told her), early and exclusive information on all points of interest connected with the event.
Harris had it done afore marriage at ten and six,&quot; she says, &quot;and wore it faithful next his heart till the colour run, when the money was declined to be give back, and no arrangement could be come to.
Poor Merry held the hand of cheerful little Ruth between her own, and listening with evident pleasure to all she said, but rarely speaking herself, sometimes smiled, and sometimes kissed her on the cheek, and sometimes turned aside to hide the tears that trembled in her eyes.
Tom felt this change in her so much, and was so glad to see how tenderly Ruth dealt with her, and how she knew and answered to it, that he had not the heart to make any movement towards their departure, although he had long since given utterance to all he came to say.
&#39;It all comes of this unfortunate marriage.
Augustus, my love, we will go, if you please.
Tom, nevertheless, persisting in his intention, and opening his lips to speak again, Jonas set upon him like a savage; and in the quickness and ferocity of his attack would have surely done him some grievous injury, defenceless as he was, and embarrassed by having his frightened sister clinging to his arm, if Merry had not run between them, crying to Tom for the love of Heaven to leave the house.
He looked towards her intently; and said, with a laboured distinctness, as if he had got the words off by heart: &#39;I have been travelling day and night, and am tired.
Do not break my heart too!&#39;
Mrs Gamp laid her hand upon her heart, to put some check upon its palpitations, and turning up her eyes replied in a faint voice: &#39;The awfulest things, Mr Chuzzlewit, as ever I heerd!
The door into the court had not been open for a long, long time; but the key had always hung in one place, and there it hung now.
Footsteps in the court!
Vistas of silence opened everywhere, into the heart and innermost recesses of the wood; beginning with the likeness of an aisle, a cloister, or a ruin open to the sky; then tangling off into a deep green rustling mystery, through which gnarled trunks, and twisted boughs, and ivy-covered stems, and trembling leaves, and bark-stripped bodies of old trees stretched out at length, were faintly seen in beautiful confusion.
But he was thinking, at the moment, of the closed-up room; of the possibility of their knocking at the door on some special occasion; of their being alarmed at receiving no answer; of their bursting it open; of their finding the room empty; of their fastening the door into the court, and rendering it impossible for him to get into the house without showing himself in the garb he wore, which would lead to rumour, rumour to detection, detection to death.
The raging thirst, the fire that burnt within him as he lay beneath the clothes, the augmented horror of the room when they shut it out from his view; the agony of listening, in which he paid enforced regard to every sound, and thought the most unlikely one the prelude to that knocking which should bring the news; the starts with which he left his couch, and looking in the glass, imagined that his deed was broadly written in his face, and lying down and burying himself once more beneath the blankets, heard his own heart beating Murder, Murder, Murder, in the bed; what words can paint tremendous truths like these!
EXHIBITS FILIAL PIETY IN AN UGLY ASPECT; AND CASTS A DOUBTFUL RAY OF LIGHT UPON A VERY DARK PLACE Tom Pinch and Ruth were sitting at their early breakfast, with the window open, and a row of the freshest little plants ranged before it on the inside by Ruth&#39;s own hands; and Ruth had fastened a sprig of geranium in Tom&#39;s button-hole, to make him very smart and summer-like for the day (it was obliged to be fastened in, or that dear old Tom was certain to lose it); and people were crying flowers up and down the street; and a blundering bee, who had got himself in between the two sashes of the window, was bruising his head against the glass, endeavouring to force himself out into the fine morning, and considering himself enchanted because he couldn&#39;t do it; and the morning was as fine a morning as ever was seen; and the fragrant air was kissing Ruth and rustling about Tom, as if it said, &#39;how are you, my dears; I came all this way on purpose to salute you;&#39; and it was one of those glad times when we form, or ought to form, the wish that every one on earth were able to be happy, and catching glimpses of the summer of the heart, to feel the beauty of the summer of the year.
Mr Chuzzlewit, my love.
Mark Tapley, my love, from the Dragon.
The blood retreated from his cheeks, and came rushing back, so violently, that it was pain to feel it; ease though, ease, compared with the aching of his wounded heart.
&#39;Then why on earth didn&#39;t you marry her at first, Mark, instead of wandering abroad, and losing all this time, and leaving her alone by herself, liable to be courted by other people?&#39;
Then all my hopeful wisions bein&#39; crushed; and findin&#39; that there ain&#39;t no credit for me nowhere; I abandons myself to despair, and says, &quot;Let me do that as has the least credit in it of all; marry a dear, sweet creetur, as is wery fond of me; me bein&#39;, at the same time, wery fond of her; lead a happy life, and struggle no more again&#39; the blight which settles on my prospects.&quot;&#39;
&#39;I wish you joy, Mark, with all my heart.
&#39;I grew into the knowledge of Tom,&#39; he pursued, &#39;as I grew towards manhood; and I have learned to love him as something, infinitely better than myself.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>He succeeded, after great trouble, in engaging two garrets for himself and Mark, situated in a court in the Strand, not far from Temple Bar.
&#39;Which, altering the name to Sairah Gamp; I drink,&#39; said Mrs Prig, &#39;with love and tenderness.&#39;
&#39;Which short it is, indeed,&#39; cried Mrs Gamp, turning up her languid eyes, and clasping Mr Westlock&#39;s wrist with matronly affection.
&#39;And I wouldn&#39;t, Tom,&#39; he said, with a little hesitation, &#39;I wouldn&#39;t have a shadow on her happy face, or an uneasy thought in her gentle heart, for all the wealth and honours of the universe!&#39;
When Tom was silent, looking out upon the summer weather, she would sometimes make a hasty movement, as if she were about to throw herself upon his neck; then check the impulse, and when he looked round, show a laughing face, and speak to him very merrily; when she had anything to give Tom, or had any excuse for coming near him, she would flutter about him, and lay her bashful hand upon his shoulder, and not be willing to withdraw it; and would show by all such means that there was something on her heart which in her great love she longed to say to him, but had not the courage to utter.
Was it worthy of what you used to be--of what I am sure you used to be--to tempt me, when you had turned against me, into pouring out my heart!
His tone was one of such strong injury and yet of so much grief for the loss of a friend he had trusted in--it expressed such high past love for Tom, and so much sorrow and compassion for his supposed unworthiness--that Tom, for a moment, put his hand before his face, and had no more power of justifying himself, than if he had been a monster of deceit and falsehood.
I swear, little as I showed it--little as I know I showed it--that when I had the least consideration for you, Tom, I loved you like a brother.&#39;
&#39;I think I never knew what it was to be sorry in my heart, until now.&#39;
I do not believe,&#39; said Martin, with emotion--&#39;hear me say it from my heart--I CANNOT believe, Tom, now that I am standing face to face with you, that it would have been in your nature to do me any serious harm, even though I had not discovered, by chance, in whose employment you were.
More closely yet, she nestled down about him; and wept as if her heart would break.
&#39;Oh Tom, dear Tom, I know your secret heart.
You love her, Tom, so dearly!&#39;
And still she hid her face from Tom, and clasped him round the neck, and wept for him, and poured out all her woman&#39;s heart and soul in the relief and pain of this disclosure.
Not because it assures me of your tender affection (for I was well assured of that before), but because it relieves my mind of a great weight.&#39;
Tom&#39;s eyes glistened when he spoke of her affection; and he kissed her on the cheek.
&#39;By her own choice and free consent, my love, she is betrothed to Martin; and was, long before either of them knew of my existence.
Do you think,&#39; said Tom, with a grave smile, &#39;that even if she had never seen him, it is very likely she would have fallen in love with Me?&#39;
&#39;You think of me, Ruth,&#39; said Tom, &#39;and it is very natural that you should, as if I were a character in a book; and you make it a sort of poetical justice that I should, by some impossible means or other, come, at last, to marry the person I love.
&#39;My dear,&#39; said Tom, &#39;I will repay your affection with the Truth and all the Truth.
Are my words to be harsh and my looks to be sour, and is my heart to grow cold, because there has fallen in my way a good and beautiful creature, who but for the selfish regret that I cannot call her my own, would, like all other good and beautiful creatures, make me happier and better!
&#39;Remembering all my means of happiness, I hardly dare to call this lurking something a sorrow; but whatever name it may justly bear, I thank Heaven that it renders me more sensible of affection and attachment, and softens me in fifty ways.
She could not speak to him, but she loved him, as he well deserved.
Even as he deserved, she loved him.
Tom little knew that there was that in Ruth&#39;s own heart, but newly set there, which had helped her to the reading of his mystery.
Indeed, she lightened the way (and Tom&#39;s heart with it) to that degree, that the Temple looked quite blank and solitary when he parted from her at the gate.
I have seen him offer love to Mary.
You know it; who better--who better, my true heart!
And you,&#39; he said to Chuffey, &#39;for the love of your old friend, speak out, good fellow!&#39;
&#39;I have been silent for his love!&#39;
Jonas heard this with a sinking heart.
He--he got up from his bed before he died, to be sure, to say that he forgave him; and he came down with me into this room; and when he saw him--his only son, the son he loved--his speech forsook him; he had no speech for what he knew--and no one understood him except me.
But his courage failed him or his heart was touched--my God!
I hope it was his heart!
He loved his only son, and he was always good to me!&#39;
He shall have it now; he shall marry where he has a fancy, Chuff, although it don&#39;t please me; and you and I will go away and live upon a little.
I always loved him; perhaps he&#39;ll love me then.
Once Mr Chuzzlewit, to try him, took heart to say it had a strange taste; and he got up directly, and went out.&#39;
&#39;Mr Chuzzlewit wrote to her father; I mean the father of the poor thing who&#39;s his wife,&#39; said Chuffey; &#39;and got him to come up, intending to hasten on the marriage.
But his mind, like mine, went a little wrong through grief, and then his heart broke.
But, standing at the door opposite, after dark that same night, I saw a countryman steal out of this house, by a side-door in the court, who had never entered it.
One of the men withdrew into the court.
&#39;My wishes, sir,&#39; replied Mr Tapley, whose mind would appear from the context to have been running on the matrimonial service, &#39;is to love, honour, and obey.
The old man went to meet them; took their hands in his; and kissed her on the cheek.
I have summoned you here to witness it, because I know the sight of everybody here must be a dagger in your mean, false heart!
Mary, my love, come here.&#39;
&#39;The curse of our house,&#39; said the old man, looking kindly down upon her, &#39;has been the love of self; has ever been the love of self.
I cannot find it in my heart to say that I am sorry for it now, or yonder fellow might be holding up his head.&#39;
Counting on the restoration of the love you knew I bore him, you designed him for one of your two daughters did ye?
Much as I loved you, I had that to acknowledge which I could not reconcile it to myself to avow, then, unless you made submission to me first.
Bless your heart, sir, there&#39;s ever so many Tiggs a-passin&#39; this here Temple-gate any hour in the day, that only want a chance to turn out full-blown Montagues every one!&#39;
And then he told them how he had sometimes thought, in the beginning, that love might grow up between Mary and Martin; and how he had pleased his fancy with the picture of observing it when it was new, and taking them to task, apart, in counterfeited doubt, and then confessing to them that it had been an object dear to his heart; and by his sympathy with them, and generous provision for their young fortunes, establishing a claim on their affection and regard which nothing should wither, and which should surround his old age with means of happiness.
How it was little comfort to him to know that Martin had chosen Her, because the grace of his design was lost, and because finding that she had returned his love, he tortured himself with the reflection that they, so young, to whom he had been so kind a benefactor, were already like the world, and bent on their own selfish, stealthy ends.
How he loved him still, and hoped he would return.
How on the night of his illness at the Dragon, he had secretly written tenderly of him, and made him his heir, and sanctioned his marriage with Mary; and how, after his interview with Mr Pecksniff, he had distrusted him again, and burnt the paper to ashes, and had lain down in his bed distracted by suspicions, doubts, and regrets.
And when he spoke of Tom, he said God bless him; and the tears were in his eyes; for he said that Tom, mistrusted and disliked by him at first, had come like summer rain upon his heart; and had disposed it to believe in better things.
And peace of mind, deep, tranquil peace of mind, was in Tom&#39;s heart.
&#39;Martin,&#39; he added, &#39;your rival has not been a dangerous one, but Mrs Lupin here has played duenna for some weeks; not so much to watch your love as to watch her lover.
But it was good in him that even then, in his high fortune and happiness, with her lips nearly printed on his own, and her proud young beauty in his close embrace, he had a hand still left to stretch out to Tom Pinch.
Several blows have been inflicted, sir, without a walking-stick, upon that tenderer portion of my frame--my heart.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&#39;Thank you, my love,&#39; said Mr Chuzzlewit.
With quite an earnest affection for it.
&#39;Martin will be married very soon now, I suppose?&#39;
Oh rapid, swelling, bursting little heart, you knew that it would come to this, and hoped it would.
Why beat so wildly, heart!
If I had loved you less, I could have told you that I loved you, long ago.
I have loved you from the first.
There never was a creature in the world more truly loved than you, dear Ruth, by me!&#39;
The gushing tears of joy, and pride, and hope, and innocent affection, would not be restrained.
Fresh from her full young heart they came to answer him.
&#39;My dear love!
I hope I know the value of your heart, I hope I know the worth of your angel nature.
The soft light touch fell coyly, but quite naturally, upon the lover&#39;s shoulder; the delicate waist, the drooping head, the blushing cheek, the beautiful eyes, the exquisite mouth itself, were all as natural as possible.
If Tom and we be not inseparable, and Tom (God bless him) have not all honour and all love in our home, my little wife, may that home never be!
In all simplicity and innocence and purity of heart, yet with a timid, graceful, half-determined hesitation, she set a little rosy seal upon the vow, whose colour was reflected in her face, and flashed up to the braiding of her dark brown hair.
Should I, John, love?&#39;
&#39;Do, my love,&#39; said John, &#39;whatever is natural to you on the impulse of the moment, and I am sure it will be right.&#39;
But when she saw his dear old face come in, her heart was so touched that she ran into his arms, and laid her head down on his breast and sobbed out, &#39;Bless me, Tom!
Health to wear them, my dear, and happiness to make you forgetful of them, except as a remembrance from a loving friend!&#39;
There are not many fathers who marry two such daughters on the same day; but we will overlook the improbability for the gratification of an old man&#39;s fancy.
Everybody drank to him, everybody looked to him, everybody thought of him, everybody loved him.
His heart was full, he said, of happiness.
Large as thy heart was, dear Tom Pinch, it had no room that day for anything but happiness and sympathy!
Oh, who could see her here, and not love her!
Who could ever stand possessed of such a heart as hers, and grow indifferent to the treasure!
Who could feel the rapture that I feel to-day, and love as I love her, Tom, without knowing something of her worth!
And oh, the look, the glorious, half-proud, half-timid look she gave Tom, when her lover drew her to his side!
&#39;I have told Tom, love, as we agreed, that we are not going to permit him to run away, and that we cannot possibly allow it.
Was their graceful love a folly, were their dear caresses follies, was their lengthened parting folly?
Was it folly in him to watch her window from the street, and rate its scantiest gleam of light above all diamonds; folly in her to breathe his name upon her knees, and pour out her pure heart before that Being from whom such hearts and such affections come?
She bore no spite nor malice in her heart.
That if the strong-minded women took that hand, in the temper in which it was extended to her, she, Miss Pecksniff, did invite her to be present at the ceremony of her marriage, and did furthermore invite the three red-nosed spinsters, her daughters (but Miss Pecksniff did not particularize their noses), to attend as bridesmaids.
&#39;It goes against my wishes to have it in progress just now, I assure you, sir,&#39; said Mrs Todgers; &#39;but Miss Pecksniff&#39;s mind was set upon it, and it really is time that Miss Pecksniff was married.
She kissed his hand again; and retaining it in hers, thanked him in a broken voice, for all his kindness to her since.
I never thought at all; dear Mr Chuzzlewit, I never thought at all; I had no thought, no heart, no care to find one; at that time.
&#39;I couldn&#39;t return to him,&#39; she said, with an instinctive reference to his having forced her marriage on.
She hurries on and publishes her marriage, in a spirit which (to say no more of it) is barely decent, is unsisterly, and bad.
&#39;You are to be married to-day!&#39;
You have chosen the period of your marriage unfortunately.&#39;
Lord love their welcome faces, don&#39;t I know &#39;em!&#39;
Away he went again, in a perfectly wild state, hugging them, and skipping round them, and cutting in between them, as if he were performing some frantic and outlandish dance.
But they came back with no other tidings than a familiar message from the clerk, importing that if they wanted to be married that morning they had better look sharp, as the curate wasn&#39;t going to wait there all day.
It would dispel the romance of the affair.&#39;
Frequently--when you have sought to soothe my brow with kisses--has self-destruction flashed across me.
&#39;I love another.
&#39;If you ever loved me, hear my last appeal!
But, in those sounds with which it is thy wont to bear the twilight company, the music of thy heart speaks out--the story of thy life relates itself.
In the soft strain which ever and again comes stealing back upon the ear, the memory of thine old love may find a voice perhaps; but it is a pleasant, softened, whispering memory, like that in which we sometimes hold the dead, and does not pain or grieve thee, God be thanked.
And there is one slight creature, Tom--her child; not Ruth&#39;s--whom thine eyes follow in the romp and dance; who, wondering sometimes to see thee look so thoughtful, runs to climb up on thy knee, and put her cheek to thine; who loves thee, Tom, above the rest, if that can be; and falling sick once, chose thee for her nurse, and never knew impatience, Tom, when thou wert by her side.
And coming from a garden, Tom, bestrewn with flowers by children&#39;s hands, thy sister, little Ruth, as light of foot and heart as in old days, sits down beside thee.

weir_of_hermiston:_an_unfinished_romance

It was a wonder to many that she had married--seeming so wholly of the stuff that makes old maids.
The acquaintance, which it seems profane to call a courtship, was pursued with Mr. Weir&#39;s accustomed industry, and was long a legend, or rather a source of legends, in the Parliament House.
and the profound accents of the suitor reply, &quot;Haangit, mem, haangit.&quot;
Being so trenchantly opposed to all she knew, loved, or understood, he may well have seemed to her the extreme, if scarcely the ideal, of his sex.
A little over forty at the period of his marriage, he looked already older, and to the force of manhood added the senatorial dignity of years; it was, perhaps, with an unreverend awe, but he was awful.
Perhaps half a dozen times in the history of his married life--&quot;Here!
A man who had no need either of love or of popularity, a keen reader of men and of events, there was perhaps only one truth for which he was quite unprepared: he would have been quite unprepared to learn that Kirstie hated him.
Her frosted sentiment bloomed again, she breathed deep of life, she let loose her heart, in that society.
_Persecutor_ was a word that knocked upon the woman&#39;s heart; it was her highest thought of wickedness, and the mark of it was on her house.
Perhaps none but Archie knew she could be eloquent; perhaps none but he had seen her--her colour raised, her hands clasped or quivering--glow with gentle ardour.
God was love; the name of my lord (to all who knew him) was fear.
It would break my heart to think that of you.
Kirstie took this decay of her mistress very hard; bore her a grudge, quarrelled with and railed upon her, the anxiety of a genuine love wearing the disguise of temper.
&quot;It was a daft-like marriage.&quot;
He had nothing to explain or to conceal; he sufficed wholly and silently to himself; and that part of our nature which goes out (too often with false coin) to acquire glory or love, seemed in him to be omitted.
He did not try to be loved, he did not care to be; it is probable the very thought of it was a stranger to his mind.
Once, a court holiday falling opportunely, my lord had his carriage, and drove the child himself to Hermiston, the customary place of convalescence.
The beautiful gentleness and grace of the old judge, and the delicacy of his person, thoughts, and language, spoke to Archie&#39;s heart in its own tongue.
&quot;You and he are so different,&quot; said the boy, his eyes dwelling on those of his old friend, like a lover&#39;s on his mistress&#39;s.
He has all the Roman virtues: Cato and Brutus were such; I think a son&#39;s heart might well be proud of such an ancestry of one.&quot;
Had he but talked--talked freely--let himself gush out in words (the way youth loves to do and should), there might have been no tale to write upon the Weirs of Hermiston.
He saw Holyrood in a dream, remembrance of its romance awoke in him and faded; he had a vision of the old radiant stories, of Queen Mary and Prince Charlie, of the hooded stag, of the splendour and crime, the velvet and bright iron of the past; and dismissed them with a cry of pain.
The two handsome lads followed the same course of study and recreation, and felt a certain mutual attraction, founded mainly on good looks.
He had never dreamed this sire of his, this aboriginal antique, this adamantine Adam, had even so much of a heart as to be moved in the least degree for another--and that other himself, who had insulted him!
Let an old man say it, for once, and not need to blush: I love you like a son.&quot;
And how do you think I love my father?&quot;
I do not love my father; I wonder sometimes if I do not hate him.
How was I to love him?
God guide you in the true way, and spare your days, and preserve to you your honest heart.&quot;
At that, he kissed the young man upon the forehead in a gracious, distant, antiquated way; and instantly launched, with a marked change of voice, into another subject.
He stepped back with a heart on fire, coldly and not ungracefully excused himself, and a little after watched her dancing with young Drumanno of the empty laugh, and was harrowed at the sight, and raged to himself that this was a world in which it was given to Drumanno to please, and to himself only to stand aside and envy.
She carried her thwarted ardours into housework, she washed floors with her empty heart.
If she could not win the love of one with love, she must dominate all by her temper.
To Kirstie, thus situate and in the Indian summer of her heart, which was slow to submit to age, the gods sent this equivocal good thing of Archie&#39;s presence.
A young man who should have so doted on the idea, moral and physical, of any woman, might be properly described as being in love, head and heels, and would have behaved himself accordingly.
But Kirstie--though her heart leaped at his coming footsteps--though, when he patted her shoulder, her face brightened for the day--had not a hope or thought beyond the present moment and its perpetuation to the end of time.
I have said her heart leaped--it is the accepted phrase.
This father was twice married, once to a dark woman of the old Ellwald stock, by whom he had Gilbert, presently of Cauldstaneslap; and, secondly, to the mother of Kirstie.
&quot;He was an auld man when he married her, a fell auld man wi&#39; a muckle voice--you could hear him rowting from the top o&#39; the Kye-skairs,&quot; she said; &quot;but for her, it appears she was a perfit wonder.
But, as I was sayin&#39;, my mither--&quot; On the death of the father there remained golden-haired Kirstie, who took service with her distant kinsfolk, the Rutherfords, and black-a-vised Gilbert, twenty years older, who farmed the Cauldstaneslap, married, and begot four sons between 1773 and 1784, and a daughter, like a postscript, in &#39;97, the year of Camperdown and Cape St. Vincent.
He had never been loved, but he had been feared in honour.
He was married, and, by reason of the effulgence of that legendary night, was adored by his wife.
There was an exaltation in his nature which had led him to embrace with enthusiasm the principles of the French Revolution, and had ended by bringing him under the hawse of my Lord Hermiston in that furious onslaught of his upon the Liberals, which sent Muir and Palmer into exile and dashed the party into chaff.
The gaunt weaver was dry-nurse at Cauldstaneslap, and the bairns loved him dearly.
He too had married, and was rearing a plentiful family in the smoke and din of Glasgow; he was wealthy, and could have bought out his brother, the cock-laird, six times over, it was whispered; and when he slipped away to Cauldstaneslap for a well-earned holiday, which he did as often as he was able, he astonished the neighbours with his broadcloth, his beaver hat, and the ample plies of his neckcloth.
He loved money well enough, knew very well how to spend it, and could make a shrewd bargain when he liked.
His &quot;Hermiston Burn,&quot; with its pretty refrain-- &quot;I love to gang thinking whaur ye gang linking, Hermiston burn, in the howe;&quot; his &quot;Auld, auld Elliotts, clay-cauld Elliotts, dour, bauld Elliotts of auld,&quot; and his really fascinating piece about the Praying Weaver&#39;s Stone, had gained him in the neighbourhood the reputation, still possible in Scotland, of a local bard; and, though not printed himself, he was recognised by others who were and who had become famous.
Behind her, the whole Cauldstaneslap contingent marched in closer order, and with an indescribable air of being in the presence of the foe; and while Dandie saluted his aunt with a certain familiarity as of one who was well in court, Hob marched on in awful immobility.
He knew besides they were like other men; below the crust of custom, rapture found a way; he had heard them beat the timbrel before Bacchus--had heard them shout and carouse over their whisky-toddy; and not the most Dutch-bottomed and severe faces among them all, not even the solemn elders themselves, but were capable of singular gambols at the voice of love.
His heart perhaps beat in time to some vast indwelling rhythm of the universe.
At that her heart beat the least thing in the world; and she proceeded, by way of a corrective, to call up and dismiss a series of fancied pictures of the young man who should now, by rights, be looking at her.
she thought, and her heart swelled.
Shame bowed him down, and he looked resolutely at Mr. Torrance; who little supposed, good, worthy man, as he continued to expound justification by faith, what was his true business: to play the part of derivative to a pair of children at the old game of falling in love.
When she had overtaken the stragglers of her family, she caught up the niece whom she had so recently repulsed, and kissed and slapped her, and drove her away again, and ran after her with pretty cries and laughter.
She was in love with herself, her destiny, the air of the hills, the benediction of the sun.
Archie&#39;s image, on the other hand, when it presented itself was never welcomed--far less welcomed with any ardour, and it was exposed at times to merciless criticism.
Thus even that phenomenon of love at first sight, which is so rare and seems so simple and violent, like a disruption of life&#39;s tissue, may be decomposed into a sequence of accidents happily concurring.
&quot;Will ye no gie&#39;s a kiss, Dand?&quot;
He kissed her and considered her a moment; he found something strange in her.
That was Dandie&#39;s way; a kiss and a comfit to Jenny--a bawbee and my blessing to Jill--and goodnight to the whole clan of ye, my dears!
For the steps of love in the young, and especially in girls, are instinctive and unconscious.
He had a certain delicacy which had preserved him hitherto unspotted, and which (had either of them guessed it) made him a more dangerous companion when his heart should be really stirred.
We are here for so short a time; and all the old people before us--Rutherfords of Hermiston, Elliotts of the Cauldstaneslap--that were here but a while since riding about and keeping up a great noise in this quiet corner--making love too, and marrying--why, where are they now?
When it was done, she turned upon Archie a face softly bright, and eyes gently suffused and shining in the twilight, and his heart rose and went out to her with boundless pity and sympathy.
She was a human being tuned to a sense of the tragedy of life; there were pathos and music and a great heart in the girl.
In the falling greyness of the evening he watched her figure winding through the morass, saw it turn a last time and wave a hand, and then pass through the Slap; and it seemed to him as if something went along with her out of the deepest of his heart.
All night she seemed to be conveyed smoothly upon a shallow stream of sleep and waking, and through the bowers of Beulah; all night she cherished to her heart that exquisite hope; and if, towards morning, she forgot it a while in a more profound unconsciousness, it was to catch again the rainbow thought with her first moment of awaking.
For Archie they had, one and all, a sensitive affection and respect which recoiled from a word of belittlement.
Frank was made welcome there at once, continued to go regularly, and had attended a meeting (as the members ever after loved to tell) on the evening before his death.
And if a man but talks of himself in the right spirit, refers to his virtuous actions by the way, and never applies to them the name of virtue, how easily his evidence is accepted in the court of public opinion!
The son of a hunks, he was still a hunks at heart, incapable of true generosity and consideration; but he had other qualities with which Frank could divert himself in the meanwhile, and to enjoy which it was necessary that Frank should keep his temper.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>But with the end of the conversation, when the voice stops and the bright face of the listener is turned away, solitude falls again on the bruised heart.
For, with the clairvoyance of a genuine love, she had pierced the mystery that had so long embarrassed Frank.
Anon, with a revulsion, her temper raged to see such utmost favours of fortune and love squandered on a brat of a girl, one of her own house, using her own name--a deadly ingredient--and that &quot;didna ken her ain mind an&#39; was as black&#39;s your hat.&quot;
Now she trembled lest her deity should plead in vain, loving the idea of success for him like a triumph of nature; anon, with returning loyalty to her own family and sex, she trembled for Kirstie and the credit of the Elliotts.
And again she had a vision of herself, the day over for her old-world tales and local gossip, bidding farewell to her last link with life and brightness and love; and behind and beyond, she saw but the blank butt-end where she must crawl to die.
she, so great, so beautiful, with a heart as fresh as a girl&#39;s and strong as womanhood?
She sat up with her heart beating.
She rose, all woman, and all the best of woman, tender, pitiful, hating the wrong, loyal to her own sex--and all the weakest of that dear miscellany, nourishing, cherishing next her soft heart, voicelessly flattering, hopes that she would have died sooner than have acknowledged.
&quot;It&#39;s ill to blend the eyes of love.
He came towards her slowly from the window, took up her hand in his and kissed it.
Excuse a daft wife that loves ye, and that kenned your mither.
And for His name&#39;s sake keep yersel&#39; frae inordinate desires; haud your heart in baith your hands, carry it canny and laigh; dinna send it up like a hairn&#39;s kite into the collieshangic o&#39; the wunds!
Archie&#39;s slow pace was quickened; his legs hasted to her though his heart was hanging back.
The revulsion of feeling in Christina&#39;s heart was violent.
In her quick petulant nature, a moment ago on fire with hope, thwarted love and wounded vanity wrought.
He had passed a night of sermons, a day of reflection; he had come wound up to do his duty; and the set mouth, which in him only betrayed the effort of his will, to her seemed the expression of an averted heart.
&quot;And what kind o&#39; love do ye ca&#39; that, that&#39;s ready to gang round like a whirligig at folk talking?
It is not to be supposed that, during so many days with a love avowed between them, some reference had not been made to their conjoint future.
Kirstie had wilfully closed the eye of thought; she would not argue even with herself; gallant, desperate little heart, she had accepted the command of that supreme attraction like the call of fate and marched blindfold on her doom.
Again and again he had touched on marriage; again and again been driven back into indistinctness by a memory of Lord Hermiston.
And Kirstie had been swift to understand and quick to choke down and smother the understanding; swift to leap up in flame at a mention of that hope, which spoke volumes to her vanity and her love, that she might one day be Mrs. Weir of Hermiston; swift, also, to recognise in his stumbling or throttled utterance the death-knell of these expectations, and constant, poor girl!
But these unfinished references, these blinks in which his heart spoke, and his memory and reason rose up to silence it before the words were well uttered, gave her unqualifiable agony.
So now again, at the mere wind of its coming, at the mere mention of his father&#39;s name--who might seem indeed to have accompanied them in their whole moorland courtship, an awful figure in a wig with an ironical and bitter smile, present to guilty consciousness--she fled from it head down.
If I canna get love, I&#39;ll have respect, Mr. Weir.
It seemed unprovoked, a wilful convulsion of brute nature. . . . EDITORIAL NOTE With the words last printed, &quot;a wilful convulsion of brute nature,&quot; the romance of _Weir of Hermiston_ breaks off.
Taking advantage of the situation thus created, and of the girl&#39;s unhappiness and wounded vanity, Frank Innes pursues his purpose of seduction; and Kirstie, though still caring for Archie in her heart, allows herself to become Frank&#39;s victim.
He does not at once deny the charge, but seeks out and questions young Kirstie, who confesses the truth to him; and he, still loving her, promises to protect and defend her in her trouble.
It seems certain, however, that the next stage in the relations of Archie and the younger Kirstie would have been as above foreshadowed; and this conception of the lover&#39;s unconventional chivalry and unshaken devotion to his mistress after her fault is very characteristic of the writer&#39;s mind.
You let yourself fall in love with, and fondle, and smile at your puppets.
Again, the case of a judge involved by the exigencies of his office in a strong conflict between public duty and private interest or affection, was one which had always attracted and exercised Stevenson&#39;s imagination.
Once more, the difficulties often attending the relation of father and son in actual life had pressed heavily on Stevenson&#39;s mind and conscience from the days of his youth, when in obeying the law of his own nature he had been constrained to disappoint, distress, and for a time to be much misunderstood by, a father whom he justly loved and admired with all his heart.
The several elements above noted having been left to work for many years in his mind, it was in the autumn of 1892 that he was moved to &quot;take the lid off and look in,&quot;--under the influence, it would seem, of a special and overmastering wave of that feeling for the romance of Scottish scenery and character which was at all times so strong in him, and which his exile did so much to intensify.
With this country also holiday rides and excursions from Peebles had made him familiar as a boy: and this seems certainly the most natural scene of the story, if only from its proximity to the proper home of the Elliotts, which of course is in the heart of the Border, especially Teviotdale and Ettrick.
Surely no son of Scotland has died leaving with his last breath a worthier tribute to the land he loved.
Jo, sweetheart.
Macers, offiers of the supreme court.
Session, the Court of Session, the supreme court of Scotland.

sunday_under_three_heads

There are many grave old persons, I know, who shake their heads with an air of profound wisdom, and tell you that poor people dress too well now-a-days; that when they were children, folks knew their stations in life better; that you may depend upon it, no good will come of this sort of thing in the end,—and so forth: but I fancy I can discern in the fine bonnet of the working-man’s wife, or the feather-bedizened hat of his child, no inconsiderable evidence of good feeling on the part of the man himself, and an affectionate desire to expend the few shillings he can spare from his week’s wages, in improving the appearance and adding to the happiness of those who are nearest and dearest to him.
I would to God, that the iron-hearted man who would deprive such people as these of their only pleasures, could feel the sinking of heart and soul, the wasting exhaustion of mind and body, the utter prostration of present strength and future hope, attendant upon that incessant toil which lasts from day to day, and from month to month; that toil which is too often protracted until the silence of midnight, and resumed with the first stir of morning.
Abandoned by the world, having nothing to fall back upon, nothing to remember but time mis-spent, and energies misdirected, they turn their eyes and not their thoughts to Heaven, and delude themselves into the impious belief, that in denouncing the lightness of heart of which they cannot partake, and the rational pleasures from which they never derived enjoyment, they are more than remedying the sins of their old career, and—like the founders of monasteries and builders of churches, in ruder days—establishing a good set claim upon their Maker.
Occasionally I passed an aged couple, whose married daughter and her husband were loitering by the side of the old people, accommodating their rate of walking to their feeble pace, while a little knot of children hurried on before; stout young labourers in clean round frocks; and buxom girls with healthy, laughing faces, were plentifully sprinkled about in couples, and the whole scene was one of quiet and tranquil contentment, irresistibly captivating.

As the patron Saint has her attitude and accessories in mediaeval illumination, so the sweetheart may be said to have hers upon the table of her true Love’s fancy, without which she is rarely introduced there except by effort; and this though she may, on further acquaintance, have been observed in many other phases which one would imagine to be far more appropriate to love’s young dream.
Then comes a rapid look into Stephen’s face, and a still more rapid look back again to her business, her face having dropped its sadness, and acquired a certain expression of mischievous archness the while; which lingered there for some time, but was never developed into a positive smile of flirtation.
Well, men of another kind, when I get them to be honest enough to own the truth, think just the reverse: that my life must be a dreadful bore in its normal state, though pleasant for the exceptional few days they pass here.” “I could live here always!” he said, and with such a tone and look of unconscious revelation that Elfride was startled to find that her harmonies had fired a small Troy, in the shape of Stephen’s heart.
Oh, papa is so funny in some things!” Then, after this childish burst of confidence, she was frightened, as if warned by womanly instinct, which for the moment her ardour had outrun, that she had been too forward to a comparative stranger.
“Anybody would think he was in love with that horrid mason instead of with——” The sentence remained unspoken, though not unthought.
The long-armed trees and shrubs of juniper, cedar, and pine varieties, were grayish black; those of the broad-leaved sort, together with the herbage, were grayish-green; the eternal hills and tower behind them were grayish-brown; the sky, dropping behind all, gray of the purest melancholy.
They are notes for a romance I am writing.” She could not help colouring at the confession, much as she tried to avoid it.
“Yes; THE COURT OF KELLYON CASTLE; a romance of the fifteenth century.
Such writing is out of date now, I know; but I like doing it.” “A romance carried in a purse!
The real reason is, that I mostly write bits of it on scraps of paper when I am on horseback; and I put them there for convenience.” “What are you going to do with your romance when you have written it?” said Stephen.
Driving through an ancient gate-way of dun-coloured stone, spanned by the high-shouldered Tudor arch, they found themselves in a spacious court, closed by a facade on each of its three sides.
In the corners of the court polygonal bays, whose surfaces were entirely occupied by buttresses and windows, broke into the squareness of the enclosure; and a far-projecting oriel, springing from a fantastic series of mouldings, overhung the archway of the chief entrance to the house.
It had now become an established rule, that whenever she met them—indoors or out-of-doors, weekdays or Sundays—they were to be severally pressed against her face and bosom for the space of a quarter of a minute, and other-wise made much of on the delightful system of cumulative epithet and caress to which unpractised girls will occasionally abandon themselves.
As Elfride did not stand on a sufficiently intimate footing with the object of her interest to justify her, as a proper young lady, to commence the active search for him that youthful impulsiveness prompted, and as, nevertheless, for a nascent reason connected with those divinely cut lips of his, she did not like him to be absent from her side, she wandered desultorily back to the oak staircase, pouting and casting her eyes about in hope of discerning his boyish figure.
Did he then kiss her?
Yet the motion might have been a kiss.
No more pleasure came in recognizing that from liking to attract him she was getting on to love him, boyish as he was and innocent as he had seemed.
Her callow heart made an epoch of the incident; she considered her array of feelings, for and against.
“No, thank you, Mr. Smith; I can get along better by myself” It was Elfride’s first fragile attempt at browbeating a lover.
Elfride had fidgeted all night in her little bed lest none of the household should be awake soon enough to start him, and also lest she might miss seeing again the bright eyes and curly hair, to which their owner’s possession of a hidden mystery added a deeper tinge of romance.
Chapter VII “No more of me you knew, my love!” Stephen Smith revisited Endelstow Vicarage, agreeably to his promise.
In the evening, when twenty-four hours of Elfride had completely rekindled her admirer’s ardour, a game of chess was proposed between them.
His heart was throbbing even more excitedly than was hers, which itself had quickened when she seriously set to work on this last occasion.
O Miss Swancourt!” he burst out wildly, his heart swelling in his throat, “I must tell you how I love you!
So entirely new was full-blown love to Elfride, that she trembled as much from the novelty of the emotion as from the emotion itself.
“You must not begin such things as those,” she said with coquettish hauteur of a very transparent nature “And—you must not do so again—and papa is coming.” “Let me kiss you—only a little one,” he said with his usual delicacy, and without reading the factitiousness of her manner.
“‘And sure in language strange she said, I love thee true.’” “Not at all,” she rejoined quickly.
You may kiss my hand if you like.” He expressed by a look that to kiss a hand through a glove, and that a riding-glove, was not a great treat under the circumstances.
Ah, you don’t want to kiss it, and you shall not now!” “If I do not, may I never kiss again, you severe Elfride!
She was ruling a heart with absolute despotism for the first time in her life.
I wanted to imprint a sweet—serious kiss upon your hand; and that’s all.” “Now, that’s creeping round again!
He does not think of it at all.” “Darling Elfie, I wish we could be married!
Do you love me deeply, deeply?” “No!” she said in a fluster.
“I didn’t mean to stop you quite,” she faltered with some alarm; and seeing that he still remained silent, she added more anxiously, “If you say that again, perhaps, I will not be quite—quite so obstinate—if—if you don’t like me to be.” “Oh, my Elfride!” he exclaimed, and kissed her.
It was Elfride’s first kiss.
A woman must have had many kisses before she kisses well.
Well, there were no such facilities now; and Stephen was conscious of it—first with a momentary regret that his kiss should be spoilt by her confused receipt of it, and then with the pleasant perception that her awkwardness was her charm.
“And you do care for me and love me?” said he.
“There is a reason why, my Elfride.” “Not any one that I know of.” “Suppose there is something connected with me which makes it almost impossible for you to agree to be my wife, or for your father to countenance such an idea?” “Nothing shall make me cease to love you: no blemish can be found upon your personal nature.
As the lover’s world goes, this is a great deal.
I couldn’t think so OLD as that, try how I might....And no lover has ever kissed you before?” “Never.” “I knew that; you were so unused.
You ride well, but you don’t kiss nicely at all; and I was told once, by my friend Knight, that that is an excellent fault in woman.” “Now, come; I must mount again, or we shall not be home by dinner-time.” And they returned to where Pansy stood tethered.
“What did you love me for?” she said, after a long musing look at a flying bird.
What did you love me for?” “It might have been for your mouth?” “Well, what about my mouth?” “I thought it was a passable mouth enough——” “That’s not very comforting.” “With a pretty pout and sweet lips; but actually, nothing more than what everybody has.” “Don’t make up things out of your head as you go on, there’s a dear Stephen.
But I am not altogether sure.” “Ah, that’s pretty to say; but I don’t care for your love, if it made a mere flat picture of me in that way, and not being sure, and such cold reasoning; but what you FELT I was, you know, Stephen” (at this a stealthy laugh and frisky look into his face), “when you said to yourself, ‘I’ll certainly love that young lady.’” “I never said it.” “When you said to yourself, then, ‘I never will love that young lady.’” “I didn’t say that, either.” “Then was it, ‘I suppose I must love that young lady?’” “No.” “What, then?” “’Twas much more fluctuating—not so definite.” “Tell me; do, do.” “It was that I ought not to think about you if I loved you truly.” “Ah, that I don’t understand.
And I’ll not ask you ever any more—never more—to say out of the deep reality of your heart what you loved me for.” “Sweet tantalizer, what’s the use?
It comes to this sole simple thing: That at one time I had never seen you, and I didn’t love you; that then I saw you, and I did love you.
Is that enough?” “Yes; I will make it do....I know, I think, what I love you for.
It is because you are so docile and gentle.” “Those are not quite the correct qualities for a man to be loved for,” said Stephen, in rather a dissatisfied tone of self-criticism.
I shall try to be his intimate friend some day.” “But aren’t you now?” “No; not so much as that,” replied Stephen, as if such a supposition were extravagant.
“You see, it was in this way—he came originally from the same place as I, and taught me things; but I am not intimate with him.
But I do like him, and he deserves even more affection from me than I give.” “You are not nice now, and you make me as jealous as possible!” she exclaimed perversely.
You think of him night and day, ever so much more than of anybody else; and when you are thinking of him, I am shut out of your mind.” “No, dear Elfride; I love you dearly.” “And I don’t like you to tell me so warmly about him when you are in the middle of loving me.
You would save him, and let me drown, drown, drown; and I don’t care about your love!” She had endeavoured to give a playful tone to her words, but the latter speech was rather forced in its gaiety.
Come, or you don’t love me!” she teasingly went on.
She was vividly imagining, for the twentieth time, the kiss of the morning, and putting her lips together in the position another such a one would demand, when she heard the identical operation performed on the lawn, immediately beneath her window.
The kissing pair might have been behind some of these; at any rate, nobody was in sight.
Had no enigma ever been connected with her lover by his hints and absences, Elfride would never have thought of admitting into her mind a suspicion that he might be concerned in the foregoing enactment.
But the reservations he at present insisted on, while they added to the mystery without which perhaps she would never have seriously loved him at all, were calculated to nourish doubts of all kinds, and with a slow flush of jealousy she asked herself, might he not be the culprit?
“Has your trouble anything to do with a kiss on the lawn?” she asked abruptly, almost passionately.
I certainly have kissed nobody on the lawn, if that is really what you want to know, Elfride.” “You know nothing about such a performance?” “Nothing whatever.
“I want him to know we love, Stephen.
“Elfie, will you love me, in spite of everything that may be said against me?” “O Stephen, what makes you repeat that so continually and so sadly?
Well, I love you just as much, Stephen, dear Stephen,” she murmured tenderly, “I do indeed.
“She continued to attend to a dairy long after my father married her,” pursued Stephen, without further hesitation.
And so THIS is what your trouble was?” “I thought I was doing wrong in letting you love me without telling you my story; and yet I feared to do so, Elfie.
Having seen your face, my darling, I had not heart to contradict him, and tell him what would have cut me off from a friendly knowledge of you.” She sighed deeply.
Why need we be so alarmed?” “And Elfie,” said Stephen, his hopes kindling with hers, “Knight thinks nothing of my being only a cottager’s son; he says I am as worthy of his friendship as if I were a lord’s; and if I am worthy of his friendship, I am worthy of you, am I not, Elfride?” “I not only have never loved anybody but you,” she said, instead of giving an answer, “but I have not even formed a strong friendship, such as you have for Knight.
“And had you really never any sweetheart at all?” “None that was ever recognized by me as such.” “But did nobody ever love you?” “Yes—a man did once; very much, he said.” “How long ago?” “Oh, a long time.” “How long, dearest?
“I said long, not very long.” “And did he want to marry you?” “I believe he did.
He was not good enough, even if I had loved him.” “May I ask what he was?” “A farmer.” “A farmer not good enough—how much better than my family!” Stephen murmured.
I don’t like standing by HIM, even if you never loved him.
Elfride had now resigned herself to the overwhelming idea of her lover’s sorry antecedents; Stephen had not forgotten the trifling grievance that Elfride had known earlier admiration than his own.
“Stephen, I love only you,” she tremulously whispered.
They entered, each with a demeanour intended to conceal the inconcealable fact that reciprocal love was their dominant chord.
“No man is fair in love;” and he took her fingers lightly in his own.
We are not in a hurry, dear papa; we don’t want in the least to marry now; not until he is richer.
Only will you let us be engaged, because I love him so, and he loves me?” Mr. Swancourt’s feelings were a little touched by this appeal, and he was annoyed that such should be the case.
He loved me too well to like to run the risk.
Who can blame him for trying, by any means, to stay near me—the girl he loves?
All is fair in love.
For of all the miseries attaching to miserable love, the worst is the misery of thinking that the passion which is the cause of them all may cease.
Why, to marry her would be the great blessing of my life—socially and practically, as well as in other respects.
“Every woman now-a-days,” resumed Mrs. Smith, “if she marry at all, must expect a father-in-law of a rank lower than her father.
“I don’t read the papers for nothing, and I know men all move up a stage by marriage.
Men of her class, that is, parsons, marry squires’ daughters; squires marry lords’ daughters; lords marry dukes’ daughters; dukes marry queens’ daughters.
All stages of gentlemen mate a stage higher; and the lowest stage of gentlewomen are left single, or marry out of their class.” “But you said just now, dear mother——” retorted Stephen, unable to resist the temptation of showing his mother her inconsistency.
So you are in her class, but ’tis what HER people would CALL marrying out of her class.
“I’m sure,” added Mrs. Smith in a more philosophic tone, and as a terminative speech, “if there’d been so much trouble to get a husband in my time as there is in these days—when you must make a god-almighty of a man to get en to hae ye—I’d have trod clay for bricks before I’d ever have lowered my dignity to marry, or there’s no bread in nine loaves.” The discussion now dropped, and as it was getting late, Stephen bade his parents farewell for the evening, his mother none the less warmly for their sparring; for although Mrs. Smith and Stephen were always contending, they were never at enmity.
His thoughts were, that should the vicar permit him to become engaged, to hope for an engagement, or in any way to think of his beloved Elfride, he might stay longer.
Instead of lying down she sat again in the darkness without closing the door, and listened with a beating heart to every sound from downstairs.
The door was left open, and she found that the meal, such as it was, passed off between her father and her lover without any remark, save commonplaces as to cucumbers and melons, their wholesomeness and culture, uttered in a stiff and formal way.
When she had placed the candle on the table, he enclosed her with his arms, dried her eyes with his handkerchief, and kissed their lids.
“Stephen, it is over—happy love is over; and there is no more sunshine now!” “I will make a fortune, and come to you, and have you.
For, remember, your love for me must be nourished in secret; there will be no long visits from me to support you.
And there will be a vacancy in your heart, and some others will be let in.” “I could not, I would not.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Mr. Swancourt would have to revoke his formidable words before the waiting for marriage could even set in.
“I wish we could marry now,” murmured Stephen, as an impossible fancy.
“To marry and part secretly, and live on as we are living now; merely to put it out of anybody’s power to force you away from me, dearest.” “Or you away from me, Stephen.” “Or me from you.
It is possible to conceive a force of circumstance strong enough to make any woman in the world marry against her will: no conceivable pressure, up to torture or starvation, can make a woman once married to her lover anybody else’s wife.” Now up to this point the idea of an immediate secret marriage had been held by both as an untenable hypothesis, wherewith simply to beguile a miserable moment.
The perception was that an immediate marriage COULD be contrived; the conviction that such an act, in spite of its daring, its fathomless results, its deceptiveness, would be preferred by each to the life they must lead under any other conditions.
think of it; think of it!” It is certain that the young girl’s love for Stephen received a fanning from her father’s opposition which made it blaze with a dozen times the intensity it would have exhibited if left alone.
All the elements of such a development were there, the chief one being hopelessness—a necessary ingredient always to perfect the mixture of feelings united under the name of loving to distraction.
He would then be convinced that hearts cannot be played with; love encouraged be ready to grow, love discouraged be ready to die, at a moment’s notice.
Stephen took a cup of coffee, left the house of his love, and turned into the lane.
It was a good opportunity; and since the dismissal of Stephen her father had been generally in a mood to make small concessions, that he might steer clear of large ones connected with that outcast lover of hers.
Fifteen days—that fragment of duration which has acquired such an interesting individuality from its connection with the English marriage law.
Thus brought round to the youth again, she saw him in her fancy, standing, touching her, his eyes full of sad affection, hopelessly renouncing his attempt because she had renounced hers; and she could not recede.
She had resolved to let her father see the arrival of this one, be the consequences what they might: the dread of losing her lover by this deed of honesty prevented her acting upon the resolve.
Given an impulsive inconsequent girl, neglected as to her inner life by her only parent, and the following forces alive within her; to determine a resultant: First love acted upon by a deadly fear of separation from its object: inexperience, guiding onward a frantic wish to prevent the above-named issue: misgivings as to propriety, met by hope of ultimate exoneration: indignation at parental inconsistency in first encouraging, then forbidding: a chilling sense of disobedience, overpowered by a conscientious inability to brook a breaking of plighted faith with a man who, in essentials, had remained unaltered from the beginning: a blessed hope that opposition would turn an erroneous judgement: a bright faith that things would mend thereby, and wind up well.
After this expression, she said to him suddenly: “If Mr. Smith had been already in the family, you would not have been made wretched by discovering he had poor relations?” “Do you mean in the family by marriage?” he replied inattentively, and continuing to peel his egg.
On one side of her, three volumes of fiction lay kissing the mud; on the other numerous skeins of polychromatic wools lay absorbing it.
Elfride’s heart throbbed erratically, and she thought, “Horses, if left to themselves, make for where they are best fed.
So strangely involved are motives that, more than by her promise to Stephen, more even than by her love, she was forced on by a sense of the necessity of keeping faith with herself, as promised in the inane vow of ten minutes ago.
“We cannot be married here to-day, my Elfie!
“There’s only one thing we can do, darling.” “What’s that?” “Go on to London by a train just starting, and be married there to-morrow.” “Passengers for the 11.5 up-train take their seats!” said a guard’s voice on the platform.
“Never to have started, or not to have returned without being married.
I shall be your husband sooner or later, for certain, and so prove your purity.” “Stephen, once in London I ought to have married you,” she said firmly.
That woman’s eyes have eaten my heart away!” “You are wild; and you grieve me, darling.
At length she came trotting round to him, in appearance much as on the romantic morning of their visit to the cliff, but shorn of the radiance which glistened about her then.
Do you think I could marry another man on earth after having gone thus far with you?
Have I not irretrievably committed myself?—pride has stood for nothing in the face of my great love.
Be assured of this, that whenever you have a home for me—however poor and humble—and come and claim me, I am ready.” She added bitterly, “When my father knows of this day’s work, he may be only too glad to let me go.” “Perhaps he may, then, insist upon our marriage at once!” Stephen answered, seeing a ray of hope in the very focus of her remorse.
If he says, marry now, so much the better.
Say I have nothing to offer him in exchange for his treasure—the more sorry I; but all the love, and all the life, and all the labour of an honest man shall be yours.
I hope you got on well?” Elfride’s heart smote her, and she did not speak.
I went to be married!” “Married!” she faltered, and could hardly check an involuntary “So did I.” A moment after and her resolve to confess perished like a bubble.
Elfride, I am past love, you know, and I honestly confess that I married her for your sake.
With your good looks, if you now play your cards well, you may marry anybody.
“I courted her through the privet hedge yonder: not entirely, you know, but we used to walk there of an evening—nearly every evening at last.
“Did you kiss Mrs. Troyton on the lawn about three weeks ago?
“Here, Charlotte, is my little Elfride,” said Mr. Swancourt, with the increased affection of tone often adopted towards relations when newly produced.
Mrs. Swancourt moved forward, took her step-daughter’s hand, then kissed her.
Mrs. Swancourt was a woman of the world as to knowledge, the reverse as to action, as her marriage suggested.
Now, then, what is it about, dear?” “About—well, it is a romance of the Middle Ages.” “Knowing nothing of the present age, which everybody knows about, for safety you chose an age known neither to you nor other people.
A mere commonplace creature like me will soon be turned out again.” “Oh no; once you are there you’ll be like a drop of water in a piece of rock-crystal—your medium will dignify your commonness.” “It will be a great satisfaction,” Elfride murmured, and thought of Stephen, and wished she could make a great fortune by writing romances, and marry him and live happily.
Meanwhile, instead of going on a honeymoon scamper by ourselves, we have come home to fetch you, and go all together to Bath for two or three weeks.” Elfride assented pleasantly, even gladly; but she saw that, by this marriage, her father and herself had ceased for ever to be the close relations they had been up to a few weeks ago.
He was still snugly housed in her heart.
Elfride had her sex’s love of sheer force in a man, however ill-directed; and at that critical juncture in London Stephen’s only chance of retaining the ascendancy over her that his face and not his parts had acquired for him, would have been by doing what, for one thing, he was too youthful to undertake—that was, dragging her by the wrist to the rails of some altar, and peremptorily marrying her.
One stream only of evening sunlight came into the room from a window quite in the corner, overlooking a court.
“Now Smith, my lad, you know me well enough by this time, or you ought to; and you know very well that if you choose to give me a detailed account of the phenomenon within you, I shall listen; if you don’t, I am the last man in the world to care to hear it.” “I’ll tell this much: I HAVE fallen in love, and I want to be MARRIED.” Knight looked ominous as this passed Stephen’s lips.
“Now, though I know her thoroughly as she exists in your heart, Stephen, I don’t know her in the flesh.
I plod along, and occasionally lift my eyes and skim the weltering surface of mankind lying between me and the horizon, as a crow might; no more.” Knight stopped as if he had fallen into a train of thought, and Stephen looked with affectionate awe at a master whose mind, he believed, could swallow up at one meal all that his own head contained.
How many of us can say of our most intimate alter ego, leaving alone friends of the outer circle, that he is the man we should have chosen, as embodying the net result after adding up all the points in human nature that we love, and principles we hold, and subtracting all that we hate?
The man is really somebody we got to know by mere physical juxtaposition long maintained, and was taken into our confidence, and even heart, as a makeshift.
And no woman of that kind, who has committed herself so into a man’s hands as she has into mine, could possibly marry another.” “How has she committed herself?” asked Knight cunously.
Knight had looked on his love so sceptically that it would not do to say all that he had intended to say by any means.
“You remember what you said to me once about women receiving a kiss.
One was bringing out the romance and looking for notices in the papers, which, though they had been significantly short so far, had served to divert her thoughts.
Mrs. Swancourt considerably enlarged Elfride’s ideas in an aristocratic direction, and she began to forgive her father for his politic marriage.
“The absorbing self-consciousness of her position that is shown by her countenance is most humiliating to a lover of one’s country.
It was his attraction as a man.
Second, a slight slovenliness of umbrella, occasioned by its owner’s habit of resting heavily upon it, and using it as a veritable walking-stick, instead of letting its point touch the ground in the most coquettish of kisses, as is the proper Row manner to do.
You know, I suppose, of my marriage?” And there sprang up a dialogue concerning family matters of birth, death, and marriage, which it is not necessary to detail.
Elfride had just before received an affectionate letter from Stephen Smith in Bombay, which had been forwarded to her from Endelstow.
Probably there cannot be instanced a briefer and surer rule-of-thumb test of a man’s temperament—sanguine or cautious—than this: did he or does he ante-date the word wife in corresponding with a sweet-heart he honestly loves?
It proves that you were clever enough to make him think of Sir Walter Scott, which is a great deal.” “Oh yes; though I cannot romance myself, I am able to remind him of those who can!” Elfride intended to hurl these words sarcastically at her invisible enemy, but as she had no more satirical power than a wood-pigeon, they merely fell in a pretty murmur from lips shaped to a pout.
Your book is good enough to be bad in an ordinary literary manner, and doesn’t stand by itself in a melancholy position altogether worse than assailable.—‘That interest in an historical romance may nowadays have any chance of being sustained, it is indispensable that the reader find himself under the guidance of some nearly extinct species of legendary, who, in addition to an impulse towards antiquarian research and an unweakened faith in the mediaeval halo, shall possess an inventive faculty in which delicacy of sentiment is far overtopped by a power of welding to stirring incident a spirited variety of the elementary human passions.’ Well, that long-winded effusion doesn’t refer to you at all, Elfride, merely something put in to fill up.
When Elfride fell asleep that night she was loving the writer of the letter, but thinking of the writer of that article.
A mere season in London with her practised step-mother had so advanced Elfride’s perceptions, that her courtship by Stephen seemed emotionally meagre, and to have drifted back several years into a childish past.
She was seated on a low chair, looking over her romance with melancholy interest for the first time since she had become acquainted with the remarks of the PRESENT thereupon.
Then the vicar paused and slightly yawned, and in the manner of elderly people began to cool from his ardour for the undertaking now that it came to the point.
“Oh,” said Elfride, her heart sinking within her.
Are you going to write another romance?” “Write another?” she said.
“And what when she has been married?” she said at last, partly in order to withdraw her own person from the argument.
“With all my heart,” said Knight.
Elfride’s heart beat so violently that she could not sit still.
“I wrote my poor romance in that way—I mean in bits, out of doors—and I should like to see whether your way of entering things is the same as mine.” “Really, that’s rather an awkward request.
Town-bred girl will utter some moral paradox on fast men, or love.
All mankind think thoughts as bad as those of people they most love on earth, but such thoughts never getting embodied on paper, it becomes assumed that they never existed.
True, Stephen had declared he loved her: Mr. Knight had never done anything of the sort.
Had the position been reversed—had Stephen loved her in spite of a differing taste, and had Knight been indifferent in spite of her resemblance to his ideal, it would have engendered far happier thoughts.
“People like him, who go about the great world, don’t care in the least what I am like either in mood or feature.” Perhaps a man who has got thoroughly into a woman’s mind in this manner, is half way to her heart; the distance between those two stations is proverbially short.
The longing for Knight’s respect, which was leading up to an incipient yearning for his love, made the present conjuncture a sufficient one.
Whilst kneeling down previous to leaving, when the sunny streaks had gone upward to the roof, and the lower part of the church was in soft shadow, she could not help thinking of Coleridge’s morbid poem “The Three Graves,” and shuddering as she wondered if Mrs. Jethway were cursing her, she wept as if her heart would break.
It is extraordinary how many women have no honest love of music as an end and not as a means, even leaving out those who have nothing in them.
I have never met a woman who loves music as do ten or a dozen men I know.” “How would you draw the line between women with something and women with nothing in them?” “Well,” said Knight, reflecting a moment, “I mean by nothing in them those who don’t care about anything solid.
This is an instance: I knew a man who had a young friend in whom he was much interested; in fact, they were going to be married.
Seeing that the loss occurred whilst Stephen Smith was attempting to kiss her for the first time on the cliff, her confusion was hardly to be wondered at.
And coming gallantly to her own rescue, “If I really seem vain, it is that I am only vain in my ways—not in my heart.
Anybody’s life may be just as romantic and strange and interesting if he or she fails as if he or she succeed.
It is whimsical of the world to hold that particulars of how a lad went to school and so on should be as an interesting romance or as nothing to them, precisely in proportion to his after renown.” They were walking between the sunset and the moonrise.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>And that idle one low down upon the ground, that we have almost rolled away from, is in India—over the head of a young friend of mine, who very possibly looks at the star in our zenith, as it hangs low upon his horizon, and thinks of it as marking where his true love dwells.” Elfride glanced at Knight with misgiving.
Fortunately or unfortunately for him he fell in love, and then went to Bombay.
One day of absence superimposed itself on another, and proportionately weighted his heart.
He pushed on to the Lakes of Killarney, rambled amid their luxuriant woods, surveyed the infinite variety of island, hill, and dale there to be found, listened to the marvellous echoes of that romantic spot; but altogether missed the glory and the dream he formerly found in such favoured regions.
The superfluity had become a necessity, and Knight was in love.
Stephen fell in love with Elfride by looking at her: Knight by ceasing to do so.
Had he begun to love her when she met his eye after her mishap on the tower?
Had he grown to love her whilst standing on the lawn brightened all over by the evening sun?
Knight’s experience was a complete disproof of the assumption that love always comes by glances of the eye and sympathetic touches of the fingers: that, like flame, it makes itself palpable at the moment of generation.
Thus, having passively gathered up images of her which his mind did not act upon till the cause of them was no longer before him, he appeared to himself to have fallen in love with her soul, which had temporarily assumed its disembodiment to accompany him on his way.
Yet it must be said that Knight loved philosophically rather than with romance.
Was she flirting?
It was very odd to himself to look at his theories on the subject of love, and reading them now by the full light of a new experience, to see how much more his sentences meant than he had felt them to mean when they were written.
Inbred in him was an invincible objection to be any but the first comer in a woman’s heart.
He had discovered within himself the condition that if ever he did make up his mind to marry, it must be on the certainty that no cropping out of inconvenient old letters, no bow and blush to a mysterious stranger casually met, should be a possible source of discomposure.
Knight’s sentiments were only the ordinary ones of a man of his age who loves genuinely, perhaps exaggerated a little by his pursuits.
When men first love as lads, it is with the very centre of their hearts, nothing else being concerned in the operation.
A man in love setting up his brains as a gauge of his position is as one determining a ship’s longitude from a light at the mast-head.
Knight argued from Elfride’s unwontedness of manner, which was matter of fact, to an unwontedness in love, which was matter of inference only.
“Elfride,” he said, “had hardly looked upon a man till she saw me.” He had never forgotten his severity to her because she preferred ornament to edification, and had since excused her a hundred times by thinking how natural to womankind was a love of adornment, and how necessary became a mild infusion of personal vanity to complete the delicate and fascinating dye of the feminine mind.
Notwithstanding that he had concocted a great deal of paper theory on social amenities and modern manners generally, the special ounce of practice was wanting, and now for his life Knight could not recollect whether it was considered correct to give a young lady personal ornaments before a regular engagement to marry had been initiated.
She beguiled herself by saying, “Perhaps if I had not so committed myself I might fall in love with Mr. Knight.” All this made the week of Knight’s absence very gloomy and distasteful to her.
Knight scented romantic occasions from afar, and foresaw that such a one might be expected before the coming night.
“Well, I’ll tell you my object in getting the present,” said Knight, with a composure intended to remove from her mind any possible impression of his being what he was—her lover.
And the tantalizing feature was that perhaps he suspected her to imagine them offered as a lover’s token, which was mortifying enough if they were not.
Could Knight have been told that it was a sense of fidelity struggling against new love, whilst no less assuring as to his ultimate victory, it might have entirely abstracted the wish to secure it.
He is not inconveniently deep in love, and is lulled by a peaceful sense of being able to enjoy the most trivial thing with a childlike enjoyment.
He will, I think, Elfride, feel now that my pretensions to your hand are anything but the dream of a silly boy not worth rational consideration.” With a natural delicacy, Elfride, in mentioning her father’s marriage, had refrained from all allusion to the pecuniary resources of the lady.
And a letter was written to Stephen, stating that as yet she hardly understood her position with regard to the money sent; but declaring that she was ready to fulfil her promise to marry him.
Fidelity to the old love and truth to the new were ranged on opposite sides, and truth virtuelessly prevailed.
Perhaps something may happen, and I may tell you something.” “Mere coyness,” said Knight to himself; and went away with a lighter heart.
She would meet him, and do all that lay in her power to marry him.
Elfride’s heart fell like lead.
The mental picture of Elfride in the world, without himself to cherish her, smote his heart like a whip.
Beneath his feet was aerial space and the unknown; above him was the firm, familiar ground, and upon it all that he loved best.
His eyes passed all description in their combination of the whole diapason of eloquence, from lover’s deep love to fellow-man’s gratitude for a token of remembrance from one of his kind.
Perhaps he was only grateful, and did not love her.
Regarding their attitude, it was impossible for two persons to go nearer to a kiss than went Knight and Elfride during those minutes of impulsive embrace in the pelting rain.
Yet they did not kiss.
He went inside the doorway, sat down upon the stone bench, and waited with a beating heart.
Stephen was conscious of a gnawing pain at his heart.
Whenever he was not in agony, the business in hand had driven out of his mind by sheer force all deep reflection on the subject of Elfride and love.
He felt inclined to linger awhile upon the quay before ascending the hills, having formed a romantic intention to go home by way of her house, yet not wishing to wander in its neighbourhood till the evening shades should sufficiently screen him from observation.
The twilight was now quite pronounced enough for his purpose; and as, rather sad at heart, he was about to move on, a little boat containing two persons glided up the middle of the harbour with the lightness of a shadow.
His heart swerved from its beat; he shunned receiving the meaning he sought.
“It is half-past eight,” she said in a low voice, which had a peculiar music in it, seemingly born of a thrill of pleasure at the new proof that she was beloved.
Stephen, shattered in spirit and sick to his heart’s centre, turned away.
Will you let her break your heart, and bring you to an untimely grave, as she did the one before you?” “You are Mrs. Jethway, I think.
And why do you talk so wildly?” “Because my heart is desolate, and nobody cares about it.
That his rival should be Knight, whom once upon a time he had adored as a man is very rarely adored by another in modern times, and whom he loved now, added deprecation to sorrow, and cynicism to both.
Henry Knight, whose praises he had so frequently trumpeted in her ears, of whom she had actually been jealous, lest she herself should be lessened in Stephen’s love on account of him, had probably won her the more easily by reason of those very praises which he had only ceased to utter by her command.
That she looked up at and adored her new lover from below his pedestal, was even more perceptible than that she had smiled down upon Stephen from a height above him.
To an unimpassioned outsider, it admitted of at least two interpretations—it might either have proceeded from an endeavour to be faithful to her first choice, till the lover seen absolutely overpowered the lover remembered, or from a wish not to lose his love till sure of the love of another.
He did not know many facts of the case, but could not help instinctively associating Elfride’s fickleness with the marriage of her father, and their introduction to London society.
Here he could see the old vicarage, the house alone that was associated with the sweet pleasant time of his incipient love for Elfride.
Among those persons who have romantic sentiments on the subject of their last dwelling-place, probably the greater number would have chosen such a spot as this in preference to any other: a few would have fancied a constraint in its trim neatness, and would have preferred the wild hill-top of the neighbouring site, with Nature in her most negligent attire.
Lady Luxellian stood aloof from ’em so—was so drowsy-like, that they couldn’t love her in the jolly-companion way children want to like folks.
She fell in love with this young man of hers, and their banns were asked in some church in London; and the old lord her father actually heard ’em asked the three times, and didn’t notice her name, being gabbled on wi’ a host of others.
When she had married she told her father, and ’a fleed into a monstrous rage, and said she shouldn’ hae a farthing.
Well, the poor thing died at her first gossiping, and her husband—who was as tender-hearted a man as ever eat meat, and would have died for her—went wild in his mind, and broke his heart (so ’twas said).
But as it is, the blood is run out, and she’s nothing to the Luxellian family by law, whatever she may be by gospel.” “I used to fancy,” said Simeon, “when I seed Miss Elfride hugging the little ladyships, that there was a likeness; but I suppose ’twas only my dream, for years must have altered the old family shape.” “And now we’ll move these two, and home-along,” interposed John Smith, reviving, as became a master, the spirit of labour, which had showed unmistakable signs of being nearly vanquished by the spirit of chat, “The flagon of ale we don’t want we’ll let bide here till to-morrow; none of the poor souls will touch it ’a b’lieve.” So the evening’s work was concluded, and the party drew from the abode of the quiet dead, closing the old iron door, and shooting the lock loudly into the huge copper staple—an incongruous act of imprisonment towards those who had no dreams of escape.
Partly, too, Stephen’s failure to make his hold on her heart a permanent one was his too timid habit of dispraising himself beside her—a peculiarity which, exercised towards sensible men, stirs a kindly chord of attachment that a marked assertiveness would leave untouched, but inevitably leads the most sensible woman in the world to undervalue him who practises it.
“I don’t love him less, but I love Mr. Knight more!” Yes: she would save herself from a man not fit for her—in spite of vows.
Such solitary walks and scenes as that witnessed by Smith in the summer-house were frequent, but he courted her so intangibly that to any but such a delicate perception as Elfride’s it would have appeared no courtship at all.
Knowing since the betrayal of his sentiments that love for her really existed, she preferred it for the present in its form of essence, and was willing to avoid for awhile the grosser medium of words.
On ordinary occasions she had a tongue so frank as to show her whole mind, and a mind so straightforward as to reveal her heart to its innermost shrine.
When women are secret they are secret indeed; and more often than not they only begin to be secret with the advent of a second lover.
The intense fear which accompanies intense love in young women was too strong to allow the exercise of a moral quality antagonistic to itself: “Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.” The match was looked upon as made by her father and mother.
However, the passage is, that a woman’s words to a lover are as a matter of course written only on wind and water.
When Elfride met him, it was with a much greater lightness of heart; things were more straightforward now.
Her heart, which at first had quailed in consternation, recovered itself when she considered the character of John Smith.
A quiet unassuming man, he would be sure to act towards her as before those love passages with his son, which might have given a more pretentious mechanic airs.
In short, sir, he’s down in the vault there, a-looking at the departed coffins.” Elfride’s heart fluttered like a butterfly.
His old sense of indebtedness to Knight had never wholly forsaken him; his love for Elfride was generous now.
And if this is to be our first and last meeting, let me say that I wish you success with all my heart!” Knight’s warmth revived towards the end; the solemn impressions he was beginning to receive from the scene around them abstracting from his heart as a puerility any momentary vexation at words.
I have heard my father say that they—he—ran away with her, and married her against the wish of her parents.” “Then I imagine this to be where you got your Christian name, Miss Swancourt?” said Knight, turning to her.
Her left hand rested lightly within Knight’s arm, half withdrawn, from a sense of shame at claiming him before her old lover, yet unwilling to renounce him; so that her glove merely touched his sleeve.
“‘Can one be pardoned, and retain the offence?’” quoted Elfride’s heart then.
The charm of woman, too, lies partly in her subtleness in matters of love.
I am staying at her father’s house, as you probably know.” He stepped a few paces nearer to Smith, and said in a lower tone: “I may as well tell you that we are engaged to be married.” Low as the words had been spoken, Elfride had heard them, and awaited Stephen’s reply in breathless silence, if that could be called silence where Elfride’s dress, at each throb of her heart, shook and indicated it like a pulse-glass, rustling also against the wall in reply to the same throbbing.
Stephen bade him adieu at the churchyard-gate without going outside, and watched whilst he and his sweetheart mounted their horses.
Her old lover still looked on at the performance as he leant over the gate a dozen yards off.
Once in the saddle, and having a firm grip of the reins, she turned her head as if by a resistless fascination, and for the first time since that memorable parting on the moor outside St. Launce’s after the passionate attempt at marriage with him, Elfride looked in the face of the young man she first had loved.
To Elfride the intense agony of reproach in Stephen’s eye was a nail piercing her heart with a deadliness no words can describe.
Even the recent sight of Stephen’s face and the sound of his voice, which for a moment had stirred a chord or two of ancient kindness, were unable to keep down the adoration re-existent now that he was again out of view.
“And what is it about?” gaily returned her lover.
Now that the crisis had come, no qualms of conscience, no love of honesty, no yearning to make a confidence and obtain forgiveness with a kiss, could string Elfride up to the venture.
The certainty of one more day’s affection, which she gained by silence, outvalued the hope of a perpetuity combined with the risk of all.
“Well,” he added, after a minute, “I like you all the better, you know, for such moral precision, although I called it absurd.” He went on with tender earnestness: “For, Elfride, there is one thing I do love to see in a woman—that is, a soul truthful and clear as heaven’s light.
I specially mean by honesty, fairness not only in matters of business and social detail, but in all the delicate dealings of love, to which the licence given to your sex particularly refers.” Elfride looked troublously at the trees.
He died because you were his own well-agreed sweetheart, and then proved false—and it killed him.
“I could not help his loving me, Mrs. Jethway!” “That’s just what you could have helped.
He was gentle and nice—I always thought him so—and I liked him.” “Then why did you let him kiss you?” “It is a falsehood; oh, it is, it is!” said Elfride, weeping with desperation.
“He came behind me, and attempted to kiss me; and that was why I told him never to let me see him again.” “But you did not tell your father or anybody, as you would have if you had looked upon it then as the insult you now pretend it was.” “He begged me not to tell, and foolishly enough I did not.
And before his body was cold, you took another to your heart.
Have you forgotten the would-be runaway marriage?

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The journey to London, and the return the next day without being married, and that there’s enough disgrace in that to ruin a woman’s good name far less light than yours?
Fickleness towards a lover is bad, but fickleness after playing the wife is wantonness.” “Oh, it’s a wicked cruel lie!
As much of the story as was known is creeping about the neighbourhood even now; but I know more than any of them, and why should I respect your love?” “I defy you!” cried Elfride tempestuously.
Look, there he comes.” And her voice trembled greatly as she saw through the leaves the beloved form of Knight coming from the door with her hat in his hand.
The excitement of her latter words had restored colour to Elfride’s cheeks; and hastily wiping her eyes, she walked farther on, so that by the time her lover had overtaken her the traces of emotion had nearly disappeared from her face.
I believe—am almost sure, in fact—that if statistics could be obtained on the subject, you would find the persons with thin hair were those who had a superabundance originally, and that those who start with a moderate quantity retain it without much loss.” Elfride’s troubles sat upon her face as well as in her heart.
“I’ll take out these ugly ones at once,” she exclaimed, “and I’ll wear yours—shall I?” “I should be gratified.” Now, though it may seem unlikely, considering how far the two had gone in converse, Knight had never yet ventured to kiss Elfride.
My thought was, would it be right to let you?” “Then I will!” he rejoined, with that singular earnestness about a small matter—in the eyes of a ladies’ man but a momentary peg for flirtation or jest—which is only found in deep natures who have been wholly unused to toying with womankind, and which, from its unwontedness, is in itself a tribute the most precious that can be rendered, and homage the most exquisite to be received.
Now turn round, dearest.” She was powerless to disobey, and turned forthwith; and then, without any defined intention in either’s mind, his face and hers drew closer together; and he supported her there, and kissed her.
And now, without having quite intended an early marriage, he put the question plainly.
It came with all the ardour which was the accumulation of long years behind a natural reserve.
“Elfride, when shall we be married?” The words were sweet to her; but there was a bitter in the sweet.
Loving him in secret had not seemed such thorough-going inconstancy as the same love recognized and acted upon in the face of threats.
“Take your time.” Knight was as honourable a man as was ever loved and deluded by woman.
It may be said that his blindness in love proved the point, for shrewdness in love usually goes with meanness in general.
Knight, as a lover, was more single-minded and far simpler than his friend Stephen, who in other capacities was shallow beside him.
Without saying more on the subject of their marriage, Knight held her at arm’s length, as if she had been a large bouquet, and looked at her with critical affection.
“Undoubtedly, perfectly!” said her lover, adopting a lighter tone to put her at her ease.
Exactly the colour of my sweetheart’s.” “Really?” said Elfride, enjoying as truth what she knew to be flattery.
Say yes, say yes!” “One recantation is enough for to-day.” “No, no.” “Very well, blue eyes.” And Knight laughed, and drew her close and kissed her the second time, which operations he performed with the carefulness of a fruiterer touching a bunch of grapes so as not to disturb their bloom.
Her lover was with her again, and it was enough: she made her heart over to him entirely.
She was never tired of asking her lover questions and admiring his answers, good, bad, or indifferent as they might be.
She ran up and slipped her hand through Knight’s arm, partly for love, partly for stability.
Her sudden wish had really been to discover at once whether he had ever before been engaged to be married.
“Oh no—not at all.” “And have you never kissed many ladies?” she whispered, hoping he would say a hundred at the least.
I have never given a woman a kiss in my life, except yourself and my mother.” The man of two and thirty with the experienced mind warmed all over with a boy’s ingenuous shame as he made the confession.
“But I always had thought that men made lots of engagements before they married—especially if they don’t marry very young.” “So all women think, I suppose—and rightly, indeed, of the majority of bachelors, as I said before.
“If you had ever been engaged to be married before,” he went on, “I expect your opinion of my addresses would be different.
But then, I should not——” “Should not what, Harry?” “Oh, I was merely going to say that in that case I should never have given myself the pleasure of proposing to you, since your freedom from that experience was your attraction, darling.” “You are severe on women, are you not?” “No, I think not.
To think that I should have discovered such an unseen flower down there in the West—to whom a man is as much as a multitude to some women, and a trip down the English Channel like a voyage round the world!” “And would you,” she said, and her voice was tremulous, “have given up a lady—if you had become engaged to her—and then found she had had ONE kiss before yours—and would you have—gone away and left her?” “One kiss,—no, hardly for that.” “Two?” “Well—I could hardly say inventorially like that.
Presently her mutterings became distinct: “Don’t tell him—he will not love me....I did not mean any disgrace—indeed I did not, so don’t tell Harry.
We were going to be married—that was why I ran away....And he says he will not have a kissed woman....And if you tell him he will go away, and I shall die.
The unreserved girl was never chary of letting her lover discover how much she admired him.
What romance attaches to the other?” “It was a gift to me.” The subject then dropped.
Admitting it to be a gift, he thought she could hardly value a mere friend more than she valued him as a lover, and giving the plant into his charge would have made no difference.
“Except, indeed, it was the gift of a lover,” he murmured.
“I wonder if Elfride has ever had a lover before?” he said aloud, as a new idea, quite.
The next day, when they were again alone, he said to her rather suddenly— “Do you love me more or less, Elfie, for what I told you on board the steamer?” “You told me so many things,” she returned, lifting her eyes to his and smiling.
“I mean the confession you coaxed out of me—that I had never been in the position of lover before.” “It is a satisfaction, I suppose, to be the first in your heart,” she said to him, with an attempt to continue her smiling.
“It is this: have you ever had a lover?
I am almost sure you have not; but, have you?” “Not, as it were, a lover; I mean, not worth mentioning, Harry,” she faltered.
Knight, overstrained in sentiment as he knew the feeling to be, felt some sickness of heart.
“Still, he was a lover?” “Well, a sort of lover, I suppose,” she responded tardily.
“A man, I mean, you know.” “Yes; but only a mere person, and——” “But truly your lover?” “Yes; a lover certainly—he was that.
For she might have had a lover, and never have cared in the least for him.
“Did you love that lover or admirer of yours ever so little, Elfie?” She murmured reluctantly, “Yes, I think I did.” Knight felt the same faint touch of misery.
“I am not sure how much.” “But you are sure, darling, you loved him a little?” “I think I am sure I loved him a little.” “And not a great deal, Elfie?” “My love was not supported by reverence for his powers.” “But, Elfride, did you love him deeply?” said Knight restlessly.
I did not love him as I do you.
Ordinary men are not so delicate in their tastes as you; and where the lover or husband is not fastidious, and refined, and of a deep nature, things seem to go on better, I fancy—as far as I have been able to observe the world.” “Yes; I suppose it is right.
Don’t!” “I’ll try not to, Elfride.” So she hoped, but her heart was troubled.
With a look of relief and regret combined, denoting that ease came to the heart and disappointment to the brain, Elfride paused for several minutes, as if undecided how to act.
It would ruin me with him, and break my heart.
“That experience teaches, and your sweetheart, no less than your tailor, is necessarily very imperfect in her duties, if you are her first patron: and conversely, the sweetheart who is graceful under the initial kiss must be supposed to have had some practice in the trade.” “And do you mean to say that you wrote that upon the strength of another man’s remark, without having tested it by practice?” “Yes—indeed I do.” “Then I think it was uncalled for and unfair.
Every literary Jack becomes a gentleman if he can only pen a few indifferent satires upon womankind: women themselves, too, have taken to the trick; and so, upon the whole, I begin to be rather ashamed of my companions.” “Ah, Henry, you have fallen in love since and it makes a difference,” said Mrs. Swancourt with a faint tone of banter.
Coming, rather singularly, just after his discovery that Elfride had known what it was to love warmly before she had known him, his mind dwelt upon the subject, and the familiar pipe he smoked, whilst pacing up and down the shrubbery-path, failed to be a solace.
He thought again of those idle words—hitherto quite forgotten—about the first kiss of a girl, and the theory seemed more than reasonable.
Elfride, under Knight’s kiss, had certainly been a very different woman from herself under Stephen’s.
It was during that “initial kiss” by the little waterfall: “We must be careful.
“I always meant to be the first comer in a woman’s heart, fresh lips or none for me.” How childishly blind he must have seemed to this mere girl!
He began to think it was as hard to be earliest in a woman’s heart as it was to be first in the Pool of Bethesda.
That Knight should have been thus constituted: that Elfride’s second lover should not have been one of the great mass of bustling mankind, little given to introspection, whose good-nature might have compensated for any lack of appreciativeness, was the chance of things.
That her throbbing, self-confounding, indiscreet heart should have to defend itself unaided against the keen scrutiny and logical power which Knight, now that his suspicions were awakened, would sooner or later be sure to exercise against her, was her misfortune.
A miserable incongruity was apparent in the circumstance of a strong mind practising its unerring archery upon a heart which the owner of that mind loved better than his own.
So, though thought of the former cliff had caused her to shudder at the perils to which her lover and herself had there been exposed, by being associated with Knight only it was not so objectionable as Windy Beak.
Elfride was burdened with the very intensity of her love.
Elfride wished it could be a longer time ago that she had sat there with Stephen as her lover, and agreed to be his wife.
“Well, that is a most extraordinary thing, that we should find it like this!” Knight then remembered more circumstances; “What, is it the one you have told me of?” “Yes.” The unfortunate remark of hers at the kiss came into his mind, if eyes were ever an index to be trusted.
“Were you really engaged to be married to that lover?” he said, looking straight forward at the sea again.
Yet I think I was.” “O Elfride, engaged to be married!” he murmured.
“Elfride, I told you once,” he said, following out his thoughts, “that I never kissed a woman as a sweetheart until I kissed you.
A kiss is not much, I suppose, and it happens to few young people to be able to avoid all blandishments and attentions except from the one they afterwards marry.
You naturally granted your former lover the privileges you grant me.” A “yes” came from her like the last sad whisper of a breeze.
“And he used to kiss you—of course he did.” “Yes.” “And perhaps you allowed him a more free manner in his love-making than I have shown in mine.” “No, I did not.” This was rather more alertly spoken.
“So many days and hours as I have hoped in you—I have feared to kiss you more than those two times.
“When that lover first kissed you, Elfride was it in such a place as this?” “Yes, it was.” “You don’t tell me anything but what I wring out of you.
“Where were you when he first kissed you?” “Sitting in this seat.” “Ah, I thought so!” said Knight, rising and facing her.
Forgive the harsh word, Elfride—forgive it.” He smiled a surface smile as he continued: “What a poor mortal I am to play second fiddle in everything and to be deluded by fibs!” “Oh, don’t say it; don’t, Harry!” “Where did he kiss you besides here?” “Sitting on—a tomb in the—churchyard—and other places,” she answered with slow recklessness.
Such entire confidence as he had pictured as about to exist between himself and the innocent young wife who had known no lover’s tones save his—was this its beginning?
Knight, still alive on the subject of Elfride’s secret, thought of her words concerning the kiss that it once had occurred on a tomb in this churchyard.
“Elfride,” he said, with a superficial archness which did not half cover an undercurrent of reproach, “do you know, I think you might have told me voluntarily about that past—of kisses and betrothing—without giving me so much uneasiness and trouble.
Elfride did not even now go on with the explanation her exacting lover wished to have, and her reticence began to irritate him as before.
was he who lies buried there the man who was your lover?” Knight asked in a distinct voice.
“Yes; and I didn’t love him or encourage him.” “But you let him kiss you—you said so, you know, Elfride.” She made no reply.
“Why,” said Knight, recollecting circumstances by degrees, “you surely said you were in some degree engaged to him—and of course you were if he kissed you.
Forgive me, Harry, won’t you?” “What, a lover in the tomb and a lover on it?” “Oh—Oh—yes!” “Then there were two before me?
I don’t know what I might have done—no man can say into what shape circumstances may warp him—but I hardly think I should have had the conscience to accept the favours of a new lover whilst sitting over the poor remains of the old one; upon my soul, I don’t.” Knight, in moody meditation, continued looking towards the tomb, which stood staring them in the face like an avenging ghost.
“And him in the grave I never once loved.” “I suppose the second lover and you, as you sat there, vowed to be faithful to each other for ever?” Elfride only replied by quick heavy breaths, showing she was on the brink of a sob.
The feeling I have about it would be called, and is, mere sentimentality; and I don’t want you to suppose that an ordinary previous engagement of a straightforward kind would make any practical difference in my love, or my wish to make you my wife.
It is this: that if there WERE much more to add to an account which already includes all the particulars that a broken marriage engagement could possibly include with propriety, it must be some exceptional thing which might make it impossible for me or any one else to love you and marry you.” Knight’s disturbed mood led him much further than he would have gone in a quieter moment.
And, even as it was, had she been assertive to any degree he would not have been so peremptory; and had she been a stronger character—more practical and less imaginative—she would have made more use of her position in his heart to influence him.
You never said you had had nobody else here making love to you, so why should I blame you?
All I cared for was that, wherever you came from, whatever you had done, whoever you had loved, you were mine at last.
Harry, if originally you had known I had loved, would you never have cared for me?” “I won’t quite say that.
But I think this: that if I had known there was any phase of your past love you would refuse to reveal if I asked to know it, I should never have loved you.” Elfride sobbed bitterly.
You loved him, remember.” —“And loved him a little!” “And refuse now to answer the simple question how it ended.
Trust me as I trust you.” “That’s not at all.” “I shall not love you if you are so cruel.
Heaven knows that I didn’t mean to; but I have loved you so that I have used you badly.” “I don’t mind it, Harry!” she instantly answered, creeping up and nestling against him; “and I will not think at all that you used me harshly if you will forgive me, and not be vexed with me any more?
He supported her lightly over the stile, and was practically as attentive as a lover could be.
Perhaps Knight was not shaped by Nature for a marrying man.
She was a farmer’s wife, very well educated—a governess originally, I believe.” Knight’s heart was moved to sympathy.
It could quickly be put an end to by hastening on his marriage with her.
To make a start in this new direction by marriage, which, since knowing Elfride, had been so entrancing an idea, was less exquisite to-night.
Though Knight’s heart had so greatly mastered him, the mastery was not so complete as to be easily maintained in the face of a moderate intellectual revival.
“SIR,—A woman who has not much in the world to lose by any censure this act may bring upon her, wishes to give you some hints concerning a lady you love.
“One who encouraged an honest youth to love her, then slighted him, so that he died.
“One who next took a man of no birth as a lover, who was forbidden the house by her father.
“One who secretly left her home to be married to that man, met him, and went with him to London.
It would ruin me with him, and break my heart.
She may have been moaning from the bottom of her heart, “How unhappy am I!” But the impression produced on Knight was not a good one.
Ah, I wish you were your own dear self again, and had kissed me when I came up!
Don’t talk of kissing, for God’s sake!
I should think you might with advantage have shown tact enough to keep back that word ‘kiss,’ considering those you have accepted.” She became very pale, and a rigid and desolate charactery took possession of her face.
“Are you not going to love me?” she burst out.
“Harry, Harry, love me, and speak as usual!
I know this: a religion was building itself upon you in my heart.
If I have hidden anything from you, it has been because I loved you so, and I feared—feared—to lose you.” “Since you are not given to confidence, I want to ask you some plain questions.
My sole wish was not to endanger our love.
Elfride, DID you run away with a man you loved?—that was the damnable statement.
“To be married to him?” came huskily from his lips.
I had never seen you, Harry.” “To London?” “Yes; but I——” “Answer my questions; say nothing else, Elfride Did you ever deliberately try to marry him in secret?” “No; not deliberately.” “But did you do it?” A feeble red passed over her face.
But I dared not; I loved you too well.
“We shall not marry, Elfride.” How much anguish passed into her soul at those words from him was told by the look of supreme torture she wore.
If you cannot marry him now, and another makes you his wife, do not reveal this secret to him after marriage, if you do not before.
Forgive your Elfride for coming—I love you so!” Knight’s agitation and astonishment mastered him for a few moments.
And I have been all day travelling to you, and you won’t make me go away again, will you, Harry, because I shall always love you till I die?” “Yet it is wrong for you to stay.
Say you love me just the same, and don’t let me be separated from you again, will you?
Swancourt, don’t be harsh with her—let me beg of you to be tender with her, and love her!” “To you, sir,” said Mr. Swancourt, turning to him as if by the sheer pressure of circumstances, “I have little to say.
Why you could not conduct your courtship of my daughter like an honest man, I do not know.
I came.” “If you wished the marriage broken off, why didn’t you say so plainly?
If you never intended to marry, why could you not leave her alone?
Upon my soul, it grates me to the heart to be obliged to think so ill of a man I thought my friend!” Knight, soul-sick and weary of his life, did not arouse himself to utter a word in reply.
It was a faint ray of pleasure straying into the great gloominess of his brain to think that the vicar might never know but that he, as her lover, tempted her away, which seemed to be the form Mr. Swancourt’s misapprehension had taken.
Elfride loved him, he knew, and he could not leave off loving her but marry her he would not.
And how could he marry this Elfride, one who, if he had originally seen her as she was, would have been barely an interesting pitiable acquaintance in his eyes—no more?
It cankered his heart to think he was confronted by the closest instance of a worse state of things than any he had assumed in the pleasant social philosophy and satire of his essays.
The spirit of self-denial, verging on asceticism, which had ever animated Knight in old times, announced itself as having departed with the birth of love, with it having gone the self-respect which had compensated for the lack of self-gratification.
With a consciousness of having thus, like Antony, kissed away kingdoms and provinces, he next considered how he had revealed his higher secrets and intentions to her, an unreserve he would never have allowed himself with any man living.
Knight’s was a robust intellect, which could escape outside the atmosphere of heart, and perceive that his own love, as well as other people’s, could be reduced by change of scene and circumstances.
What’s the meaning of such sudden love for a’ old woman?” “Can’t say; unless ’tis repentance.” “Repentance!
Time thus rolls us on to a February afternoon, divided by fifteen months from the parting of Elfride and her lover in the brown stubble field towards the sea.
Stephen certainly was full of the feelings begotten by the belief that Knight had taken away the woman he loved so well.
“Are you married?” “I am not.” Knight spoke in an indescribable tone of bitterness that was almost moroseness.
“Engagements to marry often end like that—for better or for worse.” “Yes; so they do.
“Do you know,” Stephen continued, “I could almost have sworn that you would be married before this time, from what I saw?” Knight’s face grew harder.
“Yes; and I simply wonder at it.” “Whom did you expect me to marry?” “Her I saw you with.” “Thank you for that wonder.” “Did she jilt you?” “Smith, now one word to you,” Knight returned steadily.
But let it go, let it go, by all means.” “What would you explain?” “I lost the woman I was going to marry: you have not married as you intended.
As good a reason as you had for not marrying her.” “You talk insidiously.
“Did she not love you enough?” He drew his breath in a slow and attenuated stream, as he waited in timorous hope for the answer.
Perhaps this staunchness was because Knight ever treated him as a mere disciple—even to snubbing him sometimes; and had at last, though unwittingly, inflicted upon him the greatest snub of all, that of taking away his sweetheart.
The familiar sights and sounds of London, the meeting with his friend, had with him also revived that sense of abiding continuity with regard to Elfride and love which his absence at the other side of the world had to some extent suspended, though never ruptured.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I feel it deeply; and I tell you plainly, I shall never forget it!” “What?” “Your behaviour at that meeting in the family vault, when I told you we were going to be married.
“Nor could you with due regard to her have married her, I suppose!
You took her away from me, did you not?” “Picking up what another throws down can scarcely be called ‘taking away.’ However, we shall not agree too well upon that subject, so we had better part.” “But I am quite certain you misapprehend something most grievously,” said Stephen, shaken to the bottom of his heart.
To fancy otherwise accorded better with the hope to which Knight’s estrangement had given birth: that love for his friend was not the direct cause, but a result of her suspension of love for himself.
He told the details of its origin, and the peremptory words and actions of her father to extinguish their love.
Their love seemed so innocent and childlike thus far.
He told how he waited in the fields whilst this then reproachful sweetheart went for her pony, and how the last kiss he ever gave her was given a mile out of the town, on the way to Endelstow.
So this supposition that his companion had ceased to love Elfride was an enormous lightening of the weight which had turned the scale against him.
“Admitting that Elfride COULD love another man after you,” said the elder, under the same varnish of careless criticism, “she was none the worse for that experience.” “The worse?
Poor child, she always persisted in thinking so, and was frightened more than enough.” “Stephen, do you love her now?” “Well, I like her; I always shall, you know,” he said evasively, and with all the strategy love suggested.
“But I have not seen her for so long that I can hardly be expected to love her.
Do you love her still?” “How shall I answer without being ashamed?
Men may love strongest for a while, but women love longest.
I used to love her—in my way, you know.” “Yes, I understand.
Ah, and I used to love her in my way.
In fact, I loved her a good deal at one time; but travel has a tendency to obliterate early fancies.” “It has—it has, truly.” Perhaps the most extraordinary feature in this conversation was the circumstance that, though each interlocutor had at first his suspicions of the other’s abiding passion awakened by several little acts, neither would allow himself to see that his friend might now be speaking deceitfully as well as he.
It smote his heart like a switch when he remembered how gently she had borne his scourging speeches, never answering him with a single reproach, only assuring him of her unbounded love.
Their rupture must have occurred soon after Stephen’s discovery of the fact of their union; and, Stephen went on to think, what so probable as that a return of her errant affection to himself was the cause?
Stephen’s opinions in this matter were those of a lover, and not the balanced judgment of an unbiassed spectator.
Chapter XXXIX “Each to the loved one’s side.” The friends and rivals breakfasted together the next morning.
“Yes.” The selfishness of love and the cruelty of jealousy were fairly exemplified at this moment.
Elfride Swancourt may have loved you once, no doubt, but it was when she was so young that she hardly knew her own mind.” “Thank you,” said Stephen laconically.
And it seemed a hard thing to find you had got her, and that if it had not been for you, all might have turned out well for me.” Stephen spoke with a swelling heart, and looked out of the window to hide the emotion that would make itself visible upon his face.
When you had won her, I did not interfere; and you might, I think, Mr. Knight, do by me as I did by you!” “Don’t ‘Mr.’ me; you are as well in the world as I am now.” “First love is deepest; and that was mine.” “Who told you that?” said Knight superciliously.
“I had her first love.
Just because, when I was a lad, I was accustomed to look up to you as a master, and you helped me a little, for which I was grateful to you and have loved you, you assume too much now, and step in before me.
“Has she broken her heart?” said Henry Knight.
And may God have NO mercy upon me!” “How can you have killed her more than I?” “Why, I went away from her—stole away almost—and didn’t tell her I should not come again; and at that last meeting I did not kiss her once, but let her miserably go.
“I don’t know.” A long silence ensued....“Elfride married!” said Stephen then in a thin whisper, as if he feared to let the assertion loose on the world.
She is beyond our love, and let her be beyond our reproach.
Since we don’t know half the reasons that made her do as she did, Stephen, how can we say, even now, that she was not pure and true in heart?” Knight’s voice had now become mild and gentle as a child’s.
Perhaps you know that since I saw you last I have married Martin Cannister.” “How long have you been married?” “About five months.
We were married the same day that my dear Miss Elfie became Lady Luxellian.” Tears appeared in Unity’s eyes, and filled them, and fell down her cheek, in spite of efforts to the contrary.
When she was better, I said she would live to be married yet, and she said then, ‘Yes; I’ll do anything for the benefit of my family, so as to turn my useless life to some practical account.’ Well, it began like this about Lord Luxellian courting her.
However, the time went on, and one day I said, ‘Miss Elfride, you don’t look so well as you used to; and though nobody else seems to notice it I do.’ She laughed a little, and said, ‘I shall live to be married yet, as you told me.’ “‘Shall you, miss?
“‘Whom do you think I am going to be married to?’ she said again.
‘Whom do you think I am going to be married to?’ “‘I don’t know,’ I said this time.
“‘But he don’t come courting much,’ I said.
About a month before the wedding, she and my lord and the two children used to ride about together upon horseback, and a very pretty sight they were; and if you’ll believe me, I never saw him once with her unless the children were with her too—which made the courting so strange-looking.
When she was ready, I ran upstairs and slipped on my own wedding gown, and away they went, and away went Martin and I; and no sooner had my lord and my lady been married than the parson married us.
Well, hope will hold its own in a young heart, if so be it can; and my lady freshened up a bit, for my lord was SO handsome and kind.” “How came she to die—and away from home?” murmured Knight.
“Don’t you see, sir, she fell off again afore they’d been married long, and my lord took her abroad for change of scene.

Though time be fleet, and I and thou Are half a life asunder, Thy loving smile will surely hail The love-gift of a fairy-tale.
“Oh, you wicked little thing!” cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace.
Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside.
I wonder if the snow _loves_ the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently?
The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little Lily in silence.
“There ought to be some men moving about somewhere—and so there are!” She added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on.
“I can’t remember here.” So they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into another open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air, and shook itself free from Alice’s arms.
“The first thing in a visit is to say ‘How d’ye do?’ and shake hands!” And here the two brothers gave each other a hug, and then they held out the two hands that were free, to shake hands with her.
“‘_The Walrus and the Carpenter_’ is the longest,” Tweedledum replied, giving his brother an affectionate hug.
My heart went hop, my heart went thump; I filled the kettle at the pump.
His name is Haigha.” (He pronounced it so as to rhyme with “mayor.”) “I love my love with an H,” Alice couldn’t help beginning, “because he is Happy.
“This young lady loves you with an H,” the King said, introducing Alice in the hope of turning off the Messenger’s attention from himself—but it was no use—the Anglo-Saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side.
It saves time, remember!” And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, “just in honour of having been a Red Queen.” “Snowdrop, my pet!” she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, “when _will_ Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder?

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“Well, look here,” he continued, with the remains of a calculation in his tone, which calculation had been the reduction to figures of the probable monetary magnetism necessary to overpower the resistant force of her present purse and the woman’s love of comeliness, “here’s a sovereign—a gold sovereign, almost new.” He held it out between his finger and thumb.
She wants my hair to get another lover with; though if stories are true she’s broke the heart of many a noble gentleman already.” “Lord, it’s wonderful how you guess things, Marty,” said the barber.
“Marty South,” he said, with deliberate emphasis, “_you’ve got a lover yourself_, and that’s why you won’t let it go!” She reddened so intensely as to pass the mild blush that suffices to heighten beauty; she put the yellow leather glove on one hand, took up the hook with the other, and sat down doggedly to her work without turning her face to him again.
To this Mrs. Melbury replied that Grace would be sure to marry well, and that hence a hundred pounds more or less from him would not make much difference.
“I have a plan in my head about her,” he said; “and according to my plan she won’t marry a rich man.” “A plan for her not to marry well?” said his wife, surprised.
“It is a plan for her to marry a particular person, and as he has not so much money as she might expect, it might be called as you call it.
I want her to marry Giles Winterborne.” His companion repeated the name.
“He adores the very ground she walks on; only he’s close, and won’t show it much.” Marty South appeared startled, and could not tear herself away.
I vowed to let her marry him, and to make her as valuable as I could to him by schooling her as many years and as thoroughly as possible.
I shall not stay long.” He was silent a while; then he told her, as nearly as Marty could gather, that his first wife, his daughter Grace’s mother, was first the sweetheart of Winterborne’s father, who loved her tenderly, till he, the speaker, won her away from him by a trick, because he wanted to marry her himself.
He sadly went on to say that the other man’s happiness was ruined by it; that though he married Winterborne’s mother, it was but a half-hearted business with him.
Melbury added that he was afterwards very miserable at what he had done; but that as time went on, and the children grew up, and seemed to be attached to each other, he determined to do all he could to right the wrong by letting his daughter marry the lad; not only that, but to give her the best education he could afford, so as to make the gift as valuable a one as it lay in his power to bestow.
“He is in love with her, and he’s honest and upright.
Yes, let me get ’em married up as soon as I can, so as to have it over and done with.” He continued looking at the imprint, while he added, “Suppose she should be dying, and never make a track on this path any more?” “She’ll write soon, depend upon’t.
She would not turn again to the little looking-glass, out of humanity to herself, knowing what a deflowered visage would look back at her, and almost break her heart; she dreaded it as much as did her own ancestral goddess Sif the reflection in the pool after the rape of her locks by Loke the malicious.
“Come in!” The door was flung back, and there stepped in upon the mat a man not particularly young for a lover, nor particularly mature for a person of affairs.
Lord, it has shrunk to nothing—it looks an apple upon a gate-post!” Her heart swelled, and she could not speak.
In addition to the sentimental relationship which arose from his father having been the first Mrs. Melbury’s lover, Winterborne’s aunt had married and emigrated with the brother of the timber-merchant many years before—an alliance that was sufficient to place Winterborne, though the poorer, on a footing of social intimacy with the Melburys.
“Ah, Grammer Oliver,” said John Upjohn, “it do do my heart good to see a old woman like you so dapper and stirring, when I bear in mind that after fifty one year counts as two did afore!
But here he comes.” Just before this moment Winterborne had seen Melbury crossing the court from his door.
After that melancholy event little Grace had clung to the nurse with much affection; and ultimately Melbury, in dread lest the only woman who cared for the girl should be induced to leave her, persuaded the mild Lucy to marry him.
Inside the carriage a pair of bright eyes looked from a ripely handsome face, and though behind those bright eyes was a mind of unfathomed mysteries, beneath them there beat a heart capable of quick extempore warmth—a heart which could, indeed, be passionately and imprudently warm on certain occasions.
Her face was lit with the natural elation of a young girl hoping to inaugurate on the morrow an intimate acquaintance with a new, interesting, and powerful friend.
Winterborne’s fingers were endowed with a gentle conjuror’s touch in spreading the roots of each little tree, resulting in a sort of caress, under which the delicate fibres all laid themselves out in their proper directions for growth.
And I love dear old Hintock, _and the people in it_, fifty times better than all the Continent.
“If ye’d ha’ married, d’ye see, maister,” he said, “this caddle couldn’t have happened to us.” Everything being at last under way, the oven set, and all done that could insure the supper turning up ready at some time or other, Giles and his friends entered the parlor, where the Melburys again dropped into position as guests, though the room was not nearly so warm and cheerful as the blazing bakehouse.
’Twas good enough to make any king’s heart merry—ay, to make his whole carcass smile.
But here was the fact, which could not be disguised: since seeing what an immense change her last twelve months of absence had produced in his daughter, after the heavy sum per annum that he had been spending for several years upon her education, he was reluctant to let her marry Giles Winterborne, indefinitely occupied as woodsman, cider-merchant, apple-farmer, and what not, even were she willing to marry him herself.
Whatever pleases you will please me.” “I am promised to him, father; and I cannot help thinking that in honor I ought to marry him, whenever I do marry.” He had a strong suspicion that somewhere in the bottom of her heart there pulsed an old simple indigenous feeling favorable to Giles, though it had become overlaid with implanted tastes.
“He ought not to have spoken to ye like that!” said the old man, in the tone of one whose heart was bruised, though it was not by the epithet applied to himself.
“Grace,” he said, just before they had reached the house, “if it costs me my life you shall marry well!
You shall marry well.” He breathed heavily, and his breathing was caught up by the breeze, which seemed to sigh a soft remonstrance.
To sow in her heart cravings for social position was obviously his strong desire, though in direct antagonism to a better feeling which had hitherto prevailed with him, and had, indeed, only succumbed that morning during the ramble.
“I have nothing to say in objection—I cannot say anything till I’ve thought a while.” She added, with emotion in her tone, “For myself, I would have married you—some day—I think.
Grace heaved a divided sigh, with a tense pause between, and moved onward, her heart feeling uncomfortably big and heavy, and her eyes wet.
Oh, going to Italy—yes to be sure, I heard she was going abroad, she can’t endure the winter here.” Winterborne was vexed at the incident; the more so that he knew Mr. Melbury, in his adoration of Hintock House, would be the first to blame him if it became known.
I’ll do all I can for him as a friend; but as a pretender to the position of my son-in law, that can never be thought of more.” And yet at that very moment the impracticability to which poor Winterborne’s suit had been reduced was touching Grace’s heart to a warmer sentiment on his behalf than she had felt for years concerning him.
His heart sank within him when he perceived that despite all the legal reciprocities and safeguards prepared and written, the upshot of the matter amounted to this, that it depended upon the mere caprice—good or ill—of the woman he had met the day before in such an unfortunate way, whether he was to possess his houses for life or no.
Had Winterborne been going on in the old fashion, Grace’s father could have alluded to his disapproval of the alliance every day with the greatest frankness; but to speak any further on the subject he could not find it in his heart to do now.
He declared that he did not like to be hard on a man when he was in difficulty; but he really did not see how Winterborne could marry his daughter now, without even a house to take her to.
What suddenly filled his heart far more than curiosity about their authorship was a terrible belief that they were turning out to be true, try to see Grace as he might.
There could not be the least doubt that gentle Grace was warming to more sympathy with, and interest in, Giles Winterborne than ever she had done while he was her promised lover; that since his misfortune those social shortcomings of his, which contrasted so awkwardly with her later experiences of life, had become obscured by the generous revival of an old romantic attachment to him.
She was a different sort of girl altogether.” As Giles was nobody, Fitzpiers treated him accordingly, and apostrophized the night in continuation: “She moved upon this earth a shape of brightness, A power, that from its objects scarcely drew One impulse of her being—in her lightness Most like some radiant cloud of morning dew, Which wanders through the waste air’s pathless blue, To nourish some far desert: she did seem Beside me, gathering beauty as she grew, Like the bright shade of some immortal dream Which walks, when tempests sleep, the wave of life’s dark stream.” The consummate charm of the lines seemed to Winterborne, though he divined that they were a quotation, to be somehow the result of his lost love’s charms upon Fitzpiers.
“You seem to be mightily in love with her, sir,” he said, with a sensation of heart-sickness, and more than ever resolved not to mention Grace by name.
Human love is a subjective thing—the essence itself of man, as that great thinker Spinoza the philosopher says—_ipsa hominis essentia_—it is joy accompanied by an idea which we project against any suitable object in the line of our vision, just as the rainbow iris is projected against an oak, ash, or elm tree indifferently.
Such miserable creatures of circumstance are we all!” “Well, it is what we call being in love down in these parts, whether or no,” said Winterborne.
“You are right enough if you admit that I am in love with something in my own head, and no thing in itself outside it at all.” “Is it part of a country doctor’s duties to learn that view of things, may I ask, sir?” said Winterborne, adopting the Socratic εἰρωνεία with such well-assumed simplicity that Fitzpiers answered, readily, “Oh no.
I hope to do better things than marry and settle in Hintock.
Not but that it is well for a medical man to be married, and sometimes, begad, ’twould be pleasant enough in this place, with the wind roaring round the house, and the rain and the boughs beating against it.
He must know all about those invisible ones of the days gone by, whose feet have traversed the fields which look so gray from his windows; recall whose creaking plough has turned those sods from time to time; whose hands planted the trees that form a crest to the opposite hill; whose horses and hounds have torn through that underwood; what birds affect that particular brake; what domestic dramas of love, jealousy, revenge, or disappointment have been enacted in the cottages, the mansion, the street, or on the green.
One thing was clear—any acquaintance with her could only, with a due regard to his future, be casual, at most of the nature of a flirtation; for he had high aims, and they would some day lead him into other spheres than this.
“It really makes my heart ache to let you stay here.” Immediately inside the front door was the door of his sitting-room; he flung it open, and stood in a coaxing attitude.
Socially we can never be intimate.
And, indeed, I have other aims on the practical side of my life.” Fitzpiers bestowed a regulation thought on the advantageous marriage he was bound to make with a woman of family as good as his own, and of purse much longer.
His first notion—acquired from the mere sight of her without converse—that of an idle and vulgar flirtation with a timber-merchant’s pretty daughter, grated painfully upon him now that he had found what Grace intrinsically was.
The thought that he might settle here and become welded in with this sylvan life by marrying Grace Melbury crossed his mind for a moment.
“Bless my heart, who would have thought of finding you here,” he said, obviously much pleased at the circumstance.
His sense of personal superiority wasted away, and Grace assumed in his eyes the true aspect of a mistress in her lover’s regard.
“That’s the end of what is called love!” said some one.
He was now irretrievably committed in heart to Grace Melbury, though he was by no means sure that she was so far committed to him.
But though she’s a lady in herself, and worthy of any such as he, it do seem to me that he ought to marry somebody more of the sort of Mrs. Charmond, and that Miss Grace should make the best of Winterborne.” Marty returned no comment; and at that minute the girls, some of whom were from Great Hintock, were seen advancing to work the incantation, it being now about midnight.
Seeing Fitzpiers standing there, she said, with playful effrontery, “May’st kiss me if ‘canst catch me, Tim!” Fitzpiers recognized her as Suke Damson, a hoydenish damsel of the hamlet, who was plainly mistaking him for her lover.
On she went under the boughs, now in light, now in shade, looking over her shoulder at him every few moments and kissing her hand; but so cunningly dodging about among the trees and moon-shades that she never allowed him to get dangerously near her.
As soon as he paused, tantalized and puzzled, he was directed anew by an imitative kiss which came from her hiding-place, and by snatches of a local ballad in the smallest voice she could assume: “O come in from the foggy, foggy dew.” In a minute or two he uncovered her.
Fitzpiers, however, disregarded her resistance by reason of its mildness, stooped and imprinted the purposed kiss, then sunk down on the next hay-cock, panting with his race.
He suspected that this man, who seemed so distressed and melancholy, might be that lover and persistent wooer of Mrs. Charmond whom he had heard so frequently spoken of, and whom it was said she had treated cavalierly.
“I mean, get acquainted with her, with a view to being her accepted lover; and if we suited each other, what would naturally follow.” The timber-merchant was much surprised, and fairly agitated; his hand trembled as he laid by his walking-stick.
The doctor saw this, and honestly dreading to lose sight of her, he said, eagerly, “Between ourselves, if I am successful with her I will take her away myself for a month or two, as soon as we are married, which I hope will be before the chilly weather comes on.
Looking on the ground, and planting his stick at each tread as if it were a flag-staff, he reached his own precincts, where, as he passed through the court, he automatically stopped to look at the men working in the shed and around.
Melbury stood; then turning suddenly away without answering, he went up the court and entered the house.
Why, you’ve flung your grapnel over the doctor, and he’s coming courting forthwith.” “Only think of that, my dear!
“Coming courting!
I needn’t tell you to make it all smooth for him.” “You mean, to lead him on to marry me?” “I do.
His daughter’s suitor was descended from a family he had heard of in his grandfather’s time as being once great, a family which had conferred its name upon a neighboring village; how, then, could anything be amiss in this betrothal?
It was a degradation of even such a rude form of art as this to be treatad so grossly, she thought, and for the first time the family of Fitzpiers assumed in her imagination the hues of a melancholy romanticism.
In an excitement which was not love, not ambition, rather a fearful consciousness of hazard in the air, she awaited his return.
Over and above the genuine emotion which she raised in his heart there hung the sense that he was casting a die by impulse which he might not have thrown by judgment.
When the young pair were in the great brick-floored hall the lover took the girl’s hand in his, drew it under his arm, and thus led her on to the door, where he stealthily kissed her.
Fitzpiers drove off, kissing his hand to her, and waving it to Melbury who was visible through the window.
It was this rather than any vulgar idea of marrying well which caused her to float with the current, and to yield to the immense influence which Fitzpiers exercised over her whenever she shared his society.
Any observer would shrewdly have prophesied that whether or not she loved him as yet in the ordinary sense, she was pretty sure to do so in time.
My inclination is not to be married at the horrid little church here, with all the yokels staring round at us, and a droning parson reading.” “Where, then, can it be?
“How can I be married except at church, and with all my dear friends round me?” “Yeoman Winterborne among them.” “Yes—why not?
You know there was nothing serious between him and me.” “You see, dear, a noisy bell-ringing marriage at church has this objection in our case: it would be a thing of report a long way round.
The disappointment she had experienced at his wish, the shock given to her girlish sensibilities by his irreverent views of marriage, together with the sure and near approach of the day fixed for committing her future to his keeping, made her so restless that she could scarcely sleep at all that night.
I wish not to marry Mr. Fitzpiers.
I wish not to marry anybody; but I’ll marry Giles Winterborne if you say I must as an alternative.” Her father’s face settled into rigidity, he turned pale, and came deliberately out of the plot before he answered her.
I won’t say to ye, you _shall_ marry him.
I spoke to him so closely about the question of marriage with you that he did not apprehend my state of mind.” “But there’s something wrong—eh?” he asked, eying her narrowly, and bending to kiss her.
She shrank away, and his purposed kiss miscarried.
Knowing nothing of the incident in the wood on old Midsummer-eve, Grace felt that her suspicions were unworthy and absurd, and with the readiness of an honest heart she jumped at the opportunity of honoring his word.
In the remote and fashionable town of Sandbourne something was growing up under the hands of several persons who had never seen Grace Melbury, never would see her, or care anything about her at all, though their creation had such interesting relation to her life that it would enclose her very heart at a moment when that heart would beat, if not with more emotional ardor, at least with more emotional turbulence than at any previous time.
But what an attenuation was this cold pride of the dream of her youth, in which she had pictured herself walking in state towards the altar, flushed by the purple light and bloom of her own passion, without a single misgiving as to the sealing of the bond, and fervently receiving as her due “The homage of a thousand hearts; the fond, deep love of one.” Everything had been clear then, in imagination; now something was undefined.
Down in the heart of the apple country nearly every farmer kept up a cider-making apparatus and wring-house for his own use, building up the pomace in great straw “cheeses,” as they were called; but here, on the margin of Pomona’s plain, was a debatable land neither orchard nor sylvan exclusively, where the apple produce was hardly sufficient to warrant each proprietor in keeping a mill of his own.
Or she might have thought of days earlier yet—days of childhood—when her mouth was somewhat more ready to receive a kiss from his than was his to bestow one.
“No—I could never have married him!” she said, gently shaking her head.
Seeing that Giles still kept his back turned, and with a little of the above-described pride of life—easily to be understood, and possibly excused, in a young, inexperienced woman who thought she had married well—she said at last, with a smile on her lips, “Mr.
I could hardly sit here so near you without a word of recognition.” Winterborne’s heart had swollen big, and his eyes grown moist by this time, so much had the gentle answer of that familiar voice moved him.
He could have declared with a contemporary poet— “If I forget, The salt creek may forget the ocean; If I forget The heart whence flows my heart’s bright motion, May I sink meanlier than the worst Abandoned, outcast, crushed, accurst, If I forget.
But I have seen somebody out there that we know,” she replied, looking into the court.
It is true I was just saying to myself that I never could have married him; but I have much regard for him, and always shall.” “Well, do by all means, my dear one.
In their travels together she had ranged so unerringly at his level in ideas, tastes, and habits that he had almost forgotten how his heart had played havoc with his principles in taking her to him.
Melbury and his wife welcomed the twain with affection, and all the house with deference.
She was a little soured at losing by his marriage so profitable a tenant as the surgeon had proved to be during his residence under her roof; and the more so in there being hardly the remotest chance of her getting such another settler in the Hintock solitudes.
“Never mind me, Mrs. Cox; go ahead.” “It is what people say about your hasty marrying, Dr. Fitzpiers.
Whereas they won’t believe you know such clever doctrines in physic as they once supposed of ye, seeing as you could marry into Mr. Melbury’s family, which is only Hintock-born, such as me.” “They are kindly welcome to their opinion,” said Fitzpiers, not allowing himself to recognize that he winced.
I can’t stand it, and that’s the truth.” She had been sadly surprised at the suddenness of his distaste for those old-fashioned woodland forms of life which in his courtship he had professed to regard with so much interest.
But now, having proved a traitor to his own cause by this marriage, Fitzpiers was believed in no more as a superior hedged by his own divinity; while as doctor he began to be rated no higher than old Jones, whom they had so long despised.
It was the first time since their marriage that he had left her without a kiss.
I picked them up, and then—” “Well?” “I kissed them,” he rejoined, rather shamefacedly.
I was young then, and I kissed them.
“My mother, knowing my disposition, said she had no wish for such a chit as me to go falling in love with an impecunious student, and spirited me away to Baden.
Oh, the heart of a man!

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>To find her here, however, in these somewhat romantic circumstances, magnified that by-gone and transitory tenderness to indescribable proportions.
What would have immediately followed I know not; but sorrow and sickness of heart at last.” “Why?” “Well—that’s the end of all love, according to Nature’s law.
“Since we are only picturing the possibilities of that time, don’t, for pity’s sake, spoil the picture.” Her voice sank almost to a whisper as she added, with an incipient pout upon her full lips, “Let me think at least that if you had really loved me at all seriously, you would have loved me for ever and ever!” “You are right—think it with all your heart,” said he.
But don’t ever ask me to do it, and particularly do not press me to tell you now.” Thus the two or three days that they had spent in tender acquaintance on the romantic slopes above the Neckar were stretched out in retrospect to the length and importance of years; made to form a canvas for infinite fancies, idle dreams, luxurious melancholies, and sweet, alluring assertions which could neither be proved nor disproved.
She liked mystery, in her life, in her love, in her history.
I fear I am not a good business-man.” He spoke the last words with a momentary faltering at the great foolishness of his act; for, as he looked in her fair and honorable face, his heart reproached him for what he had done.
But her husband had seemed so dissatisfied with the circumstances hereabout since their marriage that she had sincerely hoped to go for his sake.
I love this place too well to depart.” “You _have?_” she said, regarding him with wild uncertainty.
In the evening, with listless adroitness, she encouraged the maid who dressed her for dinner to speak of Dr. Fitzpiers’s marriage.
“And why didn’t she marry him?” said Mrs. Charmond.
“In refusing that poor man his reasonable request,” she said to herself, “I foredoomed my rejuvenated girlhood’s romance.
Who would have thought such a business matter could have nettled my own heart like this?
But her hope that he was again immersing himself in those lucubrations which before her marriage had made his light a landmark in Hintock, was founded simply on the slender fact that he often sat up late.
It told tales of the nature of her affection for him.
In truth, her antenuptial regard for Fitzpiers had been rather of the quality of awe towards a superior being than of tender solicitude for a lover.
Fitzpiers bade her adieu with affection, even with tenderness, and she observed that he looked weary-eyed.
Notwithstanding this untoward proceeding she was determined to be loyal if he proved true; and the determination to love one’s best will carry a heart a long way towards making that best an ever-growing thing.
In all this proud show some kernels were unsound as her own situation, and she wondered if there were one world in the universe where the fruit had no worm, and marriage no sorrow.
Thus she had beheld the pet animal purchased for her own use, in pure love of her, by one who had always been true, impressed to convey her husband away from her to the side of a new-found idol.
Her heart rose from its late sadness like a released spring; her senses revelled in the sudden lapse back to nature unadorned.
Here Grace stopped; some few yards up the transverse ride the buxom Suke Damson was visible—her gown tucked up high through her pocket-hole, and no bonnet on her head—in the act of pulling down boughs from which she was gathering and eating nuts with great rapidity, her lover Tim Tangs standing near her engaged in the same pleasant meal.
But though possessed by none of that feline wildness which it was her moral duty to experience, she did not fail to know that she had made a frightful mistake in her marriage.
If his protestations to her before their marriage could be believed, her husband had felt affection of some sort for herself and this woman simultaneously; and was now again spreading the same emotion over Mrs. Charmond and herself conjointly, his manner being still kind and fond at times.
But surely, rather than that, he must have played the hypocrite towards her in each case with elaborate completeness; and the thought of this sickened her, for it involved the conjecture that if he had not loved her, his only motive for making her his wife must have been her little fortune.
Yet here Grace made a mistake, for the love of men like Fitzpiers is unquestionably of such quality as to bear division and transference.
Therein it differed from the highest affection as the lower orders of the animal world differ from advanced organisms, partition causing, not death, but a multiplied existence.
He had loved her sincerely, and had by no means ceased to love her now.
“If he does not love me I will not love him!” said Grace, proudly.
And though these were mere words, it was a somewhat formidable thing for Fitzpiers that her heart was approximating to a state in which it might be possible to carry them out.
She could hardly suppose him, whatever his infatuation, to have prolonged to a later hour than ten an ostensibly professional call on Mrs. Charmond at Middleton; and he could have ridden home in two hours and a half.
His was the selfish passion of Congreve’s Millamont, to whom love’s supreme delight lay in “that heart which others bleed for, bleed for me.” When the horse had been attended to Melbury stood uneasily here and there about his premises; he was rudely disturbed in the comfortable views which had lately possessed him on his domestic concerns.
In the pure and simple life he had led it had scarcely occurred to him that after marriage a man might be faithless.
“I had long planned that she should marry the son of the man I wanted to make amends to; do ye mind how I told you all about it, Lucy, the night before she came home?
This was a worse feature in the flirtation than he had expected.
One day in February, about six months after the marriage of Fitzpiers, Melbury was returning from Great Hintock on foot through the lane, when he saw before him the surgeon also walking.
Why do I never recognize an opportunity till I have missed it, nor the good or ill of a step till it is irrevocable!...I fell in love....Love, indeed!— “‘Love’s but the frailty of the mind When ’tis not with ambition joined; A sickly flame which if not fed, expires, And feeding, wastes in self-consuming fires!’ Ah, old author of ‘The Way of the World,’ you knew—you knew!” Grace moved.
She had looked into her heart, and found that her early interest in Giles Winterborne had become revitalized into luxuriant growth by her widening perceptions of what was great and little in life.
Having discovered by marriage how much that was humanly not great could co-exist with attainments of an exceptional order, there was a revulsion in her sentiments from all that she had formerly clung to in this kind: honesty, goodness, manliness, tenderness, devotion, for her only existed in their purity now in the breasts of unvarnished men; and here was one who had manifested them towards her from his youth up.
“Waiting for your dear husband?” he inquired, speaking with the sarcasm of pitiful affection.
He glanced at her, and there returned upon his mind the scene of her offering to wed Winterborne instead of Fitzpiers in the last days before her marriage; and he asked himself if it could be the fact that she loved Winterborne, now that she had lost him, more than she had ever done when she was comparatively free to choose him.
Mrs. Charmond is thoughtlessly bad, not bad by calculation; and just a word to her now might save ’ee a peck of woes.” “Ah, I loved her once,” said Grace, with a broken articulation, “and she would not care for me then!
Now I no longer love her.
He had admitted to himself bitterly enough that he should have let young hearts have their way, or rather should have helped on her affection for Winterborne, and given her to him according to his original plan; but he was not prepared for her deprecation of those attainments whose completion had been a labor of years, and a severe tax upon his purse.
“I’ll tell you why for the first time.” He thereupon told Winterborne, as with great relief, the story of how he won away Giles’s father’s chosen one—by nothing worse than a lover’s cajoleries, it is true, but by means which, except in love, would certainly have been pronounced cruel and unfair.
Giles, she loved you—under the rind; and, what’s more, she loves ye still—worse luck for the poor maid!” If Melbury only had known what fires he was recklessly stirring up he might have held his peace.
“One who has smiled where she has not loved and loved where she has not married.
He married her and retired, and came down here and bought this property, as they do nowadays.” “Yes, yes—I know all about that; but the other I did not know.
Mrs. Charmond had been no friend to Winterborne, but he was manly, and it was not in his heart to let her be condemned without a trial.
“Never mind,” said Melbury, retreating into the court, “I’ll stand about here.” Charged so fully with his mission, he shrank from contact with anybody.
But he walked about the paved court till he was tired, and still nobody came to him.
They had heard of his arrival, but had not seen him enter, and, imagining him still in the court, discussed freely the possible reason of his calling.
Her mother was a very dear wife to me, but she was taken away from us when the child was young, and the child became precious as the apple of my eye to me, for she was all I had left to love.
For her sake entirely I married as second wife a homespun woman who had been kind as a mother to her.
In due time the question of her education came on, and I said, ‘I will educate the maid well, if I live upon bread to do it.’ Of her possible marriage I could not bear to think, for it seemed like a death that she should cleave to another man, and grow to think his house her home rather than mine.
Another man came and paid court to her—one her equal in breeding and accomplishments; in every way it seemed to me that he only could give her the home which her training had made a necessity almost.
I urged her on, and she married him.
I found that this well-born gentleman I had calculated on so surely was not stanch of heart, and that therein lay a danger of great sorrow for my daughter.
Madam, he saw you, and you know the rest....I have come to make no demands—to utter no threats; I have come simply as a father in great grief about this only child, and I beseech you to deal kindly with my daughter, and to do nothing which can turn her husband’s heart away from her forever.
She loved you once, ma’am; you began by liking her.
Then you dropped her without a reason, and it hurt her warm heart more than I can tell ye.
It was curious, but the allusion to Grace’s former love for her seemed to touch her more than all Melbury’s other arguments.
She had not seen her old lover for a long time, and, too conscious of the late pranks of her heart, she could not behold him calmly.
“And the man she is talking to?” “That’s Mr. Winterborne.” A redness stole into Marty’s face as she mentioned Giles’s name, which Mrs. Charmond did not fail to notice informed her of the state of the girl’s heart.
Fitzpiers, your husband—” The moment that the speaker’s tongue touched the dangerous subject a vivid look of self-consciousness flashed over her, in which her heart revealed, as by a lightning gleam, what filled it to overflowing.
“Then you _do_ love him!” she exclaimed, in a tone of much surprise.
“What do you mean, my young friend?” “Why,” cried Grace, “I thought till now that you had only been cruelly flirting with my husband, to amuse your idle moments—a rich lady with a poor professional gentleman whom in her heart she despised not much less than her who belongs to him.
But I guess from your manner that you love him desperately, and I don’t hate you as I did before.” “Yes, indeed,” continued Mrs. Fitzpiers, with a trembling tongue, “since it is not playing in your case at all, but _real_.
“I do not love him,” she went on, with desperate untruth.
During these last four or six months you have been terribly indiscreet; but you have not been insincere, and that almost disarms me.” “I _have_ been insincere—if you will have the word—I mean I _have_ coquetted, and do _not_ love him!” But Grace clung to her position like a limpet.
“You may have trifled with others, but him you love as you never loved another man.” “Oh, well—I won’t argue,” said Mrs. Charmond, laughing faintly.
“You may go on loving him if you like—I don’t mind at all.
I shall at once refuse to see him more—since it will make no difference to my heart, and much to my name.” “I question if you will refuse to see him again,” said Grace, dryly, as with eyes askance she bent a sapling down.
“Before I came I had been despising you for wanton cruelty; now I only pity you for misplaced affection.
I have to make a confession—I must make it!” she whispered, brokenly, the instinct to indulge in warmth of sentiment which had led this woman of passions to respond to Fitzpiers in the first place leading her now to find luxurious comfort in opening her heart to his wife.
Because you love him, you mean.” Felice Charmond denoted assent by a movement.
I shall eat away my heart if I do not let out all, after meeting you like this and finding how guileless you are.” She thereupon whispered a few words in the girl’s ear, and burst into a violent fit of sobbing.
“You may keep him—for me.” Had she been wounded instead of mortified she could not have used the words; but Fitzpiers’s hold upon her heart was slight.
It was poor Marty’s only card, and she played it, knowing nothing of fashion, and thinking her revelation a fatal one for a lover.
He became conscious of a discussion in progress on the opposite side of the court.
“Well, the day after to-morrow is the Sabbath day, and without charity we are but tinkling simples; but this I do say, that her going will be a blessed thing for a certain married couple who remain.” The fire was lighted, and Fitzpiers sat down in front of it, restless as the last leaf upon a tree.
The great court or quadrangle of the timber-merchant’s house, divided from the shady lane by an ivy-covered wall, was entered by two white gates, one standing near each extremity of the wall.
Because I see matchless attraction where matchless attraction is, both in person and position.
If I were a free man now, things have come to such a pass that she could not refuse me; while with her fortune (which I don’t covet for itself) I should have a chance of satisfying an honorable ambition—a chance I have never had yet, and now never, never shall have, probably!” Melbury, his heart throbbing against the other’s backbone, and his brain on fire with indignation, ventured to mutter huskily, “Why?” The horse ambled on some steps before Fitzpiers replied, “Because I am tied and bound to another by law, as tightly as I am to you by your arm—not that I complain of your arm—I thank you for helping me.
In their gestures and faces there were anxieties, affection, agony of heart, all for a man who had wronged them—had never really behaved towards either of them anyhow but selfishly.
While these three poor women stood together thus, pitying another though most to be pitied themselves, the pacing of a horse or horses became audible in the court, and in a moment Melbury’s voice was heard calling to his stableman.
He is my husband; and now you have married me to him surely you need not provoke him unnecessarily.
There was, in truth, a love-bird yearning to fly from her heart; and it wanted a lodging badly.
She had been betrayed by affrighted love into a visit which, now that the emotion instigating it had calmed down under her belief that Fitzpiers was in no danger, was the saddest surprise to her.
Somehow, in declaring to Grace and to herself the unseemliness of her infatuation, she had grown a convert to its irresistibility.
By degrees, as she sat, Felice’s mind—helped perhaps by the anticlimax of learning that her lover was unharmed after all her fright about him—grew wondrously strong in wise resolve.
What she saw outside might have struck terror into a heart stouter than a helpless woman’s at midnight.
A new court was established last year, and under the new statute, twenty and twenty-one Vic., cap.
eighty-five, unmarrying is as easy as marrying.
“And you’d better write also to the gentleman,” suggested Beaucock, who, scenting notoriety and the germ of a large practice in the case, wished to commit Melbury to it irretrievably; to effect which he knew that nothing would be so potent as awakening the passion of Grace for Winterborne, so that her father might not have the heart to withdraw from his attempt to make her love legitimate when he discovered that there were difficulties in the way.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>At these warm words Winterborne was not less dazed than he was moved in heart.
Surely the adamantine barrier of marriage with another could not be pierced like this!
Giles knew nothing of legal procedure, but he did know that for him to step up to Grace as a lover before the bond which bound her was actually dissolved was simply an extravagant dream of her father’s overstrained mind.
Winterborne was far too magnanimous to harbor any cynical conjecture that the timber-merchant, in his intense affection for Grace, was courting him now because that young lady, when disunited, would be left in an anomalous position, to escape which a bad husband was better than none.
There is no such thing as a stationary love: men are either loving more or loving less.
He had been laboring ever since his rejection and her marriage to reduce his former passion to a docile friendship, out of pure regard to its expediency; and their separation may have helped him to a partial success.
She saw nothing of Winterborne during the days of her recovery; and perhaps on that account her fancy wove about him a more romantic tissue than it could have done if he had stood before her with all the specks and flaws inseparable from corporeity.
In her secret heart she almost approximated to her father’s enthusiasm in wishing to show Giles once for all how she still regarded him.
Her heart rose in her throat.
Grace directed the man to set her down there in the midst, and immediately went up to her lover.
She was a woman who had been married; she had moved on; and without having lost her girlish modesty, she had lost her girlish shyness.
The dialogue had been affectionate comedy up to this point.
I am almost sure,” she added, uncertainly, “that I ought not to let you hold my hand yet, knowing that the documents—or whatever it may be—have not been signed; so that I—am still as married as ever—or almost.
If one of us were to die before the formal signing and sealing that is to release you have been done—if we should drop out of the world and never have made the most of this little, short, but real opportunity, I should think to myself as I sunk down dying, ‘Would to my God that I had spoken out my whole heart—given her one poor little kiss when I had the chance to give it!
And, because I have thought it, I by no means meant, in speaking of the proprieties, to be reserved and cold to you who loved me so long ago, or to hurt your heart as I used to do at that thoughtless time.
How could she explain in the street of a market-town that it was her superficial and transitory taste which had been offended, and not her nature or her affection?
I have set my heart upon seeing him your husband, if you ever have another.
Her father on returning and seeing the trifling coolness of Giles would be sure to say that the same perversity which had led her to make difficulties about marrying Fitzpiers was now prompting her to blow hot and cold with poor Winterborne.
Her father coming in the evening—which meant, she supposed, that all formalities would be in train, her marriage virtually annulled, and she be free to be won again—how could she look him in the face if he should see them estranged thus?
Winterborne quite forgot his superficial differences with the poor girl under the warm rush of deep and distracting love for her which the almost tragical information engendered.
If it is because I—did not like to let you kiss me in the Abbey—well, you know, Giles, that it was not on account of my cold feelings, but because I did certainly, just then, think it was rather premature, in spite of my poor father.
“And perhaps—as I am on the verge of freedom—I am not right, after all, in thinking there is any harm in your kissing me.” “Oh God!” said Winterborne within himself.
Since it was so—since it had come to this, that Grace, deeming herself free to do it, was virtually asking him to demonstrate that he loved her—since he could demonstrate it only too truly—since life was short and love was strong—he gave way to the temptation, notwithstanding that he perfectly well knew her to be wedded irrevocably to Fitzpiers.
Indeed, he cared for nothing past or future, simply accepting the present and what it brought, desiring once in his life to clasp in his arms her he had watched over and loved so long.
She started back suddenly from his embrace, influenced by a sort of inspiration.
How could he have dreamed of kissing her?
Even in the hour of Melbury’s greatest assurance Winterborne had harbored a suspicion that no law, new or old, could undo Grace’s marriage without her appearance in public; though he was not sufficiently sure of what might have been enacted to destroy by his own words her pleasing idea that a mere dash of the pen, on her father’s testimony, was going to be sufficient.
Poor Grace, perhaps feeling that she had indulged in too much fluster for a mere kiss, calmed herself at finding how grave he was.
“Giles, if you had only shown half the boldness before I married that you show now, you would have carried me off for your own first instead of second.
If we do marry, I hope you will never think badly of me for encouraging you a little, but my father is _so_ impatient, you know, as his years and infirmities increase, that he will wish to see us a little advanced when he comes.
I am not sure but that people may have to appear in a public court even under the new Act; and if there should be any difficulty, and we cannot marry after all—” Her cheeks became slowly bloodless.
I do love Giles; I cannot help that; and I have gone further with him than I should have done if I had known exactly how things were.
Thus she mentally blamed her ignorance; and yet in the centre of her heart she blessed it a little for what it had momentarily brought her.
“I don’t like this state that you are in—neither married nor single.
Three months ago you were my lover; now you are only my friend.
If ever Winterborne’s heart fretted his bosom it was at this sight of a perfectly defenceless creature conditioned by such circumstances.
That this crisis could end in nothing but sorrow was a view for a moment effaced by this triumphant thought of her trust in him; and the purity of the affection with which he responded to that trust rendered him more than proof against any frailty that besieged him in relation to her.
I do not at all mean that the question between us has not been settled by the fact of your marriage turning out hopelessly unalterable.
Cruel propriety is killing the dearest heart that ever woman clasped to her own.” While speaking thus to herself she had lit the lantern, and hastening out without further thought, took the direction whence the mutterings had proceeded.
Unable to withstand her impulse, she knelt down beside him, kissed his hands and his face and his hair, exclaiming, in a low voice, “How could I?
The perception of it added something that was little short of reverence to the deep affection for him of a woman who, herself, had more of Artemis than of Aphrodite in her constitution.
Grace rose from her attitude of affection, and, bracing her energies, saw that something practical must immediately be done.
She entered by the lower gate, and crossed the quadrangle to the wing wherein the apartments that had been hers since her marriage were situate, till she stood under a window which, if her husband were in the house, gave light to his bedchamber.
She faltered, and paused with her hand on her heart, in spite of herself.
She bathed him, kissed him, forgot all things but the fact that lying there before her was he who had loved her more than the mere lover would have loved; had martyred himself for her comfort, cared more for her self-respect than she had thought of caring.
“Have you been kissing him during his illness?” asked her husband.
He was not an outwardly religious man, but he was pure and perfect in his heart.
Shall we read a psalm over him?” “Oh yes—we will—with all my heart!” Grace opened the thin brown book, which poor Giles had kept at hand mainly for the convenience of whetting his pen-knife upon its leather covers.
She was shot—by a disappointed lover.
For, pertinent and pointed as Melbury’s story was, she had no heart for it now.
The scene between Fitzpiers and Felice had been sharp, as only a scene can be which arises out of the mortification of one woman by another in the presence of a lover.
“Marty,” she said, “we both loved him.
As no anticipation of gratified affection had been in existence while he was with them, there was none to be disappointed now that he had gone.
They knew by a glance at a trunk if its heart were sound, or tainted with incipient decay, and by the state of its upper twigs, the stratum that had been reached by its roots.
“He ought to have married _you_, Marty, and nobody else in the world!” said Grace, with conviction, after thinking somewhat in the above strain.
“In all our out-door days and years together, ma’am,” she replied, “the one thing he never spoke of to me was love; nor I to him.” “Yet you and he could speak in a tongue that nobody else knew—not even my father, though he came nearest knowing—the tongue of the trees and fruits and flowers themselves.” She could indulge in mournful fancies like this to Marty; but the hard core to her grief—which Marty’s had not—remained.
A little time might melt her frozen thoughts, and lead her to look on him with toleration, if not with love.
You may be absolutely indifferent to what I say, but let me say it: I have never loved any woman alive or dead as I love, respect, and honor you at this present moment.
What you told me in the pride and haughtiness of your heart I never believed [this, by the way, was not strictly true]; but even if I had believed it, it could never have estranged me from you.
You may call my fancies whimsical; but remember, sweet, lost one, that ‘nature is one in love, and where ’tis fine it sends some instance of itself.’ I will not intrude upon you further now.
Believe me, in spite of all you may do or feel, Your lover always (once your husband), “E.F.” It was, oddly enough, the first occasion, or nearly the first on which Grace had ever received a love-letter from him, his courtship having taken place under conditions which rendered letter-writing unnecessary.
Fitzpiers could hardly help showing his satisfaction at what her narrative indirectly revealed, the actual harmlessness of an escapade with her lover, which had at first, by her own showing, looked so grave, and he did not care to inquire whether that harmlessness had been the result of aim or of accident.
“It was nearly the whole.” They stood and looked over a gate at twenty or thirty starlings feeding in the grass, and he started the talk again by saying, in a low voice, “And yet I love you more than ever I loved you in my life.” Grace did not move her eyes from the birds, and folded her delicate lips as if to keep them in subjection.
“It is a different kind of love altogether,” said he.
“Well, then, why not give me a very little bit of your heart again?” The crash of a felled tree in the remote depths of the wood recalled the past at that moment, and all the homely faithfulness of Winterborne.
My heart is in the grave with Giles,” she replied, stanchly.
But if there can be no hope of our getting completely reconciled, treat me gently—wretch though I am.” “I did not say you were a wretch, nor have I ever said so.” “But you have such a contemptuous way of looking at me that I fear you think so.” Grace’s heart struggled between the wish not to be harsh and the fear that she might mislead him.
“But unless you can really love me again, Grace, I would rather go away from you forever.
If I had not cared more for your affection and forgiveness than my own personal comfort, I should never have come back here.
It amazed Fitzpiers, and overthrew all his deductions from previous experience, to find that this girl, though she had been married to him, could yet be so coy.
She became quite a student, reading more than she had done since her marriage But her seclusion was always broken for the periodical visit to Winterborne’s grave with Marty, which was kept up with pious strictness, for the purpose of putting snow-drops, primroses, and other vernal flowers thereon as they came.
To be frank with you—quite frank—I think of him as my betrothed lover still.
“You say your betrothed lover still,” he rejoined.
“It was when I was under the impression that my marriage with you was about to be annulled, and that he could then marry me.
So I encouraged him to love me.” Fitzpiers winced visibly; and yet, upon the whole, she was right in telling it.
Indeed, his perception that she was right in her absolute sincerity kept up his affectionate admiration for her under the pain of the rebuff.
I suppose it is of no use, but I ask, cannot you hope to—find a little love in your heart for me again?” “If I could I would oblige you; but I fear I cannot!” she replied, with illogical ruefulness.
“And I don’t see why you should mind my having had one lover besides yourself in my life, when you have had so many.” “But I can tell you honestly that I love you better than all of them put together, and that’s what you will not tell me!” “I am sorry; but I fear I cannot,” she said, sighing again.
“Now have pity, and tell me: will you try?” “To love you again?” “Yes; if you can.” “I don’t know how to reply,” she answered, her embarrassment proving her truth.
“Then I think that you might get your heart out of that grave,” said he, with playful sadness.
It was, naturally, quite out of his power to divine the singular, sentimental revival in Fitzpiers’s heart; the fineness of tissue which could take a deep, emotional—almost also an artistic—pleasure in being the yearning _innamorato_ of a woman he once had deserted, would have seemed an absurdity to the young sawyer.
Mr. and Mrs. Fitzpiers were separated; therefore the question of affection as between them was settled.
His marriage had so far been a total failure, a source of bitter regret; and the only course for improving his case, that of leaving the country, was a sorry, and possibly might not be a very effectual one.
She had married him; there was no getting over that; and ought she any longer to keep him at a distance?
He clasped his arms completely round, pressed her to his breast, and kissed her passionately.
“Grace, my wife, my love, how is this—what has happened?” “I was coming on to you,” she said as distinctly as she could in the half-smothered state of her face against his.

Why, when I went courting my wife that is now, the skilfulness that she would show in keeping me on her pretty side as she walked was beyond all belief.

No; I don’t think the women have got cleverer, for they was never otherwise.” “How many climates may there be in courtship, Mr. Upjohn?” inquired a youth—the same who had assisted at Winterborne’s Christmas party.

the_bride_of_lammermoor

He married Margaret, daughter to Ross of Balneel, with whom he obtained a considerable estate.
Shortly after, a suitor who was favoured by Lord Stair, and still more so by his lady, paid his addresses to Miss Dalrymple.
Lady Stair, a woman accustomed to universal submission, for even her husband did not dare to contradict her, treated this objection as a trifle, and insisted upon her daughter yielding her consent to marry the new suitor, David Dunbar, son and heir to David Dunbar of Baldoon, in Wigtonshire.
The first lover, a man of very high spirit, then interfered by letter, and insisted on the right he had acquired by his troth plighted with the young lady.
The lover, in return, declined positively to receive such an answer from any one but his mistress in person; and as she had to deal with a man who was both of a most determined character and of too high condition to be trifled with, Lady Stair was obliged to consent to an interview between Lord Rutherford and her daughter.
But she took care to be present in person, and argued the point with the disappointed and incensed lover with pertinacity equal to his own.
While the mother insisted on these topics, the lover in vain conjured the daughter to declare her own opinion and feelings.
Only at her mother’s command, sternly uttered, she summoned strength enough to restore to her plighted suitor the piece of broken gold which was the emblem of her troth.
The marriage betwixt Janet Dalrymple and David Dunbar of Baldoon now went forward, the bride showing no repugnance, but being absolutely passive in everything her mother commanded or advised.
On the day of the marriage, which, as was then usual, was celebrated by a great assemblage of friends and relations, she was the same—sad, silent, and resigned, as it seemed, to her destiny.
The only words she spoke were, “Tak up your bonny bridegroom.” She survived this horrible scene little more than a fortnight, having been married on the 24th of August, and dying on the 12th of September 1669.
The credulous Mr. Law says, generally, that the Lord President Stair had a daughter, who, “being married, the night she was bride in, was taken from her bridegroom and harled through the house (by spirits, we are given to understand) and afterward died.
The marriage, according to this account, had been against her mother’s inclination, who had given her consent in these ominous words: “Weel, you may marry him, but sair shall you repent it.” I find still another account darkly insinuated in some highly scurrilous and abusive verses, of which I have an original copy.
He seems, though his verses are as obscure as unpoetical, to intimate that the violence done to the bridegroom was by the intervention of the foul fiend, to whom the young lady had resigned herself, in case she should break her contract with her first lover.
“She had betrothed herself to Lord Rutherfoord under horrid imprecations, and afterwards married Baldoon, his nevoy, and her mother was the cause of her breach of faith.” The same tragedy is alluded to in the following couplet and note: What train of curses that base brood pursues, When the young nephew weds old uncle’s spouse.
The note on the word “uncle” explains it as meaning “Rutherfoord, who should have married the Lady Baldoon, was Baldoon’s uncle.” The poetry of this satire on Lord Stair and his family was, as already noticed, written by Sir William Hamilton of Whitelaw, a rival of Lord Stair for the situation of President of the Court of Session; a person much inferior to that great lawyer in talents, and equally ill-treated by the calumny or just satire of his contemporaries as an unjust and partial judge.
He furnished the family of Baldoon, with which he appears to have been intimate, with an elegy on the tragic event in their family.
A virtuous lady, not long since a bride, Was to a hopeful plant by marriage tied, And brought home hither.
Th’ affairs of court were unto him well known; And yet meanwhile he slighted not his own.
He knew full well how to behave at court, And yet but seldom did thereto resort; But lov’d the country life, choos’d to inure Himself to past’rage and agriculture; Proving, improving, ditching, trenching, draining, Viewing, reviewing, and by those means gaining; Planting, transplanting, levelling, erecting Walls, chambers, houses, terraces; projecting Now this, now that device, this draught, that measure, That might advance his profit with his pleasure.
The imaginary castle of Wolf’s Crag has been identified by some lover of locality with that of Fast Castle.
We have only to add, that the death of the unfortunate bridegroom by a fall from horseback has been in the novel transferred to the no less unfortunate lover.
I confess that, were it safe to cherish such dreams at all, I should more enjoy the thought of remaining behind the curtain unseen, like the ingenious manager of Punch and his wife Joan, and enjoying the astonishment and conjectures of my audience.
That early and more simple age considered alike the necessities of all ranks, and depicted the symbols of good cheer so as to be obvious to all capacities; well judging that a man who could not read a syllable might nevertheless love a pot of good ale as well as his better-educated neighbours, or even as the parson himself.
“Description,” he said, “was to the author of a romance exactly what drawing and tinting were to a painter: words were his colours, and, if properly employed, they could not fail to place the scene which he wished to conjure up as effectually before the mind’s eye as the tablet or canvas presents it to the bodily organ.
Only generally, from the languishing look of the young lady, and the care you have taken to present a very handsome leg on the part of the gentleman, I presume there is some reference to a love affair between them.” “Do you really presume to form such a bold conjecture?” said Tinto.
It was frequently beseiged with ardour, and defended with obstinacy, and, of course, its owners played a conspicuous part in story.
to assume the richer and more powerful crown of England, there had existed in Scotland contending parties, formed among the aristocracy, by whom, as their intrigues at the court of St. James’s chanced to prevail, the delegated powers of sovereignty were alternately swayed.
Even Abou Hassan, the most disinterested of all viceroys, forgot not, during his caliphate of one day, to send a douceur of one thousand pieces of gold to his own household; and the Scottish vicegerents, raised to power by the strength of their faction, failed not to embrace the same means of rewarding them.
In such times, it was not over uncharitable to suppose that the statesman, practised in courts of law, and a powerful member of a triumphant cabal, might find and use means of advantage over his less skilful and less favoured adversary; and if it had been supposed that Sir William Ashton’s conscience had been too delicate to profit by these advantages, it was believed that his ambition and desire of extending his wealth and consequence found as strong a stimulus in the exhortations of his lady as the daring aim of Macbeth in the days of yore.
And yet, with all these qualities to excite respect, Lady Ashton was seldom mentioned in the terms of love or affection.
With her inferiors these feelings were mingled with fear; an impression useful to her purposes, so far as it enforced ready compliance with her requests and implicit obedience to her commands, but detrimental, because it cannot exist with affection or regard.
But there was something under all this which rung false and hollow; and to those who watched this couple with close, and perhaps malicious, scrutiny it seemed evident that, in the haughtiness of a firmer character, higher birth, and more decided views of aggrandisement, the lady looked with some contempt on her husband, and that he regarded her with jealous fear, rather than with love or admiration.
His appearance was grave and even noble, well becoming one who held an high office in the state; and it was not save after long and intimate conversation with him upon topics of pressing and personal interest, that a stranger could have discovered something vacillating and uncertain in his resolutions; an infirmity of purpose, arising from a cautious and timid disposition, which, as he was conscious of its internal influence on his mind, he was, from pride as well as policy, most anxious to conceal from others.
He stopped, therefore, and listened, while the silver tones of Lucy Ashton’s voice mingled with the accompaniment in an ancient air, to which some one had adapted the following words: “Look not thou on beauty’s charming, Sit thou still when kings are arming, Taste not when the wine-cup glistens, Speak not when the people listens, Stop thine ear against the singer, From the red gold keep thy finger, Vacant heart, and hand, and eye, Easy live and quiet die.” The sounds ceased, and the Keeper entered his daughter’s apartment.
The expression of the countenance was in the last degree gentle, soft, timid, and feminine, and seemed rather to shrink from the most casual look of a stranger than to court his admiration.
Left to the impulse of her own taste and feelings, Lucy Ashton was peculiarly accessible to those of a romantic cast.
Her secret delight was in the old legendary tales of ardent devotion and unalterable affection, chequered as they so often are with strange adventures and supernatural horrors.
Her politic, wary, and worldly father felt for her an affection the strength of which sometimes surprised him into an unusual emotion.
Her elder brother, who trode the path of ambition with a haughtier step than his father, had also more of human affection.
Her mother alone did not feel that distinguished and predominating affection with which the rest of the family cherished Lucy.
Her eldest son was the more partially beloved by his mother because, contrary to the usual custom of Scottish families of distinction, he had been named after the head of the house.
Poor Lucy is unfit for courts or crowded halls.
The hour will be a happy one which disposes her hand in marriage to some one whose energy is greater than her own, or whose ambition is of as low an order.” So meditated a mother to whom the qualities of her children’s hearts, as well as the prospect of their domestic happiness, seemed light in comparison to their rank and temporal greatness.
But, like many a parent of hot and impatient character, she was mistaken in estimating the feelings of her daughter, who, under a semblance of extreme indifference, nourished the germ of those passions which sometimes spring up in one night, like the gourd of the prophet, and astonish the observer by their unexpected ardour and intensity.
Into this romantic region the father and daughter proceeded, arm in arm, by a noble avenue overarched by embowering elms, beneath which groups of the fallow-deer were seen to stray in distant perspective.
He was but sixteen then, bless his heart!” “And is he as ready with the gun as with the couteau?” said Sir William.
She is blind, poor old soul, but when she speaks to you, you would think she has some way of looking into your very heart.
I was here the wife of an upright and affectionate husband for more than twenty years; I was here the mother of six promising children; it was here that God deprived me of all these blessings; it was here they died, and yonder, by yon ruined chapel, they lie all buried.
I had no country but theirs while they lived; I have none but theirs now they are no more.” “But your house,” said the Lord Keeper, looking at it, “is miserably ruinous?” “Do, my dear father,” said Lucy, eagerly, yet bashfully, catching at the hint, “give orders to make it better; that is, if you think it proper.” “It will last my time, my dear Miss Lucy,” said the blind woman; “I would not have my lord give himself the least trouble about it.” “But,” said Lucy, “you once had a much better house, and were rich, and now in your old age to live in this hovel!” “It is as good as I deserve, Miss Lucy; if my heart has not broke with what I have suffered, and seen others suffer, it must have been strong enough, and the rest of this old frame has no right to call itself weaker.” “You have probably witnessed many changes,” said the Lord Keeper; “but your experience must have taught you to expect them.” “It has taught me to endure them, my lord,” was the reply.
You had reason, doubtless, to love them, and I respect your gratitude.
But paternal tenderness, “love strong as death,” sustained him.
She always appeared and disappeared close by the fountain, with which, therefore, her lover judged she had some inexplicable connexion.
In the course of his confession, the Baron of Ravenswood entrusted the hermit with the secret of this singular amour, and Father Zachary drew the necessary and obvious consequence that his patron was enveloped in the toils of Satan, and in danger of destruction, both to body and soul.
The lover listened with obstinate incredulity; and it was not until worn out by the obstinacy of the anchoret that he consented to put the state and condition of his mistress to a certain trial, and for that purpose acquiesced in Zachary’s proposal that on their next interview the vespers bell should be rung half an hour later than usual.
The hermit maintained and bucklered his opinion, by quotations from _Malleus Malificarum, Sprengerus, Remigius_, and other learned demonologists, that the Evil One, thus seduced to remain behind the appointed hour, would assume her true shape, and, having appeared to her terrified lover as a fiend of hell, would vanish from him in a flash of sulphurous lightning.
No change took place upon the nymph’s outward form; but as soon as the lengthening shadows made her aware that the usual hour of the vespers chime was passed, she tore herself from her lover’s arms with a shriek of despair, bid him adieu for ever, and, plunging into the fountain, disappeared from his eyes.
Beautiful and pale as the fabulous Naiad in the last agony of separation from her lover, she was seated so as to rest with her back against a part of the ruined wall, while her mantle, dripping with the water which her protector had used profusely to recall her senses, clung to her slender and beautifully proportioned form.
She had never happened to see a young man of mien and features so romantic and so striking as young Ravenswood; but had she seen an hundred his equals or his superiors in those particulars, no one else would have been linked to her heart by the strong associations of remembered danger and escape, of gratitude, wonder, and curiosity.
“The Lord Keeper has got all his estates; he has not a cross to bless himself with.” On which the ancient Lord Turntippet replied, “If he hasna gear to fine, He ha shins to pine.
He has parts and address, as well as courage and talents, and will present himself abroad like a young man of head as well as heart, who knows something more than the speed of a horse or the flight of a hawk.
“But don’t be angry; you know you will not fight, and so it is as well to leave your hilt in peace and quiet, and tell me in sober guise how you drew the Master into your confidence?” “By flattering his love of vengeance, Bucklaw,” answered Craigengelt.
Stay, let me see; ay, I would come out in Alexander: Thus from the grave I rise to save my love, Draw all your swords, and quick as lightning move.
When I rush on, sure none will dare to stay: ’Tis love commands, and glory leads the way.” As with a voice of thunder, and his hand upon his sword, Bucklaw repeated the ranting couplets of poor Lee, Craigengelt re-entered with a face of alarm.
When I repair to foreign courts, I shall not need the introduction of an intriguing adventurer, nor is it necessary for me to set value on the friendship of a hot-headed bully.” With these words, and without waiting for an answer, he left the apartment, remounted his horse, and was heard to ride off.
Now, Billy Berwick, keep good heart, And of thy talking let me be; But if thou art a man, as I am sure thou art, Come over the dike and fight with me.
Your very look and manner would have frightened the old man to death.” “Consider the provocation,” answered Ravenswood—“consider the ruin and death procured and caused by his hard-hearted cruelty—an ancient house destroyed, an affectionate father murdered!
“I am wae ye suld hae stude waiting at your ain gate; but wha wad hae thought o’ seeing ye sae sune, and a strange gentleman with a—(Here he exclaimed apart, as it were, and to some inmate of the tower, in a voice not meant to be heard by those in the court)—Mysie—Mysie, woman!
Glad at the heart to see more of comfort than the castle had yet seemed to offer, Bucklaw rubbed his hands heartily over the fire, and now listened with more complacency to the apologies which the Master of Ravenswood offered.
With such scenes of calm sublimity the human heart sympathises even in its most disturbed moods, and deeds of honour and virtue are inspired by their majestic influence.
We’ll mak shift, an it like your honour—we’ll mak shift; keep your heart abune, for the house sall haud its credit as lang as auld Caleb is to the fore.” The entertainment which the old man’s exertions of various kinds enabled him to present to the young gentlemen for three or four days was certainly of no splendid description, but it may readily be believed it was set before no critical guests; and even the distresses, excuses, evasions, and shifts of Caleb afforded amusement to the young men, and added a sort of interest to the scrambling and irregular style of their table.
Her looks of grateful acknowledgment, her words of affectionate courtesy, had been repelled with something which approached to disdain; and if the Master of Ravenswood had sustained wrongs at the hand of Sir William Ashton, his conscience told him they had been unhandsomely resented towards his daughter.
The sweetness of her voice, the delicacy of her expressions, the vivid glow of her filial affection, embittered his regret at having repulsed her gratitude with rudeness, while, at the same time, they placed before his imagination a picture of the most seducing sweetness.

And in which hope we heartily write ourself, “Right Honourable, “Your loving cousin, “A——.
As social life is better protected, its comforts will become too dear to be hazarded without some better reasons than speculative politics.” “It is fine talking,” answered Bucklaw; “but my heart is with the old song— To see good corn upon the rigs, And a gallow built to hang the Whigs, And the right restored where the right should be.
Looking down at them from the Warden’s Tower, I could but see them glent by wi’ their bridles ringing and their feathers fluttering, like the court of Elfland.” “Well, well, Caleb,” replied the Master, “help me on with my cloak, and hand me my sword-belt.
Taking unto himself heart of grace (to use his own phrase), he did at length summon up resolution enough to give the fair huntress good time of the day, and trust that her sport had answered her expectation.
When Ravenswood, who followed a short pace behind his friend, saw that the stag had fallen, his temporary ardour for the chase gave way to that feeling of reluctance which he endured at encountering in his fallen fortunes the gaze whether of equals or inferiors.
“The deil be in me,” said Caleb, taking heart in spite of this new invasion of Philistines, “if they shall beat me yet!
At this moment the clang of the portal was heard, a sound at which the stranger started, stepped hastily to the window, and looked with an air of alarm at Ravenswood, when he saw that the gate of the court was shut, and his domestics excluded.
“I perceive,” he said, “that Sir William Ashton is unwilling to announced himself in the Castle of Wolf’s Crag.” “I had hoped it was unnecessary,” said the Lord Keeper, relieved from his silence, as a spectre by the voice of the exorcist, “and I am obliged to you, Master of Ravenswood, for breaking the ice at once, where circumstances—unhappy circumstances, let me call them—rendered self-introduction peculiarly awkward.” “And I am not then,” said the Master of Ravenswood, gravely, “to consider the honour of this visit as purely accidental?” “Let us distinguish a little,” said the Keeper, assuming an appearance of ease which perhaps his heart was a stranger to; “this is an honour which I have eagerly desired for some time, but which I might never have obtained, save for the accident of the storm.
“Lucy, my love,” he said, raising her and leading her towards Ravenswood, “lay aside your mask, and let us express our gratitude to the Master openly and barefaced.” “If he will condescend to accept it,” was all that Lucy uttered; but in a tone so sweetly modulated, and which seemed to imply at once a feeling and a forgiving of the cold reception to which they were exposed, that, coming from a creature so innocent and so beautiful, her words cut Ravenswood to the very heart for his harshness.
He next inquired after Bucklaw, and understanding he was at the change-house with the huntsmen and some companions, he desired Caleb to call there, and acquaint him how he was circumstanced at Wolf’s Crag; to intimate to him that it would be most convenient if he could find a bed in the hamlet, as the elder guest must necessarily be quartered in the secret chamber, the only spare bedroom which could be made fit to receive him.
They might be, on the whole, termed independent, a circumstance peculiarly galling to Caleb, who had been wont to exercise over them the same sweeping authority in levying contributions which was exercised in former times in England, when “the royal purveyors, sallying forth from under the Gothic portcullis to purchase provisions with power and prerogative, instead of money, brought home the plunder of an hundred markets, and all that could be seized from a flying and hiding country, and deposited their spoil in an hundred caverns.” Caleb loved the memory and resented the downfall of that authority, which mimicked, on a petty scale, the grand contributions exacted by the feudal sovereigns.
It’s no that the venison is actually needfu’,” he added, detaining his colleague by the button, “to make up the dinner; but as a compliment to the hunters, ye ken; and, Mr. Lockhard, if they offer ye a drink o’ yill, or a cup o’ wine, or a glass o’ brandy, ye’ll be a wise man to take it, in case the thunner should hae soured ours at the castle, whilk is ower muckle to be dreaded.” He then permitted Lockhard to depart; and with foot heavy as lead, and yet far lighter than his heart, stepped on through the unequal street of the straggling village, meditating on whom he ought to make his first attack.
But he married a bonny young quean, Jean Lightbody, auld Lightbody’s daughter, him that was in the steading of Loup-the-Dyke; and auld Lightbody was married himsell to Marion, that was about my lady in the family forty years syne.
Her mother, old Luckie Loup-the-Dyke, “a canty carline” as was within twenty miles of her, according to the unanimous report of the _cummers_, or gossips, sat by the fire in the full glory of a grogram gown, lammer beads, and a clean cockernony, whiffing a snug pipe of tobacco, and superintending the affairs of the kitchen; for—sight more interesting to the anxious heart and craving entrails of the desponding seneschal than either buxom dame or canty cummer—there bubbled on the aforesaid bickering fire a huge pot, or rather cauldron, steaming with beef and brewis; while before it revolved two spits, turned each by one of the cooper’s apprentices, seated in the opposite corners of the chimney, the one loaded with a quarter of mutton, while the other was graced with a fat goose and a brace of wild ducks.
Wolf’s Crag was the court of the barony, Caleb prime minister at Wolf’s Crag; and it has ever been remarked that, though the masculine subject who pays the taxes sometimes growls at the courtiers by whom they are imposed, the said courtiers continue, nevertheless, welcome to the fair sex, to whom they furnish the newest small-talk and the earliest fashions.
Ne’er a bit but she looks far better than when she married Gilbert, and then she was the bonniest lass in our parochine and the neist till’t.
First, he would not heart it, and faced his companions down, that it was the echo of the wind; then he said it was not worth stopping for; and, at length, halting reluctantly, as the figure of the horseman appeared through the shades of the evening, he bent up his whole soul to the task of defending his prey, threw himself into an attitude of dignity, advanced the spit, which in his grasp might with its burden seem both spear and shield, and firmly resolved to die rather than surrender it.
“A vassal scarce held a calf or a lamb his ain, till he had first asked if the Lord of Ravenswood was pleased to accept it; and they were obliged to ask the lord’s consent before they married in these days, and mony a merry tale they tell about that right as weel as others.
The Lord Keeper was a veteran statesman, well acquainted with courts and cabinets, and intimate with all the various turns of public affairs during the last eventful years of the 17th century.
I am not sure whether the pride of being found to outbalance, in virtue of his own personal merit, all the disadvantages of fortune, did not make as favourable an impression upon the haughty heart of the Master of Ravenswood as the conversation of the father and the beauty of Lucy Ashton.
“It is necessary,” continued the Lord Keeper, “and proper that you should understand, that there have been many points betwixt us, in which, although I judged it proper that there should be an exact ascertainment of my legal rights by the decree of a court of justice, yet it was never my intention to press them beyond the verge of equity.” “My lord,” said the Master of Ravenswood, “it is unnecessary to pursue this topic farther.
He felt as if he could neither forgive him in the one character, nor follow forth his vengeance in the other, but that he was making a base and dishonourable composition betwixt his resentment against the father and his affection for his daughter.
He inquired with seeming interest, whether the proceedings in Sir William’s complicated litigation with the Ravenswood family were out of court, and settled without the possibility of appeal.
He pointed out to him, by unanswerable arguments, that some of the most important points which had been decided in his favour against the house of Ravenswood were liable, under the Treaty of Union, to be reviewed by the British House of Peers, a court of equity of which the Lord Keeper felt an instinctive dread.
The business which had long detained her in Edinburgh had afterwards induced her to travel to London, not without the hope that she might contribute her share to disconcert the intrigues of the Marquis at court; for she stood high in favour with the celebrated Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, to whom, in point of character, she bore considerable resemblance.
The alarm of the Lord Keeper became very serious; since the Claim of Right, the power of appealing from the decisions of the civil court to the Estates of Parliament, which had formerly been held incompetent, had in many instances been claimed, and in some allowed, and he had no small reason to apprehend the issue, if the English House of Lords should be disposed to act upon an appeal from the Master of Ravenswood “for remeid in law.” It would resolve into an equitable claim, and be decided, perhaps, upon the broad principles of justice, which were not quite so favourable to the Lord Keeper as those of strict law.
Besides, judging, though most inaccurately, from courts which he had himself known in the unhappy times preceding the Scottish Union, the Keeper might have too much right to think that, in the House to which his lawsuits were to be transferred, the old maxim might prevail which was too well recognised in Scotland in former times: “Show me the man, and I’ll show you the law.” The high and unbiased character of English judicial proceedings was then little known in Scotland, and the extension of them to that country was one of the most valuable advantages which it gained by the Union.
But although he thought, not unreasonably, that only desperate circumstances drove men on desperate measures, it was not without a secret terror, which shook his heart within him, that he first felt himself inclosed within the desolate Tower of Wolf’s Crag; a place so well fitted, from solitude and strength, to be a scene of violence and vengeance.
It is not here, where my father died of a broken heart, that I can with decency or temper investigate the cause of his distress.
Yet it would seem he was, in fairness, entitled to some premonition respecting the grounds upon which the Master proposed to impugn the whole train of legal proceedings, which had been so well and ripely advised in the only courts competent.” “Sir William Ashton,” answered the Master, with warmth, “the lands which you now occupy were granted to my remote ancestor for services done with his sword against the English invaders.
Then, since we were mutually mistaken in each other, why should not the young nobleman be willing to listen to the old lawyer, while, at least, he explains the points of difference betwixt them?” “No, my lord,” answered Ravenswood; “it is in the House of British Peers, whose honour must be equal to their rank—it is in the court of last resort that we must parley together.
and equal arms!” repeated Ravenswood, who, the reader will recollect, had no reason to suppose he had given the slightest offence to his late intimate; “upon my word, Captain Craigengelt, either you have invented the most improbable falsehood that ever came into the mind of such a person, or your morning draught has been somewhat of the strongest.
We could not, perhaps, have changed parts; at least I should have made a very sorry _Tauridor_, and you, my good Master, though your cause is so excellent, might have pleaded it perhaps worse yourself than I who acted for you before the council.” “My generous friend!” said Ravenswood; and with that brief word, which the Keeper had often lavished upon him, but which he himself now pronounced for the first time, he gave to his feudal enemy the full confidence of an haughty but honourable heart.
His prepossessions accordingly, however obstinate, were of a nature to give way before love and gratitude; and the real charms of the daughter, joined to the supposed services of the father, cancelled in his memory the vows of vengeance which he had taken so deeply on the eve of his father’s funeral.
And it was not merely during a few minutes that Sir William Ashton looked upon their marriage as a probable and even desirable event, for a full hour intervened ere his imagination was crossed by recollection of the Master’s poverty, and the sure displeasure of Lady Ashton.
He himself was supposed to have admitted this in effect, when, long after the catastrophe of their love, he used to warn his hearers against permitting their feelings to obtain an ascendency over their judgment, and affirm, that the greatest misfortune of his life was owing to a very temporary predominance of sensibility over self-interest.
But keep your ain state wi’ them—I ken the race o’ them weel—they will think the mair o’ ye.” “Why, now, you go father than I do, Caleb,” said the Master, drowning a certain degree of consciousness in a forced laugh; “you are for marrying me into a family that you will not allow me to visit, how this?
Lucy smiled on the old man with her usual sweetness, bade him adieu, and deposited her guerdon with a grace of action and a gentleness of accent which could not have failed to have won the faithful retainer’s heart, but for Thomas the Rhymer, and the successful lawsuit against his master.
Wisely saith the holy man, ‘By this also you may know that woman hath dominion over all men’; and without this lass would not our ruin have been a’thegither fulfilled.” With a heart fraught with such sad auguries did Caleb return to his necessary duties at Wolf’s Crag, as soon as he could no longer distinguish the object of his anxiety among the group of riders, which diminished in the distance.
In his heart the Lord Keeper rejoiced at having conciliated an adversary so formidable, while, with a mixture of pleasure and anxiety, he anticipated the great things his young companion might achieve, were the breath of court-favour to fill his sails.
The contrast pressed so strongly upon the Master’s heart as to awaken some of the sterner feelings with which he had been accustomed to regard the new lord of his paternal domain, and to impress his countenance with an air of severe gravity, when, alighted from his horse, he stood in the hall no longer his own, surrounded by the numerous menials of its present owner.
Yet reason tells us, parents are o’erseen, When with too strict a rein they do hold in Their child’s affection, and control that love, Which the high powers divine inspire them with.
Yet she made an effort to turn the conversation, and she succeeded; for the Master also had advanced farther than he intended, and his conscience had instantly checked him when he found himself on the verge of speaking of love to the daughter of Sir William Ashton.
Necessity is a stern but an excellent schoolmistress, and she that has lost her sight must collect her information from other sources.” “Well, you hear a man’s step, I grant it,” said Lucy; “but why, Alice, may it not be my father’s?” “The pace of age, my love, is timid and cautious: the foot takes leave of the earth slowly, and is planted down upon it with hesitation; it is the hasty and determined step of youth that I now hear, and—could I give credit to so strange a thought—I should say is was the step of a Ravenswood.” “This is indeed,” said Ravenswood, “an acuteness of organ which I could not have credited had I not witnessed it.
She then said to Ravenswood: “And you, too, are angry with me for my love?
or do you suppose me so foolish, that I cannot walk by a young lady’s side without plunging headlong in love with her?” “My thoughts,” replied Alice, “are my own; and if my mortal sight is closed to objects present with me, it may be I can look with more steadiness into future events.
on the verge of the grave, dare you urge the son of your master to blood and to revenge?” “God forbid!” said Alice, solemnly; “and therefore I would have you depart these fatal bounds, where your love, as well as your hatred, threatens sure mischief, or at least disgrace, both to yourself and others.
“Let it remain an instant on the ground,” said Alice, as the Master stooped to raise it; “and believe me, that piece of gold is an emblem of her whom you love; she is as precious, I grant, but you must stoop even to abasement before you can win her.
Lucy Ashton loves you, Lord of Ravenswood!” “It is impossible,” said the Master.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>If you remain an hour under Sir William Ashton’s roof without the resolution to marry his daughter, you are a villain; if with the purpose of allying yourself with kin, you are an infatuated and predestined fool.” So saying, the old blind woman arose, assumed her staff, and, tottering to her hut, entered it and closed the door, leaving Ravenswood to his own reflections.
Lovelier in her own retired abode ....than Naiad by the side Of Grecian brook—or Lady of the Mere Lone sitting by the shores of old romance.
Still, he felt that Alice spoke truth, and that his honour now required he should take an instant leave of Ravenswood Castle, or become a suitor of Lucy Ashton.
“I like this spot,” said Lucy at length, as if she found the silence embarrassing; “the bubbling murmur of the clear fountain, the waving of the trees, the profusion of grass and wild-flowers that rise among the ruins, make it like a scene in romance.
I think, too, I have heard it is a spot connected with the legendary lore which I love so well.” “It has been thought,” answered Ravenswood, “a fatal spot to my family; and I have some reason to term it so, for it was here I first saw Miss Ashton; and it is here I must take my leave of her for ever.” The blood, which the first part of this speech called into Lucy’s cheeks, was speedily expelled by its conclusion.
My preparations are already made—a sword and a cloak, and a bold heart and a determined hand.” Lucy covered her face her hands, and the tears, in spite of her, forced their way between her fingers.
The whole passed so suddenly, and arose so much out of the immediate impulse of the moment, that ere the Master of Ravenswood could reflect upon the consequences of the step which he had taken, their lips, as well as their hands, had pledged the sincerity of their affection.
I am sure he loves you—I think he will consent; but then my mother——!” She paused, ashamed to express the doubt she felt how far her father dared to form any positive resolution on this most important subject without the consent of his lady.
It was for your sake that I abjured these purposes of vengeance, though I scarce knew that such was the argument by which I was conquered, until I saw you once more, and became conscious of the influence you possessed over me.” “And why do you now,” said Lucy, “recall sentiments so terrible—sentiments so inconsistent with those you profess for me—with those your importunity has prevailed on me to acknowledge?” “Because,” said her lover, “I would impress on you the price at which I have bought your love—the right I have to expect your constancy.
But it is not too late to give it over: take back the faith and troth which you could not plight to me without suffering abatement of honour—let what is passed be as if it had not been—forget me; I will endeavour to forget myself.” “You do me injustice,” said the Master of Ravenswood—“by all I hold true and honourable, you do me the extremity of injustice; if I mentioned the price at which I have bought your love, it is only to show how much I prize it, to bind our engagement by a still firmer tie, and to show, by what I have done to attain this station in your regard, how much I must suffer should you ever break your faith.” “And why, Ravenswood,” answered Lucy, “should you think that possible?
“And never shall this leave my bosom,” said Lucy, as she hung the piece of gold round her neck, and concealed it with her handkerchief, “until you, Edgar Ravenswood, ask me to resign it to you; and, while I wear it, never shall that heart acknowledge another love than yours.” With like protestations, Ravenswood placed his portion of the coin opposite to his heart.
If she should adopt some romantic feelings towards Ravenswood, in which circumstances, or the positive and absolute opposition of Lady Ashton, might render it unadvisable to indulge her, the Lord Keeper conceived they might be easily superseded and annulled by a journey to Edinburgh, or even to London, a new set of Brussels lace, and the soft whispers of half a dozen lovers, anxious to replace him whom it was convenient she should renounce.
He loved the ostentatious display of his wealth, less as a man to whom habit has made it necessary, than as one to whom it is still delightful from its novelty.
“Be it so; a porter still bears but a burden, though the burden be of gold.” Lucy sighed; she perceived too plainly that her lover held in scorn the manners and habits of a father to whom she had long looked up as her best and most partial friend, whose fondness had often consoled her for her mother’s contemptuous harshness.
Thus, although their mutual affection seemed to increase rather than to be diminished as their characters opened more fully on each other, the feelings of each were mingled with some less agreeable ingredients.
Lucy felt a secret awe, amid all her affection for Ravenswood.
Rough and storm-worn I am; yet love me as Thou truly dost, I will love thee again With true and honest heart, though all unmeet To be the mate of such sweet gentleness.
Thus the very points in which they differed seemed, in some measure, to ensure the continuance of their mutual affection.
If, indeed, they had so fully appreciated each other’s character before the burst of passion in which they hastily pledged their faith to each other, Lucy might have feared Ravenswood too much ever to have loved him, and he might have construed her softness and docile temper as imbecility, rendering her unworthy of his regard.
But they stood pledged to each other; and Lucy only feared that her lover’s pride might one day teach him to regret his attachment; Ravenswood, that a mind so ductile as Lucy’s might, in absence or difficulties, be induced, by the entreaties or influence of those around her, to renounce the engagement she had formed.
“Do not fear it,” said Lucy, when upon one occasion a hint of such suspicion escaped her lover; “the mirrors which receive the reflection of all successive objects are framed of hard materials like glass or steel; the softer substances, when they receive an impression, retain it undefaced.” “This is poetry, Lucy,” said Ravenswood; “and in poetry there is always fallacy, and sometimes fiction.” “Believe me, then, once more, in honest prose,” said Lucy, “that, though I will never wed man without the consent of my parents, yet neither force nor persuasion shall dispose of my hand till you renounce the right I have given you to it.” The lovers had ample time for such explanations.
In the midst of all these various avocations, political and domestic, he seemed not to observe how much his daughter and his guest were thrown into each other’s society, and was censured by many of his neighbours, according to the fashion of neighbours in all countries, for suffering such an intimate connexion to take place betwixt two young persons.
“Is it serious or merry?” “Devilish serious, I assure you, and so they found it; for the Chevalier and I——” “Then I don’t like it at all,” said Bucklaw; “so fill a brimmer of my auld auntie’s claret, rest her heart!
“And now fill your glass again, Captain; I am going to make you happy; I am going to let you into a secret—a plot—a noosing plot—only the noose is but typical.” “A marrying matter?” said Craigengelt, and his jaw fell as he asked the question, for he suspected that matrimony would render his situation at Girnington much more precarious than during the jolly days of his patron’s bachelorhood.
“Ay, a marriage, man,” said Bucklaw; “but wherefore droops thy mighty spirit, and why grow the rubies on thy cheek so pale?
“There was my Lord Castle-Cuddy—we were hand and glove: I rode his horses, borrowed money both for him and from him, trained his hawks, and taught him how to lay his bets; and when he took a fancy of marrying, I married him to Katie Glegg, whom I thought myself as sure of as man could be of woman.
And Ravenswood’s dirty usage of me—shutting me out of doors to dine with the lackeys, because he had the Lord Keeper, forsooth, and his daughter, to be guests in his beggarly castle of starvation,—d—n me, Craigengelt, if I ever forgive him till I play him as good a trick!” “No more you should, if you are a lad of mettle,” said Craigengelt, the matter now taking a turn in which he could sympathise; “and if you carry this wench from him, it will break his heart.” “That it will not,” said Bucklaw; “his heart is all steeled over with reason and philosophy, things that you, Craigie, know nothing about more than myself, God help me.
Bucklaw, reformed from his prodigality, was just the sort of husband which she desired to have for her Shepherdess of Lammermoor; and while the marriage gave her an easy fortune, and a respectable country gentleman for her husband, Lady Ashton was of opinion that her destinies would be fully and most favourably accomplished.
Two cousins-german, six more distant kinsmen, his factor and his chamberlain, were all hollow votes; and the Girnington interest had always carried, betwixt love and fear, about as many more.
For this purpose, with slow and idle step, he paraded the terrace, which, flanked with a heavy stone battlement, stretched in front of the castle upon a level with the first story; while visitors found access to the court by a projecting gateway, the bartizan or flat-leaded roof of which was accessible from the terrace by an easy flight of low and broad steps.
“And if it be Lady Ashton,” said her lover to her in a low tone, “what can be the occasion of such alarm?
In the front of the castle, and beneath the portal which admitted guests into the inner court, stood Sir William Ashton, much perplexed in mind, his younger son and daughter beside him, and in their rear a train of attendants of various ranks, in and out of livery.
Taking hold of this respectable person’s arm as if to support her, Lady Ashton traversed the court, uttering a word or two by way of direction to the servants, but not one to Sir William, who in vain endeavoured to attract her attention, as he rather followed than accompanied her into the hall, in which they found the Marquis in close conversation with the Master of Ravenswood.
Why is it that, on your return after so long an absence, I am arraigned in this manner?” “Ask your own conscience, Sir William, what has prompted you to become a renegade to your political party and opinions, and led you, for what I know, to be on the point of marrying your only daughter to a beggarly Jacobite bankrupt, the inveterate enemy of your family to the boot.” “Why, what, in the name of common sense and common civility, would you have me do, madam?” answered her husband.
I see that more company is arriving; and, since I have the good fortune to renew my former acquaintance with Lady Ashton, I hope she will give me leave to avoid perilling what I prize so highly upon any disagreeable subject of discussion—at least till we have talked over more pleasant topics.” The lady smiled, courtesied, and gave her hand to the Marquis, by whom, with all the formal gallantry of the time, which did not permit the guest to tuck the lady of the house under the arm, as a rustic does his sweetheart at a wake, she was ushered to the eating-room.
On looking to the fountain, Ravenswood discerned a female figure, dressed in a white, or rather greyish, mantle, placed on the very spot on which Lucy Ashton had reclined while listening to the fatal tale of love.
His own were sad enough, without the exaggeration of supernatural terror, since he found himself transferred from the situation of a successful lover of Lucy Ashton, and an honoured and respected friend of her father, into the melancholy and solitary guardian of the abandoned and forsaken corpse of a common pauper.
But the burial duties rendered to the deceased are, to the Scottish peasant of either sex, a labour of love.
They prick us and they pine us, and they pit us on the pinnywinkles for witches; and, if I say my prayers backwards ten times ower, Satan will never gie me amends o’ them.” “Did ye ever see the foul thief?” asked her neighbour.
Be sure you know the grave.” “Ye’ll be ane o’ her English relations, I’se warrant,” said the hoary man of skulls; “I hae heard she married far below her station.
“Ye are welcome to your ain opinion, sir,” said the sexton; “but ye winna persuade me that he did his duty, either to himsell or to huz puir dependent creatures, in guiding us the gate he has done; he might hae gien us life-rent tacks of our bits o’ houses and yards; and me, that’s an auld man, living in yon miserable cabin, that’s fitter for the dead than the quick, and killed wi’ rheumatise, and John Smith in my dainty bit mailing, and his window glazen, and a’ because Ravenswood guided his gear like a fule!” “It is but too true,” said Ravenswood, conscience-struck; “the penalties of extravagance extend far beyond the prodigal’s own sufferings.” “However,” said the sexton, “this young man Edgar is like to avenge my wrangs on the haill of his kindred.” “Indeed?” said Ravenswood; “why should you suppose so?” “They say he is about to marry the daughter of Leddy Ashton; and let her leddyship get his head ance under her oxter, and see you if she winna gie his neck a thraw.
I find,” he proceeded, “there has been a love affair here, kinsman; and though I might blame you for not having communicated with me, as being in some degree the chief of your family——” “With your lordship’s permission,” said Ravenswood, “I am deeply grateful for the interest you are pleased to take in me, but _I_ am the chief and head of my family.” “I know it—I know it,” said the Marquis; “in a strict heraldic and genealogical sense, you certainly are so; what I mean is, that being in some measure under my guardianship——” “I must take the liberty to say, my lord——” answered Ravenswood, and the tone in which he interrupted the Marquis boded no long duration to the friendship of the noble relatives, when he himself was interrupted by the little sexton, who came puffing after them, to ask if their honours would choose music at the change-house to make up for short cheer.
True love, an thou be true, Thou has ane kittle part to play; For fortune, fashion, fancy, and thou, Maun strive for many a day.
I’ve kend by mony a friend’s tale, Far better by this heart of mine, What time and change of fancy avail A true-love knot to untwine.
“I wished to tell you, my good kinsman,” said the Marquis, “now that we are quit of that impertinent fiddler, that I had tried to discuss this love affair of yours with Sir William Ashton’s daughter.
As my engagement with that young lady has reached your lordship, I can only say, that you must necessarily suppose that I was aware of the objections to my marrying into her father’s family, and of course must have been completely satisfied with the reasons by which these objections are overbalanced, since I have proceeded so far in the matter.” “Nay, Master, if you had heard me out,” said his noble relation, “you might have spared that observation; for, without questioning that you had reasons which seemed to you to counterbalance every other obstacle, I set myself, by every means that it became me to use towards the Ashtons, to persuade them to meet your views.” “I am obliged to your lordship for your unsolicited intercession,” said Ravenswood; “especially as I am sure your lordship would never carry it beyond the bounds which it became me to use.” “Of that,” said the Marquis, “you may be confident; I myself felt the delicacy of the matter too much to place a gentleman nearly connected with my house in a degrading or dubious situation with these Ashtons.
But I pointed out all the advantages of their marrying their daughter into a house so honourable, and so nearly related with the first of Scotland; I explained the exact degree of relationship in which the Ravenswoods stand to ourselves; and I even hinted how political matters were like to turn, and what cards would be trumps next Parliament.
If she continues to prefer me in my poverty to the wealthier suitors whom her friends recommend, I may well make some sacrifice to her sincere affection: I may well surrender to her the less tangible and less palpable advantages of birth, and the deep-rooted prejudices of family hatred.
My bones are not so tender as hers, and I am resolved to occupy her apartment to-night, that I may judge how hard the couch is that love can soften.” “Your lordship may choose what penance you please,” said Ravenswood; “but I assure you, I should expect my old servant to hang himself, or throw himself from the battlements, should your lordship visit him so unexpectedly.
But I am as much at a loss as your lordship to account for so strong and brilliant a light as is now above Wolf’s Crag; the windows of the Tower are few and narrow, and those of the lower story are hidden from us by the walls of the court.
“Ay, to be sure it’s impossible but I should,” said Caleb; “and sae I’ll be the first to kiss ye, joe, and wish you, cooper, much joy of your preferment, naething doubting but ye ken wha are your friends, and _have_ helped ye, and _can_ help ye.
I thought it right to look a wee strange upon it at first,” added Caleb, “just to see if ye were made of the right mettle; but ye ring true, lad—ye ring true!” So saying, with a most lordly air he kissed the women, and abandoned his hand, with an air of serene patronage, to the hearty shake of Mr. Girder’s horn-hard palm.
The writer—the very attorney himself, such is the thirst of preferment—felt the force of the attraction, and taking an opportunity to draw Caleb into a corner, spoke, with affectionate regret, of the declining health of the sheriff-clerk of the county.
Often she interrupted herself, to express her regret that “my lord did not eat; that the Master was pyking a bare bane; that, to be sure, there was naething there fit to set before their honours; that Lord Allan, rest his saul, used to like a pouthered guse, and said it was Latin for a tass o’ brandy; that the brandy came frae France direct; for, for a’ the English laws and gaugers, the Wolf’s Hope brigs handa forgotten the gate to Dunkirk.” Here the cooper admonished his mother-in-law with his elbow, which procured him the following special notice in the progress of her speech: “Ye needna be dunshin that gate, John,” continued the old lady; “naebody says that _ye_ ken whar the brandy comes frae; and it wanda be fitting ye should, and you the Queen’s cooper; and what signifies’t,” continued she, addressing Lord Ravenswood, “to king, queen, or kaiser whar an auld wife like me buys her pickle sneeshin, or her drap brandy-wine, to haud her heart up?” Having thus extricated herself from her supposed false step, Dame Loup-the-Dyke proceeded, during the rest of the evening, to supply, with great animation, and very little assistance from her guests, the funds necessary for the support of the conversation, until, declining any further circulation of their glass, her guests requested her permission to retire to their apartments.
To counterbalance those foreign sentinels, there mounted guard on the other side of the mirror two stout warders of Scottish lineage; a jug, namely, of double ale, which held a Scotch pint, and a quaigh, or bicker, of ivory and ebony, hooped with silver, the work of John Girder’s own hands, and the pride of his heart.
But, notwithstanding this legal authority, John could not find in his heart to dim the splendour of his late hospitality by picketing anything in the nature of a gratuity.
While arrangements were making for departure, Ravenswood made blythe the heart of his ancient butler by informing him, cautiously however (for he knew Caleb’s warmth of imagination), of the probable change which was about to take place in his fortunes.
“It was doubtless,” he said, “a shame, a discredit, and a sin to harry the puir creatures, when the family were in circumstances to live honourably on their ain means; and there might be wisdom,” he added, “in giving them a while’s breathing-time at any rate, that they might be the more readily brought forward upon his honour’s future occasions.” This matter being settled, and having taken an affectionate farewell of his old domestic, the Master rejoined his noble relative, who was now ready to enter his carriage.
The two landladies, old and young, having received in all kindly greeting a kiss from each of their noble guests, stood simpering at the door of their house, as the coach and six, followed by its train of clattering horsemen, thundered out of the village.
Let the house be redd up, the broken meat set bye, and if there is ony thing totally uneatable, let it be gien to the puir folk; and, gude mother and wife, I hae just ae thing to entreat ye, that ye will never speak to me a single word, good or bad, anent a’ this nonsense wark, but keep a’ your cracks about it to yoursells and your kimmers, for my head is weel-nigh dung donnart wi’ it already.” As John’s authority was tolerably absolute, all departed to their usual occupations, leaving him to build castles in the air, if he had a mind, upon the court favour which he had acquired by the expenditure of his worldly substance.
Having no other means of making peace with the higher powers, he returned home sorrowful and malcontent, complaining to his confidants, “That every mutation or change in the state had hitherto been productive of some sma’ advantage to him in his ain quiet affairs; but that the present had—pize upon it!—cost him one of the best penfeathers o’ his wing.” Similar measures were threatened against others who had profited by the wreck of the fortune of Ravenswood; and Sir William Ashton, in particular, was menaced with an appeal to the House of Peers, a court of equity, against the judicial sentences, proceeding upon a strict and severe construction of the letter of the law, under which he held the castle and barony of Ravenswood.
It contained the strongest protestations of continued affection, and dwelt upon the approaching change of the writer’s fortunes, as chiefly valuable by tending to remove the impediments to their union.
Wishing you to lay these things to your heart for your own sake, so far as they may concern you, I pray you to take no farther notice of her who desires to remain your unknown servant, “MARGARET DOUGLAS, “otherwise ASHTON.” About two days after he had received this very unsatisfactory epistle, the Master of Ravenswood, while walking up the High Street of Edinburgh, was jostled by a person, in whom, as the man pulled off his hat to make an apology, he recognized Lockhard, the confidential domestic of Sir William Ashton.
Sir William spoke at length of his high value and regard for his dear young friend, the Master of Ravenswood, and of his very extreme high value and regard for the Marquis of A——, his very dear old friend; he trusted that any measures that they might adopt, in which he was concerned, would be carried on with due regard to the sanctity of decreets and judgments obtained _in foro contentioso;_ protesting, before men and angels, that if the law of Scotland, as declared in her supreme courts, were to undergo a reversal in the English House of Lords, the evils which would thence arise to the public would inflict a greater wound upon his heart than any loss he might himself sustain by such irregular proceedings.
In a postscript, Sir William said something more explicitly, which seemed to intimate that, rather than the law of Scotland should sustain a severe wound through his sides, by a reversal of the judgment of her supreme courts, in the case of the barony of Ravenswood, through the intervention of what, with all submission, he must term a foreign court of appeal, he himself would extrajudically consent to considerable sacrifices.
Will Miss Ashton’s tocher not weigh against any in Lothian?” “Granted,” answered Bucklaw; “but I care not a penny for her tocher; I have enough of my own.” “And the mother, that loves you like her own child?” “Better than some of her children, I believe,” said Bucklaw, “or there would be little love wared on the matter.” “And Colonel Sholto Douglas Ashton, who desires the marriage above all earthly things?” “Because,” said Bucklaw, “he expects to carry the county of —— through my interest.” “And the father, who is as keen to see the match concluded as ever I have been to win a main?” “Ay,” said Bucklaw, in the same disparaging manner, “it lies with Sir William’s policy to secure the next best match, since he cannot barter his child to save the great Ravenswood estate, which the English House of Lords are about to wrench out of his clutches.” “What say you to the young lady herself?” said Craigengelt; “the finest young woman in all Scotland, one that you used to be so fond of when she was cross, and now she consents to have you, and gives up her engagement with Ravenswood, you are for jibbing.
“And besides, here’s Ravenswood in the way still, do you think he’ll give up Lucy’s engagement?” “To be sure he will,” answered Craigengelt; “what good can it do him to refuse, since he wishes to marry another woman and she another man?” “And you believe seriously,” said Bucklaw, “that he is going to marry the foreign lady we heard of?” “You heard yourself,” answered Craigengelt, “what Captain Westenho said about it, and the great preparation made for their blythesome bridal.” “Captain Westenho,” replied Bucklaw, “has rather too much of your own cast about, Craigie, to make what Sir William would call a ‘famous witness.’ He drinks deep, plays deep, swears deep, and I suspect can lie and cheat a little into the bargain; useful qualities, Craigie, if kept in their proper sphere, but which have a little too much of the freebooter to make a figure in a court of evidence.” “Well, then,” said Craigengelt, “will you believe Colonel Douglas Ashton, who heard the Marquis of A—— say in a public circle, but not aware that he was within ear-shot, that his kinsman had made a better arrangement for himself than to give his father’s land for the pale-cheeked daughter of a broken-down fanatic, and that Bucklaw was welcome to the wearing of Ravenswood’s shaughled shoes.” “Did he say so, by heavens!” cried Bucklaw, breaking out into one of those incontrollable fits of passion to which he was constitutionally subject; “if I had heard him, I would have torn the tongue out of his throat before all his peats and minions, and Highland bullies into the bargain.
She started, dropped her needle, and repeated hastily, and almost in the same breath, the contradictory answers: “Yes, madam—no, my lady—I beg pardon, I did not hear.” “You need not blush, my love, and still less need you look so pale and frightened,” said Lady Ashton, coming forward; “we know that maiden’s ears must be slow in receiving a gentleman’s language; but you must remember Mr. Hayston speaks on a subject on which you have long since agreed to give him a favourable hearing.
You know how much your father and I have our hearts set upon an event so extremely desirable.” In Lady Ashton’s voice, a tone of impressive, and even stern, innuendo was sedulously and skilfully concealed under an appearance of the most affectionate maternal tenderness.
Lucy, my love,” she added, with that singular combination of suavity of tone and pointed energy which we have already noticed—“Lucy, my dearest love!
You will not, I am sure, my dear friend, think it is wrong that she should feel much delicacy upon this head; indeed, it concerns us all.” “Perfectly right—quite fair,” said Bucklaw, half humming, half speaking the end of the old song— “It is best to be off wi’ the old love Before you be on wi’ the new.
Sir William, who should know best, is clear upon this subject; and therefore, my dear Lucy——” “Madam,” said Lucy, with unwonted energy, “urge me no farther; if this unhappy engagement be restored, I have already said you shall dispose of me as you will; till then I should commit a heavy sin in the sight of God and man in doing what you require.” “But, my love, if this man remains obstinately silent——” “He will _not_ be silent,” answered Lucy; “it is six weeks since I sent him a double of my former letter by a sure hand.” “You have not—you could not—you durst not,” said Lady Ashton, with violence inconsistent with the tone she had intended to assume; but instantly correcting herself, “My dearest Lucy,” said she, in her sweetest tone of expostulation, “how could you think of such a thing?” “No matter,” said Bucklaw; “I respect Miss Ashton for her sentiments, and I only wish I had been her messenger myself.” “And pray how long, Miss Ashton,” said her mother, ironically, “are we to wait the return of your Pacolet—your fairy messenger—since our humble couriers of flesh and blood could not be trusted in this matter?” “I have numbered weeks, days, hours, and minutes,” said Miss Ashton; “within another week I shall have an answer, unless he is dead.
Let me ask you, Miss Ashton, in what terms your last letter was couched?” “Exactly in the same, madam,” answered Lucy, “which you dictated on a former occasion.” “When eight days have elapsed, then,” said her mother, resuming her tone of tenderness, “we shall hope, my dearest love, that you will end this suspense.” “Miss Ashton must not be hurried, madam,” said Bucklaw, whose bluntness of feeling did not by any means arise from want of good-nature; “messengers may be stopped or delayed.
“Dinna shut the cabinet yet,” said Henry, “for I must have some of your silver wire to fasten the bells to my hawk’s jesses,—and yet the new falcon’s not worth them neither; for do you know, after all the plague we had to get her from an eyrie, all the way at Posso, in Mannor Water, she’s going to prove, after all, nothing better than a rifler: she just wets her singles in the blood of the partridge, and then breaks away, and lets her fly; and what good can the poor bird do after that, you know, except pine and die in the first heather-cow or whin-bush she can crawl into?” “Right, Henry—right—very right,” said Luch, mournfully, holding the boy fast by the hand, after she had given him the wire he wanted; “but there are more riflers in the world than your falcon, and more wounded birds that seek but to die in quiet, that can find neither brake nor whin-bush to hide their head in.” “Ah!
Young women of the higher rank seldom mingled in society until after marriage, and, both in law and fact, were held to be under the strict tutelage of their parents, who were too apt to enforce the views for their settlement in life without paying any regard to the inclination of the parties chiefly interested.
On such occasions, the suitor expected little more from his bride than a silent acquiescence in the will of her parents; and as few opportunities of acquaintance, far less of intimacy, occurred, he made his choice by the outside, as the lovers in the Merchant of Venice select the casket, contented to trust to chance the issue of the lottery in which he had hazarded a venture.
The Marquis drove on, therefore, with the plentitude of ministerial authority, an appeal to the British House of Peers against those judgments of the courts of law by which Sir William became possessed of Ravenswood’s hereditary property.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I would have forfeited for him double the value of these lands, which he pursues with an ardour that shows he has forgotten how much I am implicated in the matter.” Lucy, however, could only murmur these things to herself, unwilling to increase the prejudices against her lover entertained by all around her, who exclaimed against the steps pursued on his account as illegal, vexatious, and tyrannical, resembling the worst measures in the worst times of the worst Stuarts, and a degradation of Scotland, the decisions of whose learned judges were thus subjected to the review of a court composed indeed of men of the highest rank, and who were not trained to the study of any municipal law, and might be supposed specially to hold in contempt that of Scotland.
Far more deeply skilled than her husband in the recesses of the human heart, she was aware that in this way she might strike a blow of deep and decisive vengeance upon one whom she esteemed as her mortal enemy; nor did she hesitate at raising her arm, although she knew that the wound must be dealt through the bosom of her daughter.
A report was wafted from the continent, founded, like others of the same sort, upon many plausible circumstances, but without any real basis, stating the Master of Ravenswood to be on the eve of marriage with a foreign lady of fortune and distinction.
Such a match was fitter and far more creditable for a spirited young fellow than a marriage with the daughter of an old Whig lawyer, whose chicanery had so nearly ruined his father.” The other party, of course, laying out of view the opposition which the Master of Ravenswood received from Miss Ashton’s family, cried shame upon his fickleness and perfidy, as if he had seduced the young lady into an engagement, and wilfully and causelessly abandoned her for another.
“The devil take me,” said he, “Lucy, if I fetch you any more of these tormenting messages again; for I like you better,” said he, kissing away the tears, “than the whole pack of them; and you shall have my grey pony to ride on, and you shall canter him if you like—ay, and ride beyond the village, too, if you have a mind.” “Who told you,” said Lucy, “that I am not permitted to ride where I please?” “That’s a secret,” said the boy; “but you will find you can never ride beyond the village but your horse will cast a shoe, or fall lame, or the cattle bell will ring, or something will happen to bring you back.
We have described her in the outset of our story as of a romantic disposition, delighting in tales of love and wonder, and readily identifying herself with the situation of those legendary heroines with whose adventures, for want of better reading, her memory had become stocked.
The worthy Captain, though without any precise communication with Lady Ashton, always acted most regularly and sedulously in support of her plans, and easily prevailed upon his friend, by dint of exaggeration of real circumstances and coming of others, to give explicit testimony to the truth of Ravenswood’s approaching marriage.
She was in many respects qualified for the part she played, which indeed could not be efficiently assumed without some knowledge of the human heart and passions.
Dame Gourlay perceived that Lucy shuddered at her external appearance, which we have already described when we found her in the death-chamber of blind Alice; and while internally she hated the poor girl for the involuntary horror with which she saw she was regarded, she commenced her operations by endeavouring to efface or overcome those prejudices which, in her heart, she resented as mortal offences.
When the diamonds are gone, what signifies the casket?” The tone of obstinacy with which this was said, her eyes flashing with unnatural light, and her hands firmly clenched, precluded the possibility of dispute; and the utmost length which Lady Ashton’s art could attain, only got her the privilege of dictating the letter, by which her daughter required to know of Ravenswood whether he intended to abide by or to surrender what she termed “their unfortunate engagement.” Of this advantage Lady Ashton so far and so ingeniously availed herself that, according to the wording of the letter, the reader would have supposed Lucy was calling upon her lover to renounce a contract which was contrary to the interests and inclinations of both.
But with all the more severe prejudices and principles of his sect, Bide-the-Bent possessed a sound judgment, and had learnt sympathy even in that very school of persecution where the heart is so frequently hardened.
“I cannot but opine, Miss Lucy,” he said, “that your worshipful lady mother hath in this matter an eagerness whilk, although it ariseth doubtless from love to your best interests here and hereafter, for the man is of persecuting blood, and himself a persecutor, a Cavalier or Malignant, and a scoffer, who hath no inheritance in Jesse; nevertheless, we are commanded to do justice unto all, and to fulfil our bond and covenant, as well to the stranger as to him who is in brotherhood with us.
At the recommendation of his pastor, Saunders readily undertook that the letter should be securely conveyed to the Master of Ravenswood at the court where he now resided.
It was further determined that the marriage should be solemnised upon the fourth day after signing the articles, a measure adopted by Lady Ashton, in order that Lucy might have as little time as possible to recede or relapse into intractability.
When the morning compliment of the bridegroom had been paid, Miss Ashton was left for some time to herself; her mother remarking, that the deeds must be signed before the hour of noon, in order that the marriage might be happy.
I am still Edgar Ravenswood.” She was silent, and he went on with increasing vehemence: “I am still that Edgar Ravenswood who, for your affection, renounced the dear ties by which injured honour bound him to seek vengeance.
“Are you willing to barter sworn faith, the exercise of free will, and the feelings of mutual affection to this wretched hypocritical sophistry?” “Hear him!” said Lady Ashton, looking to the clergyman—“hear the blasphemer!” “May God forgive him,” said Bide-the-Bent, “and enlighten his ignorance!” “Hear what I have sacrificed for you,” said Ravenswood, still addressing Lucy, “ere you sanction what has been done in your name.
Are you prepared to pierce my heart for its fidelity with the very weapon which my rash confidence entrusted to your grasp?” “Master of Ravenswood,” said Lady Ashton, “you have asked what questions you thought fit.
I will trouble you to return the corresponding tokens of my ill-placed confidence; I ought rather to say, of my egregious folly.” Lucy returned the scornful glance of her lover with a gaze from which perception seemed to have been banished; yet she seemed partly to have understood his meaning, for she raised her hands as if to undo a blue ribbon which she wore around her neck.
Ravenswood walked on with equal deliberation until he reached the head of the avenue, as if to show that he rather courted than avoided interruption.
It seemed doubtful even if she was conscious of it, for she was often observed to raise her hands to her neck, as if in search of the ribbon that had been taken from it, and mutter, in surprise and discontent, when she could not find it, “It was the link that bound me to life.” Notwithstanding all these remarkable symptoms, Lady Ashton was too deeply pledged to delay her daughter’s marriage even in her present state of health.
She therefore resolved that, if Lucy continued passive, the marriage should take place upon the day that had been previously fixed, trusting that a change of place, of situation, and of character would operate a more speedy and effectual cure upon the unsettled spirits of her daughter than could be attained by the slow measures which the medical men recommended.
As for the young men, Bucklaw and Colonel Ashton, they protested that, after what had happened, it would be most dishonourable to postpone for a single hour the time appointed for the marriage, as it would be generally ascribed to their being intimidated by the intrusive visit and threats of Ravenswood.
The marriage ceremony was performed according to the rites of the Presbyterian persuasion, to which Bucklaw of late had judged it proper to conform.
If grit folk gie poor bodies ony thing for coming to their weddings and burials, it suld be something that wad do them gude, I think.” “Their gifts,” said Ailsie Gourlay, “are dealt for nae love of us, nor out of respect for whether we feed or starve.
They wad gie us whinstanes for loaves, if it would serve their ain vanity, and yet they expect us to be as gratefu’, as they ca’ it, as if they served us for true love and liking.” “And that’s truly said,” answered her companion.
I like to pack the dead-dole in my lap and rin ower my auld rhyme— My loaf in my lap, my penny in my purse, Thou art ne’er the better, and I’m ne’er the worse.” “That’s right, Annie,” said the paralytic woman; “God send us a green Yule and a fat kirkyard!” “But I wad like to ken, Luckie Gourlay, for ye’re the auldest and wisest amang us, whilk o’ these revellers’ turn it will be to be streikit first?” “D’ye see yon dandilly maiden,” said Dame Gourlay, “a’ glistenin’ wi’ gowd and jewels, that they are lifting up on the white horse behind that hare-brained callant in scarlet, wi’ the lang sword at his side?” “But that’s the bride!” said her companion, her cold heart touched with some sort of compassion—“that’s the very bride hersell!
The marriage guests, on the present occasion, were regaled with a banquet of unbounded profusion, the relics of which, after the domestics had feasted in their turn, were distributed among the shouting crowd, with as many barrels of ale as made the hilarity without correspond to that within the castle.
Bucklaw afterwards went abroad, and never returned to Scotland; nor was he known ever to hint at the circumstances attending his fatal marriage.
By many readers this may be deemed overstrained, romantic, and composed by the wild imagination of an author desirous of gratifying the popular appetite for the horrible; but those who are read in the private family history of Scotland during the period in which the scene is laid, will readily discover, through the disguise of borrowed names and added incidents, the leading particulars of AN OWER TRUE TALE.
Whose mind’s so marbled, and his heart so hard, That would not, when this huge mishap was heard, To th’ utmost note of sorrow set their song, To see a gallant, with so great a grace, So suddenly unthought on, so o’erthrown, And so to perish, in so poor a place, By too rash riding in a ground unknown!
Ravenswood rejected his assistance by a mute sign, and having led the animal into the court, was just about to mount him, when the old domestic’s fear giving way to the strong attachment which was the principal passion of his mind, he flung himself suddenly at Ravenswood’s feet, and clasped his knees, while he exclaimed: “Oh, sir!

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The ruined and abandoned churchyard of Boldside has been long believed to be haunted by the Fairies, and the deep broad current of the Tweed, wheeling in moonlight round the foot of the steep bank, with the number of trees originally planted for shelter round the fields of the cottagers, but now presenting the effect of scattered and detached groves, fill up the idea which one would form in imagination for a scene that Oberon and Queen Mab might love to revel in.
Besides these circumstances of romantic locality, _mea paupera regna_ (as Captain Dalgetty denominates his territory of Drumthwacket) are bounded by a small but deep lake, from which eyes that yet look on the light are said to have seen the waterbull ascend, and shake the hills with his roar.
Indeed, the country around Melrose, if possessing less of romantic beauty than some other scenes in Scotland, is connected with so many associations of a fanciful nature, in which the imagination takes delight, as might well induce one even less attached to the spot than the author, to accommodate, after a general manner, the imaginary scenes he was framing to the localities to which he was partial.
The stream in the latter case is described as wandering down a romantic little valley, shifting itself, after the fashion of such a brook, from one side to the other, as it can most easily find its passage, and touching nothing in its progress that gives token of cultivation.
The real Allen, on the contrary, after traversing the romantic ravine called the Nameless Dean, thrown off from side to side alternately, like a billiard ball repelled by the sides of the table on which it has been played, and in that part of its course resembling the stream which pours down Glendearg, may be traced upwards into a more open country, where the banks retreat farther from each other, and the vale exhibits a good deal of dry ground, which has not been neglected by the active cultivators of the district.
On all occasions, the manners of the sovereign, the court, and the time, must give the tone to the peculiar description of qualities by which those who would attain the height of fashion must seek to distinguish themselves.
After the acknowledgment of the Queen&#39;s matchless perfections, the same devotion was extended to beauty as it existed among the lesser stars in her court, who sparkled, as it was the mode to say, by her reflected lustre.
This tone of romantic gallantry found a clever but conceited author, to reduce it to a species of constitution and form, and lay down the courtly manner of conversation, in a pedantic book, called Euphues and his England.
The extravagance of Euphuism, or a symbolical jargon of the same class, predominates in the romances of Calprenade and Scuderi, which were read for the amusement of the fair sex of France during the long reign of Louis XIV., and were supposed to contain the only legitimate language of love and gallantry.
But though such an unconnected course of adventures is what most frequently occurs in nature, yet the province of the romance writer being artificial, there is more required from him than a mere compliance with the simplicity of reality,--just as we demand from the scientific gardener, that he shall arrange, in curious knots and artificial parterres, the flowers which “nature boon” distributes freely on hill and dale.
what I respect in you is the light you have occasionally thrown on national antiquities, a study which I have commenced rather late in life, but to which I am attached with the devotions of a first love, because it is the only study I ever cared a farthing for.
I love it the better, because it was originally designed for Captain Grose, an excellent antiquary, though, like yourself, somewhat too apt to treat with levity his own pursuits: &#39;Tis said he was a soldier bred, And ane wad rather fa&#39;en than fled; But now he&#39;s quit the spurtle blade, And dog-skin wallet, And ta&#39;en the--antiquarian trade, I think, they call it.
Military zeal and ardour it was not, which made me stand out for a commission in the Scots Fusiliers, when my tutors and curators wished to bind me apprentice to old David Stiles, Clerk to his Majesty&#39;s Signet.
But, as for that overboiling valour, which I have heard many of _ours_ talk of, though I seldom observed that it influenced them in the actual affair---that exuberant zeal, which courts Danger as a bride,--truly my courage was of a complexion much less ecstatical.
Again, the love of a red coat, which, in default of all other aptitudes to the profession, has made many a bad soldier and some good ones, was an utter stranger to my disposition.
As for vanity, or love of finery for itself, I was such a stranger to it, that the difficulty was great to make me brush my coat, and appear in proper trim upon parade.
--Ye wadna have had me refuse to do the gentleman&#39;s bidding, and me a publican?” “Well, David,” said I, “I wish your virtuoso had taken a fitter hour--but as you say he is a gentleman--” “I&#39;se uphaud him that--the order speaks for itsell--a bottle of sherry--minched collops and a fowl--that&#39;s speaking like a gentleman, I trow?--That&#39;s right, Captain, button weel up, the night&#39;s raw--but the water&#39;s clearing for a&#39; that; we&#39;ll be on&#39;t neist night wi&#39; my Lord&#39;s boats, and we&#39;ll hae ill luck if I dinna send you a kipper to relish your ale at e&#39;en.” [Footnote: The nobleman whose boats are mentioned in the text, is the late kind and amiable Lord Sommerville, an intimate friend of the author.
And here I cannot but remark, that much of the stranger&#39;s arguments and inductions rested upon the authority of Mr. Deputy Register of Scotland, [Footnote: Thomas Thomson, Esq., whose well-deserved panegyric ought to be found on another page than one written by an intimate friend of thirty years&#39; standing.]
and his lucubrations; a gentleman whose indefatigable research into the national records is like to destroy my trade, and that of all local antiquaries, by substituting truth instead of legend and romance.
They are not, indeed, of that dynasty to restore which my ancestors struggled and suffered in vain; but the Providence who has conducted his present Majesty to the throne, has given him the virtues necessary to his time--firmness and intrepidity--a true love of his country, and an enlightened view of the dangers by which she is surrounded.--For the religion of these realms, I am contented to hope that the great Power, whose mysterious dispensation has rent them from the bosom of the church, will, in his own good time and manner, restore them to its holy pale.
“I believe,” said I, “all hidden treasure belongs either to the king or the lord of the soil; and as I have served his majesty, I cannot concern myself in any adventure which may have an end in the Court of Exchequer.” “The treasure I seek,” said the stranger, smiling, “will not be envied by princes or nobles,---it is simply the heart of an upright man.” “Ah!
He became so much interested in his own labours, that at length he resolved that the heart of one individual, the hero of his tale, should rest no longer in a land of heresy, now deserted by all his kindred.
Thither will I transport the heart of the good father, and beside the shrine which it shall occupy, I will construct my own grave.” “He must, indeed, have been an excellent man,” replied I, “whose memory, at so distant a period, calls forth such strong marks of regard.” “He was, as you justly term him,” said the ecclesiastic, “indeed excellent--excellent in his life and doctrine--excellent, above all, in his self-denied and disinterested sacrifice of all that life holds dear to principle and to friendship.
“You will be disappointed, my friend,” said the Benedictine, “if you expect any thing there but the mouldering dust of a human heart, closed in an inner case of porphyry.” I interposed as a neutral party, and taking the box from the sexton, reminded him, that if there were treasure concealed in it, still it could not become the property of the finder.
“I fancy,” he said, “gentlemen, your curiosity will not be satisfied,--perhaps I should say that your suspicions will not be removed,--unless I undo this casket; yet it only contains the mouldering remains of a heart, once the seat of the noblest thoughts.” He undid the box with great caution; but the shrivelled substance which it contained bore now no resemblance to what it might once have been, the means used having been apparently unequal to preserve its shape and colour, although they were adequate to prevent its total decay.
We were quite satisfied, notwithstanding, that it was, what the stranger asserted, the remains of a human heart; and David readily promised his influence in the village, which was almost co-ordinate with that of the bailie himself, to silence all idle rumours.
He was, moreover, pleased to favour us with his company to supper; and having taken the lion&#39;s share of two bottles of sherry, he not only sanctioned with his plenary authority the stranger&#39;s removal of the heart, but, I believe, would have authorized the removal of the Abbey itself, were it not that it happens considerably to advantage the worthy publican&#39;s own custom.
This introduced on both sides a degree of fury and animosity unknown to the earlier period of their history; and as religious scruples soon gave way to national hatred spurred by a love of plunder, the patrimony of the Church was no longer sacred from incursions on either side.
But its extreme solitude pressed on the heart; the traveller felt that uncertainty whither he was going, or in what so wild a path was to terminate, which, at times, strikes more on the imagination than the grand features of a show-scene, when you know the exact distance of the inn where your dinner is bespoke, and at the moment preparing.
The other boy ran instantly to fish it out again, threw it back to his brother, first taking out the cross, which, with great veneration, he kissed and put into his bosom.
Sergeant Brittson, do thou remain here till recalled--protect this family, as under assurance--do them no wrong, and suffer no wrong to be done to them, as thou wilt answer it.--Dame, Brittson is a married man, old and steady; feed him on what you will, but give him not over much liquor.” Dame Glendinning again offered refreshments, but with a faltering voice, and an obvious desire her invitation should not be accepted.
“There is a way,” said the shepherd, “but I kenna if she could bring her heart to it,--there&#39;s Simon Glendinning&#39;s widow of the glen yonder, has had assurance from the Southern loons, and nae soldier to steer them for one cause or other.
There is nae ane to stir it but the good neighbours, and they----” “For the love of God, goodman,” said his wife, in a remonstrating tone, “haud your peace!
She loved her husband for himself, and in his inestimable loss all lesser subjects of regret had ceased to interest her.
Besides, he led a wild and unsettled life, mingling in all feuds and forays, wherever there was a spear to be broken; he evinced no purpose of marrying, and the fate which he continually was braving might at length remove him from his usurped inheritance.
“Black-haired, black-eyed, with a peaked black beard,” said the child; “and many a fold of pearling round his neck, and hanging down his breast ower his breastplate; and he had a beautiful hawk, with silver bells, standing on his left hand, with a crimson silk hood upon its head--” “Ask her no more questions, for the love of God,” said the anxious menial to Elspeth, “but look to my leddy!” But the Lady of Avenel, taking Mary in her hand, turned hastily away, and, walking into the hall, gave them no opportunity of remarking in what manner she received the child&#39;s communication, which she thus cut short.
What Tibb thought of it appeared from her crossing herself repeatedly, and whispering into Elspeth&#39;s ear, “Saint Mary preserve us!--the lassie has seen her father!” When they reached the hall, they found the lady holding her daughter on her knee, and kissing her repeatedly.
Muckle wark there was to bring me to mysell again, and sair they tried to make me believe it was a trick of Father Nicolas and Simon between them, and that the arrow was to signify Cupid&#39;s shaft, as the Father called it; and mony a time Simon wad threep it to me after I was married--gude man, he liked not it should be said that he was seen out o&#39; the body!--But mark the end o&#39; it, Tibb; we were married, and the gray-goose wing was the death o&#39; him after a&#39;!” “As it has been of ower mony brave men,” said Tibb; “I wish there wasna sic a bird as a goose in the wide warld, forby the clecking that we hae at the burn-side.” “But tell me, Tibb,” said Dame Glendinning, “what does your leddy aye do reading out o&#39; that thick black book wi&#39; the silver clasps?--there are ower mony gude words in it to come frae ony body but a priest--An it were about Robin Hood, or some o&#39; David Lindsay&#39;s ballants, ane wad ken better what to say to it.
so that Dame Elspeth had no difficulty in possessing herself of the volume, although her heart all the while accused her of an ungenerous and an inhospitable part towards her friend and inmate.
But the church hath her ministers to gloze and to expound the same unto her faithful congregation; and this I say, not so much, my beloved brethren--I mean my beloved sister,” (for the Sacristan had got into the end of one of his old sermons,)--“This I speak not so much of the rectors, curates, and secular clergy, so called because they live after the fashion of the _seculum_ or age, unbound by those ties which sequestrate us from the world; neither do I speak this of the mendicant friars, whether black or gray, whether crossed or uncrossed; but of the monks, and especially of the monks Benedictine, reformed on the rule of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, thence called Cistercian, of which monks, Christian brethren--sister, I would say--great is the happiness and glory of the country in possessing the holy ministers of Saint Mary&#39;s, whereof I, though an unworthy brother, may say it hath produced more saints, more bishops, more popes--may our patrons make us thankful!--than any holy foundation in Scotland.
Wherefore--But I see Martin hath my mule in readiness, and I will but salute you with the kiss of sisterhood, which maketh not ashamed, and so betake me to my toilsome return, for the glen is of bad reputation for the evil spirits which haunt it.
Is it layman or priest that must float in your cove, Or lover who crosses to visit his love?
All that come to my cove are sunk, Priest or layman, lover or monk.” How long the damsel might have continued to sing, or where the terrified monk&#39;s journey might have ended, is uncertain.

ho!” for his reverence, as the reader may partly have observed, was one of those dull folks who love a quiet joke.
Dangerous it may be--feeble it must be--yet live it shall, the proud determination to serve the Church of which I am a member, and to combat the heresies by which she is assailed.” Thus spoke, at least thus thought, a man zealous according to his imperfect knowledge, confounding the vital interests of Christianity with the extravagant and usurped claims of the Church of Rome, and defending his cause with an ardour worthy of a better.
High fraught, also, with zeal against her unauthorized intrusion into the priestly function, by study of the Sacred Scriptures, he imagined to himself the answers which one of the modern school of heresy might return to him--the victorious refutation which should lay the disputant prostrate at the Confessor&#39;s mercy--and the healing, yet awful exhortation, which, under pain of refusing the last consolations of religion, he designed to make to the penitent, conjuring her, as she loved her own soul&#39;s welfare, to disclose to him what she knew of the dark mystery of iniquity, by which heresies were introduced into the most secluded spots of the very patrimony of the Church herself--what agents they had who could thus glide, as it were unseen, from place to place, bring back the volume which the Church had interdicted to the spots from which it had been removed under her express auspices; and, who, by encouraging the daring and profane thirst after knowledge forbidden and useless to the laity, had encouraged the fisher of souls to use with effect his old bait of ambition and vain-glory.
“This day,” he said, “I must not taste food until the sun go down, happy if, in so doing, I can expiate my own negligence--happier still, if my sufferings of this trifling nature, undertaken in pure faith and singleness of heart, may benefit the soul of the deceased.
Yet, dame,” he added, “I may not so far forget the living in my cares for the dead, as to leave behind me that book, which is to the ignorant what, to our first parents, the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil unhappily proved-excellent indeed in itself, but fatal because used by those to whom it is prohibited.” “Oh, blithely, reverend father,” said the widow of Simon Glendinning, “will I give you the book, if so be I can while it from the bairns; and indeed, poor things, as the case stands with them even now, you might take the heart out of their bodies, and they never find it out, they are sae begrutten.” [Footnote: _Begrutten_--over-weeped] “Give them this missal instead, good dame,” said the father, drawing from his pocket one which was curiously illuminated with paintings, “and I will come myself, or send one at a fitting time, and teach them the meaning of these pictures.” “The bonny images!” said Dame Glendinning, forgetting for an instant her grief in her admiration, “and weel I wot,” added she, “it is another sort of a book than the poor Lady of Avenel&#39;s; and blessed might we have been this day, if your reverence had found the way up the glen, instead of Father Philip, though the Sacristan is a powerful man too, and speaks as if he would ger the house fly abroad, save that the walls are gey thick.
where be ye all?--Christie, for the love of God, consider he is a man of Holy Kirk!” “I care not for his spear,” said the Sub-Prior; “if I am slain in defending the rights and privileges of my community, the Primate will know how to take vengeance.” “Let him look to himself,” said Christie, but at the same time depositing his lance against the wall of the tower; “if the Fife men spoke true who came hither with the Governor in the last raid, Norman Leslie has him at feud, and is like to set him hard.
For your master&#39;s proffered visit of three days, with such a company and retinue, I have no authority to reply to it; you must intimate your Chief&#39;s purpose to the Reverend Lord Abbot.” “That will cost me a farther ride,” said the man, “but it is all in the day&#39;s work.--How now, my lad,” said he to Halbert, who was handling the long lance which he had laid aside; “how do you like such a plaything?--will you go with me and be a moss-trooper?” “The Saints in their mercy forbid!” said the poor mother; and then, afraid of having displeased Christie by the vivacity of her exclamation, she followed it up by explaining, that since Simon&#39;s death she could not look on a spear or a bow, or any implement of destruction without trembling.
I will do battle for it.” “But see you, my love,” said the monk, amused with the resolute friendship manifested by the boy, “I do not take it; I only borrow it; and I leave in its place my own gay missal, as a pledge I will bring it again.” Edward opened the missal with eager curiosity, and glanced at the pictures with which it was illustrated.
The motion of something near him made the blood again run to his heart, and by a sudden effort he started up, and, looking around, saw to his relief that the noise was occasioned by the footsteps of his own mule.
The drawbridge was readily dropped at his first summons; and so much had he won upon the heart of the churlish warden, that Peter appeared himself with a lantern to show the Sub-Prior his way over the perilous pass.
I now who speak to you--I have ridden--before I was perched up here on this pillar betwixt wind and water--it may be thirty Scots miles before I broke my fast, and have had the red of a bramble rose in my cheek all the while--But will you taste some food, or a cup of distilled waters?” “I may not,” said Father Eustace, “being under a vow; but I thank you for your kindness, and pray you to give what I may not accept to the next poor pilgrim who comes hither pale and fainting, for so it shall be the better both with him here, and with you hereafter.” “By my faith, and I will do so,” said Peter Bridge-Ward, “even for thy sake--It is strange now, how this Sub-Prior gets round one&#39;s heart more than the rest of these cowled gentry, that think of nothing but quaffing and stuffing!--Wife, I say--wife, we will give a cup of distilled waters and a crust of bread unto the next pilgrim that comes over; and ye may keep for [Footnote: An old-fashioned name for an earthen jar for holding spirits.]
In the way, he had to commune with and subdue his own rebellious heart, an enemy, he was sensible, more formidable than any which the external powers of Satan could place in his way.
I give the Abbot an advantage over me which I shall never again recover, and Heaven only knows how he may abuse it, in his foolish simplicity, to the dishonour and loss of Holy Kirk.--But then, if I make not true confession of my shame, with what face can I again presume to admonish or restrain others?--Avow, proud heart,” continued he, addressing himself, “that the weal of Holy Church interests thee less in this matter than thine own humiliation--Yes, Heaven has punished thee even in that point in which thou didst deem thyself most strong, in thy spiritual pride and thy carnal wisdom.
When this villain came to the gate, accused by his own evil conscience, and crying out he had murdered thee, I thought that the pillar of our main aisle had fallen--no more shall a life so precious be exposed to such risks as occur in this border country; no longer shall one beloved and rescued of Heaven hold so low a station in the church as that of a poor Sub-Prior--I will write by express to the Primate for thy speedy removal and advancement.” “Nay, but let me understand,” said the Sub-Prior; “did this soldier say he had slain me?” “That he had transfixed you,” answered the Abbot, “in full career with his lance--but it seems he had taken an indifferent aim.
for that, and--for the love of thy gold crucifix,” said Christie of the Clinthill.
For instance, the Abbot seldom mentioned him to the other monks, without designing him our beloved Brother Eustace, poor man!--and now and then he used to warn the younger brethren against the snares of vainglory and spiritual pride, which Satan sets for the more rigidly righteous, with such looks and demonstrations as did all but expressly designate the Sub-Prior as one who had fallen at one time under such delusions.
When he spoke to Elspeth Glendinning of that which a mother best loves to hear--the proficiency and abilities of her son--she listened with a delighted ear.
“In a word,” she said, bursting into tears, “deprive me of Edward, good father, and ye bereave my house of prop and pillar; for my heart tells me that Halbert will take to his father&#39;s gates, and die his father&#39;s death.” When the conversation came to this crisis, the good-humoured monk was always content to drop the discussion for the time, trusting some opportunity would occur of removing her prejudices, for such he thought them, against Edward&#39;s proposed destination.
I trust, young man, that neither idleness, nor licentious pleasure, nor the love of worldly gain and worldly grandeur, the chief baits with which the great Fisher of souls conceals his hook, are the causes of your declining the career to which I would incite you.
Better for you that you were as grossly ignorant as the beasts which perish, that that the pride of knowledge should induce you to lend an ear to the voice of heretics.” Edward Glendinning listened to the rebuke with a downcast look, and failed not, when it was concluded, earnestly to vindicate himself from the charge of having pushed his studies into any subjects which the Church inhibited; and so the monk was left to form vain conjectures respecting the cause of his reluctance to embrace the monastic state.
And she loves me better than him--I am sure she does--for she comes of noble blood, and scorns sloth and cowardice.--And do I myself not stand here slothful and cowardly as any priest of them all?--Why should I fear to call upon this form--this shape?--Already have I endured the vision, and why not again?
Does my heart beat--do my hairs bristle, at the thought of calling up a painted shadow, and how should I face a band of Southrons in flesh and blood?
There&#39;s something in that ancient superstition, Which, erring as it is, our fancy loves.
and I taught thee the word and the spell, To waken me here by the Fairies&#39; Well, But thou hast loved the heron and hawk, More than to seek my haunted walk; And thou hast loved the lance and the sword, More than good text and holy word; And thou hast loved the deer to track, More than the lines and the letters black; And thou art a ranger of moss and of wood, And scornest the nurture of gentle blood.” “I will do so no longer, fair maiden,” said Halbert; “I desire to learn; and thou didst promise me, that when I did so desire, thou wouldst be my helper; I am no longer afraid of thy presence, and I am no longer regardless of instruction.” As he uttered these words, the figure of the White Maiden grew gradually as distinct as it had been at first; and what had well-nigh faded into an ill-defined and colourless shadow, again assumed an appearance at least of corporeal consistency, although the hues were less vivid, and the outline of the figure less distinct and defined--so at least it seemed to Halbert--than those of an ordinary inhabitant of earth.
Other thoughts have filled my mind, other thoughts have engaged my heart, within a brief period--and by Heaven, other occupations shall henceforward fill up my time.
I will learn the contents of that mysterious volume--I will learn why the Lady of Avenel loved it--why the priests feared, and would have stolen it--why thou didst twice recover it from their hands.--What mystery is wrapt in it?--Speak, I conjure thee!” The lady assumed an air peculiarly sad and solemn, as drooping her head, and folding her arms on her bosom, she replied: “Within that awful volume lies The mystery of mysteries!
What had late the symmetry of form, and the delicate, yet clear hues of feminine beauty, now resembled the flitting and pale ghost of some maiden who has died for love, as it is seen indistinctly and by moonlight, by her perjured lover.
“Speak!” he said, wildly tossing his arms, “speak yet again--be once more present, lovely vision!--thrice have I now seen thee, yet the idea of thy invisible presence around or beside me, makes my heart beat faster than if the earth yawned and gave up a demon.” But neither sound nor appearance indicated the presence of the White Lady, and nothing preternatural beyond what he had already witnessed, was again audible or visible.
The object of the Miller&#39;s visit to the Tower of Glendearg was like the purpose of those embassies which potentates send to each other&#39;s courts, partly ostensible, partly politic.
I have said enough to intimate that I talk not without book.
By turning and again turning these advantages over in her own mind, Elspeth at length came to be of opinion, that the only way to save her son Halbert from a life of “spur, spear, and snaffle,” as they called that of the border-riders, from the dint of a cloth-yard shaft, or the loop of an inch-cord, was, that he should marry and settle, and that Mysie Happer should be his destined bride.
True, Mysie, as the dame soon saw, was like to love dancing round a May-pole as well as managing a domestic establishment, and Halbert was like to break more heads than he would grind stacks of corn.
--And if they tax him with churl&#39;s blood, Edward might say, that, forby the old proverb, how Gentle deed Makes gentle bleid; yet, moreover, there comes no churl&#39;s blood from Glendinning or Brydone; for, says Edward--” The hoarse voice of the Miller at this moment recalled the dame from her reverie, and compelled her to remember that if she meant to realize her airy castle, she must begin by laying the foundation in civility to her guest and his daughter, whom she was at that moment most strangely neglecting, though her whole plan turned on conciliating their favour and good opinion, and that, in fact, while arranging matters for so intimate a union with her company, she was suffering them to sit unnoticed, and in their riding gear, as if about to resume their journey.
I have heard them baying in the glen all day.” “And if I had heard that music,” said the Miller, “it would have done my heart good, ay, and may be taken me two or three miles out of my road.
So that Mary Avenel, little loved because little known, was regarded with a mysterious awe, partly derived from fear of her uncle&#39;s moss-troopers, and partly from her own retired and distant habits, enhanced by the superstitious opinions of the time and country.
Mysie flew to the shot-window in the full ardour of unrestrained female curiosity.
The quaint, forced, and unnatural style which he introduced by his “Anatomy of Wit,” had a fashion as rapid as it was momentary--all the court ladies were his scholars, and to _parler Euphuisme_, was as necessary a qualification to a courtly gallant, as those of understanding how to use his rapier, or to dance a measure.
Scoff not its homeliness, nor that of its inmates--ye might long have abidden at the court of England, ere we had sought your favour, or cumbered you with our society.
And let me pray you in particular, lovely lady, that, according to the universal custom now predominant in our court, the garden of superior wits, you will exchange with me some epithet whereby you may mark my devotion to your service.
The winds of idle passion may indeed rudely agitate the bosom of the rude; but the heart of the courtier is polished to resist them.
Leaving this able substitute in the kitchen, and regretting that Mary Avenel was so brought up, that she could intrust nothing to her care, unless it might be seeing the great chamber strewed with rushes, and ornamented with such flowers and branches as the season afforded, Dame Elspeth hastily donned her best attire, and with a beating heart presented herself at the door of her little tower, to make her obeisance to the Lord Abbot as he crossed her humble threshold.
The inhabitants unanimously knelt down to kiss the hand of the Lord Abbot, a ceremony which even the monks were often condemned to.
A courtier extraordinary, who by diet Of meats and drinks, his temperate exercise, Choice music, frequent bath, his horary shifts Of shirts and waistcoats, means to immortalize Mortality itself, and makes the essence Of his whole happiness the trim of court.
When the Lord Abbot had suddenly and superciliously vanished from the eyes of his expectant vassals, the Sub-Prior made amends for the negligence of his principal, by the kind and affectionate greeting which he gave to all the members of the family, but especially to Dame Elspeth, her foster-daughter, and her son Edward.
“Benedicite!” said Abbot Boniface, “now marry fie upon these hard benches with all my heart--they are as uneasy as the _scabella_ of our novices.
So that you will consider, good Sir Piercie, our mutual in commodities, and forgive whatever you may find amiss.” “By my faith,” said Sir Piercie Shafton, “there is nothing to forgive--If you spiritual warriors have to submit to the grievous incommodities which your lordship narrates, it would ill become me, a sinful and secular man, to complain of a bed as hard as a board, of broth which relished as if made of burnt wool, of flesh, which, in its sable and singed shape, seemed to put me on a level with Richard Coeur-de-Lion,--when he ate up the head of a Moor carbonadoed, and of other viands savouring rather of the rusticity of this northern region.” “By the good Saints, sir,” said the Abbot, somewhat touched in point of his character for hospitality, of which he was in truth a most faithful and zealous professor, “it grieves me to the heart that you have found our vassals no better provided for your reception--Yet I crave leave to observe, that if Sir Piercie Shafton&#39;s affairs had permitted him to honour with his company our poor house of Saint Mary&#39;s, he might have had less to complain of in respect of easements.” “To give your lordship the reasons,” said Sir Piercie Shafton, “why I could not at this present time approach your dwelling, or avail myself of its well-known and undoubted hospitality, craves either some delay, or,” looking around him, “a limited audience.” The Lord Abbot immediately issued his mandate to the Refectioner: “Hie thee to the kitchen, Brother Hilarius, and there make inquiry of our brother the Kitchener, within what time he opines that our collation may be prepared, since sin and sorrow it were, considering the hardships of this noble and gallant knight, no whit mentioning or--weighing those we ourselves have endured, if we were now either to advance or retard the hour of refection beyond the time when the viands are fit to be set before us.” Brother Hilarius parted with an eager alertness to execute the will of his Superior, and returned with the assurance, that punctually at one afternoon would the collation be ready.
I remember not thou didst intimate its presence in thy hamper of vivers.” “So please your holiness and lordship,” said the Refectioner, “he is a son of the woman of the house who has shot it and sent it in--killed but now; yet, as the animal heat hath not left the body, the Kitchener undertakes it shall eat as tender as a young chicken--and this youth hath a special gift in shooting deer, and never misses the heart or the brain; so that the blood is not driven through the flesh, as happens too often with us.
Howbeit, Father Eustace is fully possessed of my confidence, and worthy of yours, and well may it be said of him, _Intravit in secretis nostris_.” Sir Piercie Shafton bowed to the reverend brethren, and, heaving a sigh, as if he would burst his steel cuirass, he thus commenced his speech:-- “Certes, reverend sirs, I may well heave such a suspiration, who have, as it were, exchanged heaven for purgatory, leaving the lightsome sphere of the royal court of England for a remote nook in this inaccessible desert--quitting the tilt-yard, where I was ever ready among my compeers to splinter a lance, either for the love of honour, or for the honour of love, in order to couch my knightly spear against base and pilfering besognios and marauders--exchanging the lighted halls, wherein I used nimbly to pace the swift coranto, or to move with a loftier grace in the stately galliard, for this rugged and decayed dungeon of rusty-coloured stone--quitting the gay theatre, for the solitary chimney-nook of a Scottish dog-house--bartering the sounds of the soul-ravishing lute, and the love-awaking viol-de-gamba, for the discordant squeak of a northern bagpipe--above all, exchanging the smiles of those beauties, who form a gay galaxy around the throne of England, for the cold courtesy of an untaught damsel, and the bewildered stare of a miller&#39;s maiden.
throne of love, and citadel of honour!--Ah!
But as I posted towards Alnwick, even with the speed of a star, which, darting from its native sphere, shoots wildly downwards, I was met at Northallerton by one Henry Vaughan, a servant of my right honourable kinsman, who showed me, that as then I might not with safety come to his presence, seeing that, in obedience to orders from his court, he was obliged to issue out letters for my incarceration.” “This,” said the Abbot, “seems but hard measure on the part of your honourable kinsman.” “It might be so judged, my lord,” replied Sir Piercie; “nevertheless, I will stand to the death for the honour of my Right Honourable Cousin of Northumberland.
Hitherto they have found no flaw in our raiment; but a party, friendly as well to the Queen of England, as to the heretical doctrines of the schismatical church, or even to worse and wilder forms of heresy, prevails now at the court of our sovereign, who dare not yield to her suffering clergy the protection she would gladly extend to them.” “My lord, and reverend sir,” said the knight, “I will gladly relieve you of my presence, while ye canvass this matter at your freedom; and to speak truly, I am desirous to see in what case the chamberlain of my noble kinsman hath found my wardrobe, and how he hath packed the same, and whether it has suffered from the journey--there are four suits of as pure and elegant device as ever the fancy of a fair lady doated upon, every one having a treble, and appropriate change of ribbons, trimmings, and fringes, which, in case of need, may as it were renew each of them, and multiply the four into twelve.--There is also my sad-coloured riding-suit, and three cut-work shirts with falling bands--I pray you, pardon me--I must needs see how matters stand with them without farther dallying.” Thus speaking, he left the room; and the Sub-Prior, looking after him significantly, added, “Where the treasure is will the heart be also.” “Saint Mary preserve our wits!” said the Abbot, stunned with the knight&#39;s abundance of words; “were man&#39;s brains ever so stuffed with silk and broadcloth, cut-work, and I wot not what besides!
The men of Scotland were once Scotsmen, firm and united in the love of their country, and throwing every other consideration aside when the frontier was menaced--now they are--what shall I call them--the one part French, the other part English, considering their dear native country merely as a prize-fighting stage, upon which foreigners are welcome to decide their quarrels.” “Benedictine!” replied the Abbot, “they are indeed slippery and evil times.” “And therefore,” said Father Eustace, “we must walk warily--we must not, for example, bring this man--this Sir Piercie Shafton, to our house of Saint Mary&#39;s.” “But how then shall we dispose of him?” replied the Abbot; “bethink thee that he is a sufferer for holy Church&#39;s sake--that his patron, the Earl of Northumberland, hath been our friend, and that, lying so near us, he may work us weal or wo according as we deal with his kinsman.” “And, accordingly,” said the Sub-Prior, “for these reasons, as well as for discharge of the great duty of Christian charity, I would protect and relieve this man.
We will make such means for his convenience as we can devise.” “Will he be persuaded, thinkest thou?” said the Abbot; “I will leave my own travelling bed for his repose, and send up a suitable easy-chair.” “With such easements,” said the Sub-Prior, “he must not complain; and then, if threatened by any sudden danger, he can soon come down to the sanctuary, where we will harbour him in secret until means can be devised of dismissing him in safety.” “Were we not better,” said the Abbot, “send him on to the court, and get rid of him at once?” “Ay, but at the expense of our friends--this butterfly may fold his wings, and lie under cover in the cold air of Glendearg; but were he at Holyrood, he would, did his life depend on it, expand his spangled drapery in the eyes of the queen and court--Rather than fail of distinction, he would sue for love to our gracious sovereign--the eyes of all men would be upon him in the course of three short days, and the international peace of the two ends of the island endangered for a creature, who, like a silly moth, cannot abstain from fluttering round a light.” “Thou hast prevailed with me, Father Eustace,” said the Abbot, “and it will go hard but I improve on thy plan--I will send up in secret, not only household stuff, but wine and wassell-bread.
Were it not better sleep and wake no more, than to undergo this dull exchange of labour for insensibility and of insensibility for labour?” “God help me,” answered Martin, “there may be truth in what thou sayest--but walk slower, for my old limbs cannot keep pace with your young legs--walk slower, and I will tell you why age, though unlovely, is yet endurable.” “Speak on then,” said Halbert, slackening his pace, “but remember we must seek venison to refresh the fatigues of these holy men, who will this morning have achieved a journey of ten miles; and if we reach not the Brocksburn head we are scarce like to see an antler.” “Then know, my good Halbert,” said Martin, “whom I love as my own son, that I am satisfied to live till death calls me, because my Maker wills it.
“Surely,” answered Martin, “in some sort I can; for I have travelled through court, and camp, and city, with my master, Walter Avenel, although he could do nothing for me in the long run, but give me room for two score of sheep on the hill--and surely even now, while I speak with you, I feel sensible that my language is more refined than it is my wont to use, and that--though I know not the reason--the rude northern dialect, so familiar to my tongue, has given place to a more town-bred speech.” “And this change in thyself and me, thou canst by no means account for?” said young Glendinning.
I have heard, forby, that Hughie Dun left a good five hundred punds of Scots money to his only daughter, and that she married the Bailie of Pittenweem.” At this moment, and while Halbert was embarrassed with devising a suitable answer, a deer bounded across their path.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>My heart is hardened against fear, as by a sense of despair.
for thee it is well, Here calling me in haunted dell, That thy heart has not quail&#39;d, Nor thy courage fail&#39;d, And that thou couldst brook The angry look Of Her of Avenel.
Chanceful in shape, yet mightiest still, He wields the heart of man at will, From ill to good, from good, to ill, In cot and castle-tower.” “Speak not thus darkly,” said the youth, colouring so deeply, that face, neck, and hands were in a sanguine glow; “make me sensible of thy purpose.” The spirit answered,-- “Ask thy heart,--whose secret cell Is fill&#39;d with Marv Avenel!
Ask thy heart, and it shall tell, Sighing from its secret cell, &#39;Tis for Mary Avenel.” “Tell me, then,” said Halbert, his cheek still deeply crimsoned, “thou who hast said to me that which I dared not say to myself, by what means shall I urge my passion--by what means make it known?” The White Lady replied,-- “Do not ask me; On doubts like these thou canst not task me.
We, who soar thy sphere above, Know not aught of hate or love; As will or wisdom rules thy mood, My gifts to evil turn, or good.” “Give me to redeem my honour,” said Halbert Glendinning--“give me to retort on my proud rival the insults he has thrown on me, and let the rest fare as it will.
The smoking haunch now stood upon the table; a napkin, white as snow, was, with due reverence, tucked under the chin of the Abbot by the Refectioner; and nought was wanting to commence the repast, save the presence of Sir Piercie Shafton, who at length appeared, glittering like the sun, in a carnation-velvet doublet, slashed and puffed out with cloth of silver, his hat of the newest block, surrounded by a hatband of goldsmith&#39;s work, while around his neck he wore a collar of gold, set with rubies and topazes so rich, that it vindicated his anxiety for the safety of his baggage from being founded upon his love of mere finery.
Certes, had that goodly chain been visible in some part of your late progress, there was risk that the lawful owner might have parted company therewith.” “This chain, said your reverence?” answered Sir Piercie; “surely it is but a toy, a trifle, a slight thing which shows but poorly with this doublet--marry, when I wear that of the murrey-coloured double-piled Genoa velvet, puffed out with ciprus, the gems, being relieved and set off by the darker and more grave ground of the stuff, show like stars giving a lustre through dark clouds.” “I nothing doubt it,” said the Abbot, “but I pray you to sit down at the board.” But Sir Piercie had now got into his element, and was not easily interrupted--“I own,” he continued, “that slight as the toy is, it might perchance have had some captivation for Julian--Santa Maria!” said he, interrupting himself; “what was I about to say, and my fair and beauteous Protection, or shall I rather term her my Discretion, here in presence!--Indiscreet hath it been in your Affability, O most lovely Discretion, to suffer a stray word to have broke out of the penfold of his mouth, that might overleap the fence of civility, and trespass on the manor of decorum.” “Marry!” said the Abbot, somewhat impatiently, “the greatest discretion that I can see in the matter is, to eat our victuals being hot--Father Eustace, say the Benedicite, and cut up the haunch.” The Sub-Prior readily obeyed the first part of the Abbot&#39;s injunction, but paused upon the second--“It is Friday, most reverend,” he said in Latin, desirous that the hint should escape, if possible, the ears of the stranger.
It has cloven the very heart of the buck.” “What speak you to us of one good shot, father?” said Sir Piercie; “I would advise you that such no more maketh a shooter, than doth one swallow make a summer--I have seen this springald of whom you speak, and if his hand can send forth his shafts as boldly as his tongue doth utter presumptuous speeches, I will own him as good an archer as Robin Hood.” “Marry,” said the Abbot, “and it is fitting we know the truth of this matter from the dame herself; for ill advised were we to give way to any rashness in this matter, whereby the bounties which Heaven and our patroness provide might be unskilfully mangled, and rendered unfit for worthy men&#39;s use.--Stand forth, therefore, dame Glendinning, and tell to us, as thy liege lord and spiritual Superior, using plainness and truth, without either fear or favour, as being a matter wherein we are deeply interested, Doth this son of thine use his bow as well as the Father Kitchener avers to us?” “So please your noble fatherhood,” answered Dame Glendinning with a deep curtsy, “I should know somewhat of archery to my cost, seeing my husband--God assoilzie him!--was slain in the field of Pinkie with an arrow-shot, while he was fighting under the Kirk&#39;s banner, as became a liege vassal of the Halidome.
He was a valiant man, please your reverence, and an honest; and saving that he loved a bit of venison, and shifted for his living at a time as Border-men will sometimes do, I wot not of sin that he did.
my reverend lord,” replied the widow, “and my croft would be better tilled, if I could answer your reverence that he is not.--Practised archer!--marry, holy sir, I would he would practise something else--cross-bow and long-bow, hand-gun and hack-but, falconet and saker, he can shoot with them all.
Therefore will we try no perilous experiments.” “Be that as you will, Sir Piercie,” said the Abbot; “meantime we will name this youth bow-bearer in the forest granted to us by good King David, that the chase might recreate our wearied spirits, the flesh of the dear improve our poor commons, and the hides cover the books of our library; thus tending at once to the sustenance of body and soul.” “Kneel down, woman, kneel down,” said the Refectioner and the Kitchener, with one voice, to Dame Glendinning, “and kiss his lordship&#39;s hand, for the grace which he has granted to thy son.” They then, as if they had been chanting the service and the responses, set off in a sort of duetto, enumerating the advantages of the situation.
Dame Glendinning was all this while on her knees, her head mechanically turning from the one church officer to the other, which, as they stood one on each side of her, had much the appearance of a figure moved by clock-work, and so soon as they were silent, most devotedly did she kiss the munificent hand of the Abbot.
Nevertheless, he is a youth of no common spirit, but much like those (in my weak judgment) whom God raises up among a people when he meaneth that their deliverance shall be wrought out with strength of hand and valour of heart.
Such men we have seen marked with a waywardness, and even an obstinacy of character, which hath appeared intractability and stupidity to those among whom they walked and were conversant, until the very opportunity hath arrived in, which it was the will of Providence that they should be the fitting instrument of great things.” “Now, in good time hast thou spoken, Father Eustace,” said the Abbot; “and we will see this swankie before we decide upon the means of employing him.--How say you, Sir Piercie Shafton, is it not the court fashion to suit the man to the office, and not the office to the man?” “So please your reverence and lordship,” answered the Northumbrian knight, “I do partly, that is, in some sort, subscribe to what your wisdom hath delivered--Nevertheless, under reverence of the Sub-Prior, we do not look for gallant leaders and national deliverers in the hovels of the mean common people.
He kneeled and kissed the Abbot&#39;s hand, then rose, and retiring two paces, bowed respectfully to the circle around, smiling gently as he received an encouraging nod from the Sub-Prior, to whom alone he was personally known, and blushing as he encountered the anxious look of Mary Avenel, who beheld with painful interest the sort of ordeal to which her foster-brother was about to be subjected.
The conduct of his brother Edward, for a lad constitutionally shy, respectful, and even timid, was at once affectionate and noble.
Having benevolently intimated a boon to his faithful followers, which he probably judged would be far from unacceptable, the good Abbot, seeing all ready for his journey, bestowed his blessing on the assembled household--gave his hand to be kissed by Dame Glendinning--himself kissed the cheek of Mary Avenel, and even of the Miller&#39;s maiden, when they approached to render him the same homage--commanded Halbert to rule his temper, and to be aiding and obedient in all things to the English Knight--admonished Edward to be _discipulus impiger atque strenuus_--then took a courteous farewell of Sir Piercie Shafton, advising him to lie close, for fear of the English borderers, who might be employed to kidnap him; and having discharged these various offices of courtesy, moved forth to the courtyard, followed by the whole establishment.
When the Sub-Prior had mounted to accompany his principal, his eye sought out Halbert, who, partly hidden by a projection of the outward wall of the court, stood apart from, and gazing upon the departing cavalcade, and the group which assembled around them.
The look and sign of warning which the Sub-Prior gave to Halbert Glendinning as they parted, went to his heart; for although he had profited much less than Edward by the good man&#39;s instructions, he had a sincere reverence for his person; and even the short time he had for deliberation tended to show him he was embarked in a perilous adventure.
But though his heart might beat somewhat thicker, he was too high-spirited to exhibit any external signs of emotion.--“What is your pleasure, Sir Piercie?” he said to the English knight, enduring without apparent discomposure all the terrors which his antagonist had summoned into his aspect.
“What is my pleasure!” answered Sir Piercie; “a goodly question after the part you have acted towards me!--Young man, I know not what infatuation has led thee to place thyself in direct and insolent opposition to one who is a guest of thy liege-lord the Abbot, and who, even from the courtesy due to thy mother&#39;s roof, had a right to remain there without meeting insult.
And though I wot well how much the lovely and quaint language will suffer by my widowed voice, widowed in that it is no longer matched by my beloved viol-de-gamba, I will essay to give you a taste of the ravishing sweetness of the poesy of the un-to-be-imitated Astrophel.” So saying, he sung without mercy or remorse about five hundred verses, of which the two first and the four last may suffice for a specimen-- “What tongue can her perfections tell, On whose each part all pens may dwell.
“If I tell a tale so wonderful,” thought he, “shall I not either be stigmatized as a liar, or punished as a wizard?--Were Sir Piercie Shafton generous, noble, and benevolent, as the champions of whom we hear in romance, I might indeed gain his ear, and, without demeaning myself, escape from the situation in which I am placed.
He remained, therefore, in mere terror, gazing on the apparition, which chanted or recited in cadence the following lines-- “He whose heart for vengeance sued, Must not shrink from shedding blood The knot that thou hast tied with word, Thou must loose by edge of sword.” “Avaunt thee, false Spirit!” said Halbert Glendinning; “I have bought thy advice too dearly already--Begone in the name of God!” The Spirit laughed; and the cold unnatural sound of her laughter had something in it more fearful than the usually melancholy tones of her voice.
You meditate not the destruction of the deer--your hand and your heart are aimed at other game--you seek to do battle with this stranger.” “And wherefore should I quarrel with our guest?” answered Halbert, blushing deeply.
“There are, indeed, many reasons why you should not,” replied the maiden, “nor is there one of avail wherefore you should--yet nevertheless, such a quarrel you are now searching after.” “Why should you suppose so, Mary?” said Halbert, endeavouring to hide his conscious purpose--“he is my mother&#39;s guest--he is protected by the Abbot and the community, who are our masters--he is of high degree also,--and wherefore should you think that I can, or dare, resent a hasty word, which he has perchance thrown out against me more from the wantonness of his wit, than the purpose of his heart?” “Alas!” answered the maiden, “the very asking that question puts your resolution beyond a doubt.
He would not have heard his mother, would not have heard his adopted sister, beseech him in vain not to ruin himself, and tear up their future hopes of happiness and protection.” Halbert&#39;s heart swelled as he replied to this reproach.
For what fate has given me such a power I know not; but bred an ignorant maiden, in this sequestered valley, mine eyes can too often see what man would most willingly hide--I can judge of the dark purpose, though it is hid under the smiling brow, and a glance of the eye says more to me than oaths and protestations do to others.” “Then,” said Halbert, “if thou canst so read the human heart,--say, dear Mary--what dost thou see in mine?--tell me that--say that what thou seest--what thou readest in this bosom, does not offend thee--say but _that_, and thou shalt be the guide of my actions, and mould me now and henceforward to honour or to dishonour at thy own free will!” Mary Avenel became first red, and then deadly pale, as Halbert Glendinning spoke.
But when, turning round at the close of his address, he took her hand, she gently withdrew it, and replied, “I cannot read the heart, Halbert, and I would not of my will know aught of yours, save what beseems us both--I only can judge of signs, words, and actions of little outward import, more truly than those around me, as my eyes, thou knowest, have seen objects not presented to those of others.” “Let them gaze then on one whom they shall never see more,” said Halbert, once more turning from her, and rushing out of the court-yard without again looking back.
a speech, which the proudest beauty at the court of Felicia (so let me call the Elysium from which I am banished!)
As, therefore, he went forth, in his own idea, in all love and honour towards his antagonist, he saw not any cause for submitting longer to the painful restraint of positive silence.
And I doubt nothing,” he added, “that you have availed yourself of some opportunity to improve yourself in the art of fence, which is more akin than dancing to our present purpose?” “I know nothing more of fencing,” said Halbert, “than hath been taught me by an old shepherd of ours, called Martin, and at whiles a lesson from Christie of the Clinthill--for the rest, I must trust to good sword, strong arm, and sound heart.” “Marry and I am glad of it, young Audacity, (I will call you my Audacity, and you will call me your Condescension, while we are on these terms of unnatural equality,) I am glad of your ignorance with all my heart.
Their vicinity to the favourite haunt of the White Lady led him to form conjectures concerning the incident of the grave--“It must have been her work!” he thought: “the Spirit foresaw and has provided for the fatal event of the combat--I must return from this place a homicide, or I must remain here for ever!” The bridge seemed now broken down behind him, and the chance of coming off honourably without killing or being killed, (the hope of which issue has cheered the sinking heart of many a duellist,) seemed now altogether to be removed.
All the beauties of Felicia (by which name I distinguish our beloved England) stood in the gallery, waving their kerchiefs at each turn of the game, and cheering the winners by their plaudits.
Whereupon, looking upon me somewhat scornfully, yet not so but what the experienced courtier might perceive a certain cast of approbative affection----” Here the knight was interrupted by Halbert, who had waited with courteous patience for some little time, till he found, that far from drawing to a close, Sir Piercie seemed rather inclined to wax prolix in his reminiscences.
You should have abidden in England had you desired to waste time in words, for here we spend it in blows.” “I crave your pardon, most rusticated Audacity,” answered Sir Piercie; “truly I become oblivious of every thing beside, when the recollections of the divine court of Felicia press upon my wakened memory, even as a saint is dazzled when he bethinks him of the beatific vision.
delicate nurse of the fair, chosen abode of the wise, the birth-place and cradle of nobility, the temple of courtesy, the fane of sprightly chivalry--Ah, heavenly court, or rather courtly heaven!
Yes, life hath left him--every busy thought, Each fiery passion, every strong affection, All sense of outward ill and inward sorrow, Are fled at once from the pale trunk before me; And I have given that which spoke and moved, Thought, acted, suffer&#39;d as a living man, To be a ghastly form of bloody clay, Soon the foul food for reptiles.
“I trust you shall yet do well--Oh for a leech!” “Were there twenty physicians, O most generous Audacity, and that were a grave spectacle--I might not survive, my life is ebbing fast.--Commend me to the rustical nymph whom I called my Discretion--O Claridiana!--true empress of this bleeding heart--which now bleedeth in sad earnest!--Place me on the ground at my length, most rustical victor, born to quench the pride of the burning light of the most felicitous court of Feliciana--O saints and angels---knights and ladies--masques and theatres--quaint devices--chain-work and broidery--love, honour, and beauty!----” While muttering these last words, which slid from him, as it were unawares, while doubtless he was calling to mind the glories of the English court, the gallant Sir Piercie Shafton stretched out his limbs--groaned deeply, shut his eyes, and became motionless.
His heart sank within him.
They fell far short certainly of those which might have afflicted a mind regulated by better religious precepts, and more strictly trained under social laws; but still they were deep and severely felt, and divided in Halbert&#39;s heart even the regret with which he parted from Mary Avenel and the tower of his fathers.
My heart now tells me I have done evil--it were harder than these rocks if it could bear unmoved the thought, that I have sent this man to a long account, unhousled and unshrieved.” “Pause there, my son,” said the traveller.
Art thou he, and darest thou to approach the Halidome of Saint Mary&#39;s?” “I am Henry Warden, of a surety,” said the old man, “far unworthy to be named in the same breath with Knox, but yet willing to venture on whatever dangers my master&#39;s service may call me to.” “Hearken to me, then,” said Halbert; “to slay thee, I have no heart--to make thee prisoner, were equally to bring thy blood on my head--to leave thee in this wild without a guide, were little better.
I will conduct thee, as I promised, in safety to the Castle of Avenel; but breathe not, while we are on the journey, a word against the doctrines of the holy church of which I am an unworthy--but though an ignorant, a zealous member.--When thou art there arrived, beware of thyself--there is a high price upon thy head, and Julian Avenel loves the glance of gold bonnet-pieces.” [Footnote: A gold coin of James V., the most beautiful of the Scottish series; so called because the effigy of the sovereignty is represented wearing a bonnet.]
The surprise of the spectator was chiefly excited by finding a piece of water situated in that high and mountainous region, and the landscape around had features which might rather be termed wild, than either romantic or sublime; yet the scene was not without its charms.
But in Vetholm Loch, (a romantic sheet of water, in the dry march, as it is called,) there are the remains of a fortress called Lochside Tower, which, like the supposed Castle of Avenel, is built upon an island, and connected with the land by a causeway.
I&#39;ll walk on tiptoe; arm my eye with caution, My heart with courage, and my hand with weapon, Like him who ventures on a lion&#39;s den.
“But it was not so,” answered Glendinning; “yonder castle was built by the old lords of Avenel, men as much beloved in peace as they were respected in war.
The present usurper of their inheritance no more resembles them, than the night-prowling owl resembles a falcon, because she builds on the same rock.” “This Julian Avenel, then, holds no high place in the love and regard of his neighbours?” said Warden.
For myself, I intend to go to Edinburgh to see the court and the Queen, and when I return hither we will talk of your proffer.
He seemed in deep and moody reflection, and was pacing at a distance from his dependents along the upper end of the hall, sometimes stopping from time to time to caress and feed a gos-hawk, which sat upon his wrist, with its jesses (_i.
But then the lowly seat,--the expression of deep melancholy, which was changed into a timid smile whenever she saw the least chance of catching the eye of Julian Avenel,--the subdued look of grief, and the starting tear for which that constrained smile was again exchanged when she saw herself entirely disregarded,--these were not the attributes of a wife, or they were those of a dejected and afflicted female, who had yielded her love on less than legitimate terms.
Julian Avenel, as we have said, continued to pace the hall without paying any of that mute attention which is rendered to almost every female either by affection or courtesy.
Remember thou speakest to one somewhat short of patience, who loves a short health and a long draught.” “In a word, then,” said Henry Warden, “that lady--” “How?” said the Baron, starting--“what of her?--what hast thou to say of that dame?” “Is she thy house-dame?” said the preacher, after a moment&#39;s pause, in which, he seemed to seek for the best mode of expressing what he had to say--“Is she, in brief, thy wife?” The unfortunate young woman pressed both her hands on her face, as if to hide it, but the deep blush which crimsoned her brow and neck, showed that her cheeks were also glowing; and the bursting tears, which found their way betwixt her slender fingers, bore witness to her sorrow, as well as to her shame.
When we are handfasted, as we term it, we are man and wife for a year and day--that space gone by, each may choose another mate, or, at their pleasure, may call the priest to marry them for life--and this we call handfasting.” [Footnote: This custom of handfasting actually prevailed in the upland days.
While the convents subsisted, monks were detached on regular circuits through the wilder districts, to marry those who had lived in this species of connexion.
“Then,” said the preacher, “I tell thee, noble Baron, in brotherly love to thy soul, it is a custom licentious, gross, and corrupted, and, if persisted in, dangerous, yea, damnable.
It binds thee to the frailer being while she is the object of desire--it relieves thee when she is most the subject of pity--it gives all to brutal sense, and nothing to generous and gentle affection.
He can indeed give them both the rank, the state of married wife and of lawful son; but, in public opinion, their names will be smirched and sullied with a stain which his tardy efforts cannot entirely efface.
Mony a sair heart have the Piercies given to Scots wife and bairns with their pricking on the Borders.
The scene of the preceding day had dwelt on the mind of Father Eustace, who was of that keen and penetrating cast of mind which loves not to leave unascertained whatever of mysterious is subjected to its inquiry.
Snatching her from Martin&#39;s arms with the eagerness of affectionate terror, Edward bore her to the casement, that she might receive the influence of the open air; the Sub-Prior, who, like many of his profession, had some knowledge of medicine, hastened to prescribe the readiest remedies which occurred to him, and the terrified females contended with, and impeded each other, in their rival efforts to be useful.
What cause hath moved the ruby current of life to rush back to the citadel of the heart, leaving pale those features in which it should have delighted to meander for ever?--Let me approach her,” he said,”--with this sovereign essence, distilled by the fair hands of the divine Urania, and powerful to recall fugitive life, even if it were trembling on the verge of departure.” Thus speaking, Sir Piercie Shafton knelt down, and most gracefully presented to the nostrils of Mary Avenel a silver pouncet-box, exquisitely chased, containing a sponge dipt in the essence which he recommmended so highly.
Little good comes of a Piercie&#39;s hunting, from Chevy Chase till now.” “Be silent, woman,” said the Sub-Prior, “and rail not upon the English knight; we do not yet know of any thing beyond suspicion.” “We will have his heart&#39;s blood!” said Dame Glendinning; and, seconded by the faithful Tibbie, she made such a sudden onslaught on the unlucky Euphuist, as must have terminated in something serious, had not the monk, aided by Mysie Happer, interposed to protect him from their fury.
Let me pray you to say whether the grave, which has been seen at your place of combat, was open or closed when your encounter took place?” “Reverend father,” said the knight, “I will veil from you nothing, but show you each secret of my bosom; even as the pure fountain revealeth the smallest pebble which graces the sand at the bottom of its crystal mirror, and as--” “Speak in plain terms, for the love of heaven!” said the monk; “these holiday phrases belong not to solemn affairs--Was the grave open when the conflict began?” “It was,” answered the knight, “I acknowledge it; even as he that acknowledgeth--” “Nay, I pray you, fair son, forbear these similitudes, and observe me.
Since I entered into this northern land, in which men say that sorceries do abound, I, who am held in awe and regard even by the prime gallants in the court of Feliciana, have been here bearded and taunted by a clod-treading clown.
Reverend sir, it is not to your ears that men should tell tales of love and gallantry, nor is Sir Piercie Shafton one who, to any ears whatsoever, is wont to boast of his fair acceptance with the choice and prime beauties of the court; insomuch that a lady, none of the least resplendent constellations which revolve in that hemisphere of honour, pleasure, and beauty, but whose name I here pretermit, was wont to call me her Taciturnity.
Nevertheless truth must be spoken; and I cannot but allow, as the general report of the court, allowed in camps, and echoed back by city and country, that in the alacrity of the accost, the tender delicacy of the regard, the facetiousness of the address, the adopting and pursuing of the fancy, the solemn close and the graceful fall-off, Piercie Shafton was accounted the only gallant of the time, and so well accepted among the choicer beauties of the age, that no silk-hosed reveller of the presence-chamber, or plumed jouster of the tilt-yard, approached him by a bow&#39;s length in the ladies&#39; regard, being the mark at which every well-born and generous juvenal aimeth his shaft.
Nay, this very day, while I was in the act of kneeling at her feet to render her the succours of this pungent quintessence, of purest spirit distilled by the fairest hands of the court of Feliciana, she pushed me from her with looks which savoured of repugnance, and, as I think, thrust at me with her foot as if to spurn me from her presence.
will you, for the imagined death of a rude, low-born frampler and wrangler, venture to impinge upon the liberty of the kinsman of the house of Piercie?” “Sir Knight,” returned the Sub-Prior, civilly, “your high lineage and your kindling anger will avail you nothing in this matter--You shall not come here to seek a shelter, and then spill our blood as if it were water.” “I tell you,” said the knight, “once more, as I have told you already, that there was no blood spilled but mine own!” “That remains to be proved,” replied the Sub-Prior; “we of the community of Saint Mary&#39;s of Kennaquhair, use not to take fairy tales in exchange for the lives of our liege vassals.” “We of the house of Piercie,” answered Shafton, “brook neither threats nor restraint--I say I will travel to-morrow, happen what may!” “And I,” answered the Sub-Prior, in the same tone of determination, “say that I will break your journey, come what may!” “Who shall gainsay me,” said the knight, “if I make my way by force?” “You will judge wisely to think ere you make such an attempt,” answered the monk, with composure; “there are men enough in the Halidome to vindicate its rights over those who dare infringe them.” “My cousin of Northumberland will know how to revenge this usage to a beloved kinsman so near to his blood,” said the Englishman.
You know that my hand grasped more readily to the book than to the sword; and that I lacked utterly the ready and bold spirit which distinguished----” Here his voice faltered, and he paused for a moment, and then went on with resolution and rapidity--“I would say, that I was unequal to Halbert in promptitude of heart and of hand; but Halbert is gone, and I stand his representative, and that of my father--his successor in all his rights,” (while he said this his eyes shot fire,) “and bound to assert and maintain them as he would have done--therefore I am a changed man, increased in courage as in my rights and pretensions.
But mark me, father, if they shall fail in rendering me that justice, I bear a heart and a hand which, though I love not such extremities, are capable of remedying such an error.
[Footnote: Sir Piercie Shafton&#39;s extreme love of dress was an attribute of the coxcombs of this period.
Ride after him, and, lighting at the court gate both together, embraced, and marched hand in hand up into the presence.
It was not cast away, but received with a devout sense of his condescension, and with gratitude for his personal notice, which, joined to her fears for his safety, and the natural tenderness of her disposition, began to make wild work in her heart.
And then Halbert&#39;s dress was as clownish as his manners were haughty; and this poor young gentleman, (who was habited like any prince,) banished from his own land, was first drawn into a quarrel by a rude brangler, and then persecuted and like to be put to death by his kin and allies.” Mysie wept bitterly at the thought, and then her heart rising against such cruelty and oppression to a defenceless stranger, who dressed with so much skill, and spoke with so much grace, she began to consider whether she could not render him some assistance in this extremity.
She was of a simple and affectionate, but at the same time an alert and enterprising character, possessing more than female strength of body, and more than female courage, though with feelings as capable of being bewildered with gallantry of dress and language, as a fine gentleman of any generation would have desired to exercise his talents upon.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Love and generous compassion, which give singly such powerful impulse to the female heart, were in this case united, and championed her to the last extremity of hazard.
With a trembling step and throbbing heart, she undid the door which separated her from the apartment in which the Southron knight was confined, and almost flinched from her fixed purpose, when she found herself in the same room with the sleeping prisoner.
She placed her fingers on her lips, in token that he must observe the most strict silence, and then pointed to the door to intimate that it was watched.
The romantic imagination of the gallant would soon have coined some compliment proper for the occasion, but Mysie left him not time.
Edward Glendinning hath sent for Dan of the Howlet-hirst, and young Adie of Aikenshaw, and they are come with three men more, and with bow, and jack, and spear, and I heard them say to each other, and to Edward, as they alighted in the court, that they would have amends for the death of their kinsman, if the monk&#39;s cowl should smoke for it--And the vassals are so wilful now, that the Abbot himself dare not control them, for fear they turn heretics, and refuse to pay their feu-duties.” “In faith,” said Sir Piercie Shafton, “it may be a shrewd temptation, and perchance the monks may rid themselves of trouble and cumber, by handing me over the march to Sir John Foster or Lord Hundson, the English wardens, and so make peace with their vassals and with England at once.
menseful Mysie of the Mill so soon at her prayers?--now, benison on the bonny eyes that open so early!--I&#39;ll have a kiss for good morrow&#39;s sake.” Dan of the Howlet-hirst, for he was the gallant who paid Mysie this compliment, suited the action with the word, and the action, as is usual in such cases of rustic gallantry, was rewarded with a cuff, which Dan received as a fine gentleman receives a tap with a fan, but which, delivered by the energetic arm of the Miller&#39;s maiden, would have certainly astonished a less robust gallant.
“How now, Sir Coxcomb!” said she, “and must you be away from your guard over the English knight, to plague quiet folks with your horse-tricks!” “Truly you are mistaken, pretty Mysie,” said the clown, “for I have not yet relieved Edward at his post; and were it not a shame to let him stay any longer, by my faith, I could find it in my heart not to quit you these two hours.” “Oh, you have hours and hours enough to see any one,” said Mysie; “but you must think of the distress of the household even now, and get Edward to sleep for a while, for he has kept watch this whole night.” “I will have another kiss first,” answered Dan of the Howlet-hirst.
She dried her tears; and when the knight, in all kind and chivalrous courtesy, stooped to embrace her at their parting, she rose humbly up to receive the proffered honour in a posture of more deference, and meekly and gratefully accepted the offered salute.
The companion of Astrophel, and flower of the tilt-yard of Feliciana, had no more idea that his graces and good parts could attach the love of Mysie Happer, than a first-rate beauty in the boxes dreams of the fatal wound which her charms may inflict on some attorney&#39;s romantic apprentice in the pit.
I suppose, in any ordinary case, the pride of rank and distinction would have pronounced on the humble admirer the doom which Beau Fielding denounced against the whole female world, “Let them look and die;” but the obligations under which he lay to the enamoured maiden, miller&#39;s daughter as she was, precluded the possibility of Sir Piercie&#39;s treating the matter _en cavalier_, and, much embarrassed, yet a little flattered at the same time, he rode back to try what could be done for the damsel&#39;s relief.
She was betrayed by the sparkle of the rekindling eye, and a caress which, however timidly bestowed, she could not help giving to the neck of the horse which brought back the beloved rider.
They journeyed on, therefore, in tolerable security, and Sir Piercie Shafton found leisure to amuse the time in high-flown speeches and long anecdotes of the court of Feliciana, to which Mysie bent an ear not a whit less attentive, that she did not understand one word out of three which was uttered by her fellow-traveller.
She explained to the publican that this was a great English knight travelling from the Monastery to the court of Scotland, after having paid his vows to Saint Mary, and that she had been directed to conduct him so far on the road; and that Ball, her palfrey, had fallen by the way, because he had been over-wrought with carrying home the last melder of meal to the portioner of Langhope; and that she had turned in Ball to graze in the Tasker&#39;s park, near Cripplecross, for he had stood as still as Lot&#39;s wife with very weariness; and that the knight had courteously insisted she should ride behind him, and that she had brought him to her kend friend&#39;s hostelry rather than to proud Peter Peddie&#39;s, who got his malt at the Mellerstane mills; and that he must get the best that the house afforded, and that he must get it ready in a moment of time, and that she was ready to help in the kitchen.
Yet this jarring feeling was mixed with, and perhaps balanced by, the extreme grace with which the neat-handed maiden executed these tasks, however mean in themselves, and gave to the wretched corner of a miserable inn of the period, the air of a bower, in which an enamoured fairy, or at least a shepherdess of Arcadia, was displaying, with unavailing solicitude, her designs on the heart of some knight, destined by fortune to higher thoughts, and a more splendid union.
In fine, the affectionate delicacy of her whole demeanour, joined to the promptitude and boldness she had so lately evinced, tended to ennoble the services she had rendered, as if some -----sweet engaging Grace Put on some clothes to come abroad, And took a waiter&#39;s place.
But, on the other hand, came the damning reflection, that these duties were not taught her by Love, to serve the beloved only, but arose from the ordinary and natural habits of a miller&#39;s daughter, accustomed, doubtless, to render the same service to every wealthier churl who frequented her father&#39;s mill.
This stopped the mouth of vanity, and of the love which vanity had been hatching, as effectually as a peck of literal flour would have done.
On the other hand, he was a man, and foresaw various circumstances which might render their journey together in this intimate fashion a scandal and a snare.
The knight paced slowly to horse, partook of his courtesy, and thanked him with the stiff condescension of the court of Elizabeth; then mounted and followed the northern path, which was pointed out as the nearest to Edinburgh, and which, though very unlike a modern highway, bore yet so distinct a resemblance to a public and frequented road as not to be easily mistaken.
The matter of his discourse, though adorned with many unnecessary flourishes, was honourable both to his head and heart.
Sir Piercie Shafton, whose head never kept very long in any continued train of thinking, acquiesced without much reply, resolving in his own mind that the maiden only used this apology to disguise her real motive, of affection to his person.
The romance of the situation flattered his vanity and elevated his imagination, as placing him in the situation of one of those romantic heroes of whom he had read the histories, where similar transformations made a distinguished figure.
“You cannot but remember the cause which has brought me here,” she continued; “make the least approach to any familiarity which you would not offer to a princess surrounded by her court, and you have seen the last of the Miller&#39;s daughter--She will vanish as the chaff disappears from the shieling-hill [Footnote: The place where corn was winnowed, while that operation was performed by the hand, was called in Scotland the Shieling-hill.]
Had she but read Euphues, and forgotten that accursed mill and shieling-hill, it is my thought that her converse would be broidered with as many and as choice pearls of compliment, as that of the most rhetorical lady in the court of Feliciana.
She felt as those who, loving for the first time, have lost what they loved, before time and repeated calamity have taught them that every loss is to a certain extent reparable or endurable.
The grave--and it was a bloody grave--had closed, as she believed, over the youth to whom she was secretly, but most warmly attached; the force and ardour of Halbert&#39;s character bearing a singular correspondence to the energy of which her own was capable.
She respected the more gentle character, and more peaceful attainments, of the younger Glendinning; but it had not escaped her (what never indeed escaped woman in such circumstances) that he was disposed to place himself in competition with what she, the daughter of a proud and warlike race, deemed the more manly qualities of his elder brother; and there is no time when a woman does so little justice to the character of a surviving lover, as when comparing him with the preferred rival of whom she has been recently deprived.
They easily succeeded in alarming the inhabitants of the cottages beyond the precincts of the court; but the men had been called in to strengthen the guard for the night, and only women and children remained who could contribute nothing in the emergency, except their useless exclamations of surprise, and there were no neighbours for miles around.
But the affectionate mother had made preparations for the earthly work which she had most at heart.
Among these was one frequently used, as it seemed from the state of the manuscript, on which the mother of Mary had transcribed and placed together those affecting texts to which the heart has recourse, in affliction, and which assures us at once of the sympathy and protection afforded to the children of the promise.
She read the affecting promise, “I will never leave thee nor forsake thee,” and the consoling exhortation, “Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee.” She read them, and her heart acquiesced in the conclusion.
Not all this din, combined in hideous concert, and expressive of aught but peace, love, and forgiveness, could divert Mary Avenel from the new course of study on which she had so singularly entered.
A heart, naturally kind and noble, was, in this instance, as it has been in many more, deceived by its own generosity.
To the honour more of Father Eustace&#39;s heart than of his consistency, the communication that Henry Warden was placed within his power, struck him with more sorrow than triumph; but his next feelings were those of exultation.
They had been ancient and intimate friends in youth at a foreign university, but had been long separated from each other; and the change of name, which the preacher had adopted from motives of safety, and the monk from the common custom of the convent, had prevented the possibility of their hitherto recognizing each other in the opposite parts which they had been playing in the great polemical and political drama.
When his hands were at liberty, however, he showed his sense of the kindness by again exchanging a grasp and a look of affection with the Sub-Prior.
“And is this, then, the end of that restless activity of mind, that bold and indefatigable love of truth that urged investigation to its utmost limits, and seemed to take heaven itself by storm--is this the termination of Wellwood&#39;s career?--And having known and loved him during the best years of our youth, do we meet in our old age as judge and criminal?” “Not as judge and criminal,” said Henry Warden,--for to avoid confusion we describe him by his later and best known name--“Not as judge and criminal do we meet, but as a misguided oppressor and his ready and devoted victim.
May God so judge me,” said the Reformer, “as I would buy the conversion of a soul like thine with my dearest heart&#39;s blood.” “To thee, and with better reason, do I return the wish,” replied the Sub-Prior; “it is such an arm as thine that should defend the bulwarks of the Church, and it is now directing the battering-ram against them, and rendering practicable the breach through which all that is greedy, and all that is base, and all that is mutable and hot-headed in this innovating age, already hope to advance to destruction and to spoil.
But the poet you have quoted affords strains fitter for a dissolute court than for a convent.” “I might retort on your Theodore Beza,” said the Sub-Prior, smiling; “but I hate the judgment that, like the flesh-fly, skims over whatever is sound, to detect and settle upon some spot which is tainted.
and such is the sure trust which I repose in thy good faith, that thou shalt remain here unharmed and unsecured, a prisoner at large, subject only to appear before our court when called upon.” The preacher paused--“I am unwilling,” he said, “to fetter my native liberty by any self-adopted engagement.
The heart of the Sub-Prior (bigoted as he was) relented, and he doubted if he ought to purchase, by a rigorous discharge of what he deemed his duty, the remorse he might afterwards feel for the death of one so nobly independent in thought and character, the friend, besides, of his own happiest years, during which they had, side by side, striven in the noble race of knowledge, and indulged their intervals of repose in the lighter studies of classical and general letters.
Then in my gown of sober gray Along the mountain path I&#39;ll wander, And wind my solitary way To the sad shrine that courts me yonder.
“It is true,” he added, “that the adjacent grass was trampled and bloody.” “These are delusions of the Enemy,” said the Sub-Prior, crossing himself.--“Christian men may no longer doubt of it.” “But an it be so,” said Warden, “Christian men might better guard themselves by the sword of prayer than by the idle form of a cabalistical spell.” “The badge of our salvation,” said the Sub-Prior, “cannot be so termed--the sign of the cross disarmeth all evil spirits.” “Ay,” answered Henry Warden, apt and armed for controversy, “but it should be borne in the heart, not scored with the fingers in the air.
“What canst thou have done to deserve such self-accusation?--Hast thou too listened,” he added, knitting his brows, “to the demon of heresy, ever most effectual tempter of those, who, like yonder unhappy man, are distinguished by their love of knowledge?” “I am guiltless in that matter,” answered Glendinning, “nor have presumed to think otherwise than thou, my kind father, hast taught me, and than the Church allows.” “And what is it then, my son,” said the Sub-Prior, kindly, “which thus afflicts thy conscience?
“My brother Halbert--so kind, so brave, so gentle, who spoke not, thought not, acted not, but in love to me, whose hand had aided me in every difficulty, whose eye watched over me like the eagle&#39;s over her nestlings, when they prove their first flight from the eyry--this brother, so kind, so gently affectionate--I heard of his sudden, his bloody, his violent death, and I rejoiced--I heard of his unexpected restoration, and I sorrowed!” “Edward,” said the father, “thou art beside thyself--what could urge thee to such odious ingratitude?--In your hurry of spirits you have mistaken the confused tenor of your feelings--Go, my son, pray and compose thy mind--we will speak of this another time.” “No, father, no,” said Edward, vehemently, “now or never!--I will find the means to tame this rebellious heart of mine, or I will tear it out of my bosom--Mistake its passions?--No, father, grief can ill be mistaken for joy--All wept, all shrieked around me--my mother--the menials--she too, the cause of my crime--all wept--and I--I could hardly disguise my brutal and insane joy under the appearance of revenge--Brother, I said, I cannot give thee tears, but I will give thee blood--Yes, father, as I counted hour after hour, while I kept watch upon the English prisoner, and said, I am an hour nearer to hope and to happiness----” “I understand thee not, Edward,” said the monk, “nor can I conceive in what way thy brother&#39;s supposed murder should have affected thee with such unnatural joy--Surely the sordid desire to succeed him in his small possessions----” “Perish the paltry trash!” said Edward, with the same emotion.
“No, father, it was rivalry--it was jealous rage--it was the love of Mary Avenel, that rendered me the unnatural wretch I confess myself!” “Of Mary Avenel!” said the Priest--“of a lady so high above either of you in name and in rank?
How dared Halbert--how dared you, to presume to lift your eye to her but in honour and respect, as a superior of another degree from yours?” “When did love wait for the sanction of heraldry?” replied Edward; “and in what but a line of dead ancestors was Mary, our mother&#39;s guest and foster-child, different from us, with whom she was brought up?--Enough, we loved--we both loved her!
I saw that even when I was more approved, Halbert was more beloved.
I bore all this--I saw my rival&#39;s advancing progress in her affections--I bore it, father, and yet I hated him not--I could not hate him!” “And well for thee that thou didst not,” said the father; “wild and headstrong as thou art, wouldst thou hate thy brother for partaking in thine own folly?” “Father,” replied Edward, “the world esteems thee wise, and holds thy knowledge of mankind high; but thy question shows that thou hast never loved.
It was by an effort that I saved myself from hating my kind and affectionate brother, who, all unsuspicious of my rivalry, was perpetually loading me with kindness.
I cannot endure that I should see Mary Avenel&#39;s eyes again flash with joy at the restoration of her lover.
My fierce, turbid, and transitory joy discharged itself in a thirst to commit homicide, and how can I estimate the frenzy of my despair?” “Madman!” said the Sub-Prior, “at what dreadful crime does thy fury drive?” “My lot is determined, father,” said Edward, in a resolute tone; “I will embrace the spiritual state which you have so oft recommended.
His heart always was, as well as seemed to be, in the duty which he was immediately performing; and the spiritual guide who thus shows a deep conviction of the importance of his office, seldom fails to impress a similar feeling upon his hearers.
Believe me, my father, for, by heaven and earth, I say nought but what I saw with these eyes!” “I believe thee, my son,” said the monk; “proceed in thy strange story.” “The apparition,” said Edward Glendinning, “sung, and thus ran her lay; for, strange as it may seem to you, her words abide by my remembrance as if they had been sung to me from infancy upward:-- &#39;Thou who seek&#39;st my fountain lone, With thoughts and hopes thou dar&#39;st not own; Whose heart within leap&#39;d wildly glad When most his brow seem&#39;d dark and sad; Hie thee back, thou find&#39;st not here Corpse or coffin, grave or bier; The Dead Alive is gone and fled-- Go thou, and join the Living Dead!
Edward, thou shalt go with me as thou desirest; thou shalt prove the life for which I have long thought thee best fitted--thou shalt aid, my son, this trembling hand of mine to sustain the Holy Ark, which bold unhallowed men press rashly forward to touch and to profane.--Wilt thou not first see thy mother?” “I will see no one,” said Edward, hastily; “I will risk nothing that may shake the purpose of my heart.
In truth, the chief distinction betwixt them was, that the Catholic, defending a religion which afforded little interest to the feelings, had, in his devotion to the cause he espoused, more of the head than of the heart, and was politic, cautious, and artful; while the Protestant, acting under the strong impulse of more lately-adopted conviction, and feeling, as he justly might, a more animated confidence in his cause, was enthusiastic, eager, and precipitate in his desire to advance it.
They could not part from each other without a second pressure of hands, and each looked in the face of his old companion, as he bade him adieu, with a countenance strongly expressive of sorrow, affection, and pity.
But this man and I are old friends, and I trust to bring him back from the paths of perdition.” “Nay,” said the moss-trooper, “when I saw you shake hands at the beginning I counted that you would fight it all out in love and honour, and that there would be no extreme dealings betwixt ye--however it is all one to my master--Saint Mary!
By my faith, it will cost him a brush; for wot ye what they say of that name,-- “Twixt Wigton and the town of Ayr, Portpatrick and the cruives of Cree, No man need think for to bide there, Unless he court Saint Kennedie.
God hath touched his heart, and he proposeth laying aside the vanities of the world, to become a brother of our holy order; which, if his good parts be matched with fitting docility and humility, he may one day live to adorn.” “My very venerable brother,” exclaimed old Father Nicholas, who came hobbling with a third summons to the Sub-Prior, “I pray thee to hasten to our worshipful Lord Abbot.
marry, that while he could crook his little finger he would keep hold of the crosier with it.” The Sacristan also strongly remonstrated against the resolution of his Superior, and set down the insufficiency he pleaded to the native modesty of his disposition.
When Father Eustace considered the number of the immediate vassals of the church whose aid he might legally command, his heart sunk at the thoughts of ranking them under the banner of the fierce and profligate Julian Avenel.
He took heart, however, upon seeing the open, frank, and friendly demeanor of the youth, and vented his exclamations on the ungrateful old traitress.
Piercie Shafton is alive and well; by the same token that the gull is thought to be detained there by love to a miller&#39;s daughter, who roamed the country with him in disguise.” “Glendinning,” said Murray, bending his brow into his darkest frown, “thou hast not, I trust, dared to bring me a lie in thy mouth, in order to win my confidence?” “My lord,” said Halbert, “I am incapable of a lie.
“Glendinning,” said Murray, “sound trumpets to horse directly, and let all who love us get on horseback without delay--Yes, my lord, this were indeed a fatal dilemma.
“Marry, and amen, with all my heart,” said the wounded man, “there will be company enow without thee where I am going.

Highly honoured are we all in this distinguished summons, from our dear brother Nicholas, whose gray hairs have been preserved until they should be surrounded by the crown of martyrdom, down to my beloved son Edward, who, arriving at the vineyard at the latest hour of the day, is yet permitted to share its toils with those who have laboured from the morning.

“It is well our Father Boniface hath retired to the inland,” said Father Philip; “he could never have put over this day--it would have broken his heart!” “God be with the soul of Abbot Ingelram!” said old Father Nicholas, “there were no such doings in his days.--They say we are to be put forth of the cloisters; and how I am to live any where else than where I have lived for these seventy years, I wot not--the best is, that I have not long to live any where.” A few moments after this the great gate of the Abbey was flung open, and the procession moved slowly forward from beneath its huge and richly-adorned gateway.

Bethink you how long you have thought with one mind, seen with one eye, heard with one ear, confirmed by your union the congregation of the Church, appalled by your joint authority the congregation of Anti-Christ; and will you now fall into discord, about an old decayed castle and a few barren hills, about the loves and likings of an humble spearman, and a damsel bred in the same obscurity, or about the still vainer questions of idle genealogy?” “The good man hath spoken right, noble Douglas,” said Murray, reaching him his hand, “our union is too essential to the good cause to be broken off upon such idle terms of dissension.
this is a land of hatred and bloodshed--let us not chase from thence the few traces that remain of gentle and domestic love.--And be not too eager for wealth to thy noble kinsman, my Lord of Morton, seeing contentment in the marriage state no way depends on it.” “If you allude to my family misfortune,” said Morton, whose Countess, wedded by him for her estate and honours, was insane in her mind, “the habit you wear, and the liberty, or rather license, of your profession, protect you from my resentment.” “Alas!
“Laugh on,” he said at length, “laugh on, my masters,” shrugging his shoulders; “it is not for me to be offended--yet would I know full fain from that squire who is laughing with the loudest, how he had discovered this unhappy blot in an otherwise spotless lineage, and for what purpose he hath made it known?” “_I_ make it known?” said Halbert Glendinning, in astonishment,--for to him this pathetic appeal was made,--“I never heard the thing till this moment.” [Footnote: The contrivance of provoking the irritable vanity of Sir Piercie Shafton, by presenting him with a bodkin, indicative of his descent from a tailor, is borrowed from a German romance, by the celebrated Tieck, called Das Peter Manchem, _i.
The youthful baron, the owner of the haunted castle, falls in love with a maiden, the daughter of a neighbouring count, a man of great pride, who refuses him the hand of the young lady, on account of his own superiority of descent.
The lover, repulsed and affronted, returns to take counsel with the Dwarf Peter, how he may silence the count, and obtain the victory in the argument, the next time they enter on the topic of pedigree.
The count, understanding it as an allusion to a misalliance of one of his ancestors with the daughter of a blacksmith, is thrown into a dreadful passion with the young lover, the consequences of which are the seduction of the young lady, and the slaughter of her father.
I must learn to know the Maid of Avenel--to-morrow I must act as her father--All Scotland shall see how Murray can reward a faithful servant.” Mary Avenel and her lover avoided meeting the Abbot, and took up their temporary abode in a house of the village, where next day their hands were united by the Protestant preacher in presence of the two Earls.
The two trusty servants made their vision only known to Dame Glendinning, who, with much pride of heart, had accompanied her son to see him take his rank among the barons of the land.
Vainly did my magic sleight Send the lover from her sight; Wither bush, and perish well, Fall&#39;n is lofty Avenel!” The vision seemed to weep while she sung; and the words impressed on Edward a melancholy belief, that the alliance of Mary with his brother might be fatal to them both.

She had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation; and such of their acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as handsome as Miss Maria, did not scruple to predict their marrying with almost equal advantage.
But Miss Frances married, in the common phrase, to disoblige her family, and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines, without education, fortune, or connexions, did it very thoroughly.
It was the natural result of the conduct of each party, and such as a very imprudent marriage almost always produces.
To save herself from useless remonstrance, Mrs. Price never wrote to her family on the subject till actually married.
By the end of eleven years, however, Mrs. Price could no longer afford to cherish pride or resentment, or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her.
He thought of his own four children, of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc.
The very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect, would be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-tempered boys in love with her.
Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love; and, though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children, nor consider her, in any respect, so much my own, I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her.
My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm heart; and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing.
As far as walking, talking, and contriving reached, she was thoroughly benevolent, and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others; but her love of money was equal to her love of directing, and she knew quite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends.
Having married on a narrower income than she had been used to look forward to, she had, from the first, fancied a very strict line of economy necessary; and what was begun as a matter of prudence, soon grew into a matter of choice, as an object of that needful solicitude which there were no children to supply.
Under this infatuating principle, counteracted by no real affection for her sister, it was impossible for her to aim at more than the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity; though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk home to the Parsonage, after this conversation, in the happy belief of being the most liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world.
Her elder cousins mortified her by reflections on her size, and abashed her by noticing her shyness: Miss Lee wondered at her ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered at her clothes; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers and sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow, instructress, and nurse, the despondence that sunk her little heart was severe.
“You are sorry to leave Mama, my dear little Fanny,” said he, “which shows you to be a very good girl; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends, who all love you, and wish to make you happy.
He wrote with his own hand his love to his cousin William, and sent him half a guinea under the seal.
He talked to her more, and, from all that she said, was convinced of her having an affectionate heart, and a strong desire of doing right; and he could perceive her to be farther entitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation, and great timidity.
Sir Thomas did not know what was wanting, because, though a truly anxious father, he was not outwardly affectionate, and the reserve of his manner repressed all the flow of their spirits before him.
Their eager affection in meeting, their exquisite delight in being together, their hours of happy mirth, and moments of serious conference, may be imagined; as well as the sanguine views and spirits of the boy even to the last, and the misery of the girl when he left her.
Miss Lee taught her French, and heard her read the daily portion of history; but he recommended the books which charmed her leisure hours, he encouraged her taste, and corrected her judgment: he made reading useful by talking to her of what she read, and heightened its attraction by judicious praise.
In return for such services she loved him better than anybody in the world except William: her heart was divided between the two.
She had never received kindness from her aunt Norris, and could not love her.
It can make very little difference to you, whether you are in one house or the other.” Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she could not feel the difference to be so small, she could not think of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction.
She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought, and I am glad her love of money does not interfere.
I love this house and everything in it: I shall love nothing there.
You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sure you have a grateful heart, that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it.
_Here_, I know, I am of none, and yet I love the place so well.” “The place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you quit the house.
Even _your_ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change.
I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it.” “No; he only said he thought it very likely; and I thought so too.
“Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself; nobody more hated pitiful doings; the Parsonage, she believed, had never been wanting in comforts of any sort, had never borne a bad character in _her_ _time_, but this was a way of going on that she could not understand.
Their father was no object of love to them; he had never seemed the friend of their pleasures, and his absence was unhappily most welcome.
The earliest intelligence of the travellers’ safe arrival at Antigua, after a favourable voyage, was received; though not before Mrs. Norris had been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmund participate them whenever she could get him alone; and as she depended on being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe, she had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others, when Sir Thomas’s assurances of their both being alive and well made it necessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches for a while.
As to her cousins’ gaieties, she loved to hear an account of them, especially of the balls, and whom Edmund had danced with; but thought too lowly of her own situation to imagine she should ever be admitted to the same, and listened, therefore, without an idea of any nearer concern in them.
“If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to return, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria well married,” she very often thought; always when they were in the company of men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of a young man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and finest places in the country.
Mr. Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of Miss Bertram, and, being inclined to marry, soon fancied himself in love.
Being now in her twenty-first year, Maria Bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty; and as a marriage with Mr. Rushworth would give her the enjoyment of a larger income than her father’s, as well as ensure her the house in town, which was now a prime object, it became, by the same rule of moral obligation, her evident duty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she could.
Mrs. Rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that her son should marry, and declared that of all the young ladies she had ever seen, Miss Bertram seemed, by her amiable qualities and accomplishments, the best adapted to make him happy.
After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the young people justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a due reference to the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into, much to the satisfaction of their respective families, and of the general lookers-on of the neighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt the expediency of Mr. Rushworth’s marrying Miss Bertram.
He only conditioned that the marriage should not take place before his return, which he was again looking eagerly forward to.
Such was the state of affairs in the month of July; and Fanny had just reached her eighteenth year, when the society of the village received an addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and Miss Crawford, the children of her mother by a second marriage.
As children, their sister had been always very fond of them; but, as her own marriage had been soon followed by the death of their common parent, which left them to the care of a brother of their father, of whom Mrs. Grant knew nothing, she had scarcely seen them since.
Admiral and Mrs. Crawford, though agreeing in nothing else, were united in affection for these children, or, at least, were no farther adverse in their feelings than that each had their favourite, to whom they showed the greatest fondness of the two.
The arrival, therefore, of a sister whom she had always loved, and now hoped to retain with her as long as she remained single, was highly agreeable; and her chief anxiety was lest Mansfield should not satisfy the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used to London.
Miss Crawford found a sister without preciseness or rusticity, a sister’s husband who looked the gentleman, and a house commodious and well fitted up; and Mrs. Grant received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young man and woman of very prepossessing appearance.
Matrimony was her object, provided she could marry well: and having seen Mr. Bertram in town, she knew that objection could no more be made to his person than to his situation in life.
I should dearly love to settle you both in this country; and therefore, Henry, you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram, a nice, handsome, good-humoured, accomplished girl, who will make you very happy.” Henry bowed and thanked her.
If you can persuade Henry to marry, you must have the address of a Frenchwoman.
I have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn; and the pains which they, their mothers (very clever women), as well as my dear aunt and myself, have taken to reason, coax, or trick him into marrying, is inconceivable!
He is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined.
I assure you he is very detestable; the Admiral’s lessons have quite spoiled him.” “I pay very little regard,” said Mrs. Grant, “to what any young person says on the subject of marriage.
I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly: I do not like to have people throw themselves away; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage.” CHAPTER V The young people were pleased with each other from the first.
Miss Bertram’s engagement made him in equity the property of Julia, of which Julia was fully aware; and before he had been at Mansfield a week, she was quite ready to be fallen in love with.
He did not want them to die of love; but with sense and temper which ought to have made him judge and feel better, he allowed himself great latitude on such points.
All is safe with a lady engaged: no harm can be done.” “Why, as to that, Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man, and it is a great match for her.” “But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him; _that_ is your opinion of your intimate friend.
Everybody is taken in at some period or other.” “Not always in marriage, dear Mary.” “In marriage especially.
With all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married, my dear Mrs. Grant, there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry.
You have been in a bad school for matrimony, in Hill Street.” “My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state; but, however, speaking from my own observation, it is a manoeuvring business.
I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion, or accomplishment, or good quality in the person, who have found themselves entirely deceived, and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse.
I never saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life; and it is so forlorn that I do not know what can be done with it.” “No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present,” said Mrs. Grant to Mrs. Norris, with a smile; “but depend upon it, Sotherton will have _every_ improvement in time which his heart can desire.” “I must try to do something with it,” said Mr. Rushworth, “but I do not know what.
Mr. Rushworth, however, though not usually a great talker, had still more to say on the subject next his heart.
Henry is different; he loves to be doing.” Edmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford, whom he was much disposed to admire, speak so freely of her uncle.
“I shall be most happy to play to you both,” said Miss Crawford; “at least as long as you can like to listen: probably much longer, for I dearly love music myself, and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off, for she is gratified in more ways than one.
Henry, who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults me, confides in me, and will talk to me by the hour together, has never yet turned the page in a letter; and very often it is nothing more than—‘Dear Mary, I am just arrived.
With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford, without throwing a shade on the Admiral.
She made me almost laugh; but I cannot rate so very highly the love or good-nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters, when they are separated.
A young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as elegant as herself, and both placed near a window, cut down to the ground, and opening on a little lawn, surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer, was enough to catch any man’s heart.
Mrs. Grant and her tambour frame were not without their use: it was all in harmony; and as everything will turn to account when love is once set going, even the sandwich tray, and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it, were worth looking at.
Without studying the business, however, or knowing what he was about, Edmund was beginning, at the end of a week of such intercourse, to be a good deal in love; and to the credit of the lady it may be added that, without his being a man of the world or an elder brother, without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk, he began to be agreeable to her.
“It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding!” said he.
Fanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of her arrival at the Park.
Mrs. Norris had no affection for Fanny, and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time; but her opposition to Edmund _now_, arose more from partiality for her own scheme, because it _was_ her own, than from anything else.
She could not tell Miss Crawford that “those woods belonged to Sotherton,” she could not carelessly observe that “she believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth’s property on each side of the road,” without elation of heart; and it was a pleasure to increase with their approach to the capital freehold mansion, and ancient manorial residence of the family, with all its rights of court-leet and court-baron.
“Upon my word, it is really a pity that it should not take place directly, if we had but a proper licence, for here we are altogether, and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant.” And she talked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the comprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his mother, and expose her sister to the whispered gallantries of her lover, while Mrs. Rushworth spoke with proper smiles and dignity of its being a most happy event to her whenever it took place.
The politeness which she had been brought up to practise as a duty made it impossible for her to escape; while the want of that higher species of self-command, that just consideration of others, that knowledge of her own heart, that principle of right, which had not formed any essential part of her education, made her miserable under it.
Men love to distinguish themselves, and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained, but not in the church.
Do not you think we have?” “Not half a mile,” was his sturdy answer; for he was not yet so much in love as to measure distance, or reckon time, with feminine lawlessness.
Your sister loves to laugh.” “You think her more light-hearted than I am?” “More easily amused,” he replied; “consequently, you know,” smiling, “better company.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>His business was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take his passage in the September packet, and he consequently looked forward with the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November.
Maria was more to be pitied than Julia; for to her the father brought a husband, and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness would unite her to the lover, on whom she had chosen that happiness should depend.
“Your father’s return will be a very interesting event.” “It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but including so many dangers.” “It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your sister’s marriage, and your taking orders.” “Yes.” “Don’t be affronted,” said she, laughing, “but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits in a foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return.” “There is no sacrifice in the case,” replied Edmund, with a serious smile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; “it is entirely her own doing.” “Oh yes I know it is.
Indolence and love of ease; a want of all laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable, which make men clergymen.
Here’s what may tranquillise every care, and lift the heart to rapture!
It was very vexatious, and she was heartily sorry for it; but so it was; and so far from now meaning to marry the elder, she did not even want to attract him beyond what the simplest claims of conscious beauty required: his lengthened absence from Mansfield, without anything but pleasure in view, and his own will to consult, made it perfectly clear that he did not care about her; and his indifference was so much more than equalled by her own, that were he now to step forth the owner of Mansfield Park, the Sir Thomas complete, which he was to be in time, she did not believe she could accept him.
He has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove.” “If Miss Bertram were not engaged,” said Fanny cautiously, “I could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia.” “Which is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking Julia best, than you, Fanny, may be aware; for I believe it often happens that a man, before he has quite made up his own mind, will distinguish the sister or intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman herself.
It was Fanny’s first ball, though without the preparation or splendour of many a young lady’s first ball, being the thought only of the afternoon, built on the late acquisition of a violin player in the servants’ hall, and the possibility of raising five couple with the help of Mrs. Grant and a new intimate friend of Mr. Bertram’s just arrived on a visit.
They had need be _all_ in love, to find any amusement in such folly; and so they are, I fancy.
If you look at them you may see they are so many couple of lovers—all but Yates and Mrs. Grant—and, between ourselves, she, poor woman, must want a lover as much as any one of them.
Happily for him, a love of the theatre is so general, an itch for acting so strong among young people, that he could hardly out-talk the interest of his hearers.
“Nobody loves a play better than you do, or can have gone much farther to see one.” “True, to see real acting, good hardened real acting; but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade: a set of gentlemen and ladies, who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through.” After a short pause, however, the subject still continued, and was discussed with unabated eagerness, every one’s inclination increasing by the discussion, and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest; and though nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy, and his sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in the world could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all, the resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as to make Edmund quite uncomfortable.
There could be no harm in what had been done in so many respectable families, and by so many women of the first consideration; and it must be scrupulousness run mad that could see anything to censure in a plan like theirs, comprehending only brothers and sisters and intimate friends, and which would never be heard of beyond themselves.
No want of understrappers: my sister desires her love, and hopes to be admitted into the company, and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante, that you may not like to do yourselves.” Maria gave Edmund a glance, which meant, “What say you now?
Can we be wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same?” And Edmund, silenced, was obliged to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carry fascination to the mind of genius; and with the ingenuity of love, to dwell more on the obliging, accommodating purport of the message than on anything else.
The storm through Baron Wildenheim was the height of his theatrical ambition; and with the advantage of knowing half the scenes by heart already, he did now, with the greatest alacrity, offer his services for the part.
I do not know how I shall like it.” Fanny’s eyes followed Edmund, and her heart beat for him as she heard this speech, and saw his look, and felt what his sensations must be.
In all points of decorum _your_ conduct must be law to the rest of the party.” This picture of her consequence had some effect, for no one loved better to lead than Maria; and with far more good-humour she answered, “I am much obliged to you, Edmund; you mean very well, I am sure: but I still think you see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind.
What gentleman among you am I to have the pleasure of making love to?” For a moment no one spoke; and then many spoke together to tell the same melancholy truth, that they had not yet got any Anhalt.
I have forty-two to learn.” “It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart,” said Fanny, shocked to find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room, and to feel that almost every eye was upon her; “but I really cannot act.” “Yes, yes, you can act well enough for _us_.
Fanny did not love Miss Crawford; but she felt very much obliged to her for her present kindness; and when, from taking notice of her work, and wishing _she_ could work as well, and begging for the pattern, and supposing Fanny was now preparing for her _appearance_, as of course she would come out when her cousin was married, Miss Crawford proceeded to inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea, and said that she had quite a curiosity to see him, and imagined him a very fine young man, and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea again—she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery, or help listening, and answering with more animation than she had intended.
Everything was a friend, or bore her thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes much of suffering to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood, her feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued; though she had known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost every recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her aunt Bertram had spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what was yet more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion and her friend: he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had told her not to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which made her tears delightful; and the whole was now so blended together, so harmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm.
One advantage resulted from it to Fanny: at the earnest request of Miss Crawford, Mrs. Grant had, with her usual good-humour, agreed to undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted; and this was all that occurred to gladden _her_ heart during the day; and even this, when imparted by Edmund, brought a pang with it, for it was Miss Crawford to whom she was obliged—it was Miss Crawford whose kind exertions were to excite her gratitude, and whose merit in making them was spoken of with a glow of admiration.
Her heart and her judgment were equally against Edmund’s decision: she could not acquit his unsteadiness, and his happiness under it made her wretched.
Fanny’s heart was not absolutely the only saddened one amongst them, as she soon began to acknowledge to herself.
For a day or two after the affront was given, Henry Crawford had endeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and compliment, but he had not cared enough about it to persevere against a few repulses; and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for more than one flirtation, he grew indifferent to the quarrel, or rather thought it a lucky occurrence, as quietly putting an end to what might ere long have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant.
“I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry,” was her observation to Mary.
I am sure _Julia_ does not, or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates; and though he and Maria are very good friends, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant.” “I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed.” “If you have such a suspicion, something must be done; and as soon as the play is all over, we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind; and if he means nothing, we will send him off, though he is Henry, for a time.” Julia _did_ suffer, however, though Mrs. Grant discerned it not, and though it escaped the notice of many of her own family likewise.
She had loved, she did love still, and she had all the suffering which a warm temper and a high spirit were likely to endure under the disappointment of a dear, though irrational hope, with a strong sense of ill-usage.
Her heart was sore and angry, and she was capable only of angry consolations.
With no material fault of temper, or difference of opinion, to prevent their being very good friends while their interests were the same, the sisters, under such a trial as this, had not affection or principle enough to make them merciful or just, to give them honour or compassion.
Edmund, between his theatrical and his real part, between Miss Crawford’s claims and his own conduct, between love and consistency, was equally unobservant; and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company, superintending their various dresses with economical expedient, for which nobody thanked her, and saving, with delighted integrity, half a crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for watching the behaviour, or guarding the happiness of his daughters.
The whole subject of it was love—a marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman, and very little short of a declaration of love be made by the lady.
By the bye, I looked in upon them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying _not_ to embrace, and Mr. Rushworth was with me.
Everybody was satisfied; and she was left to the tremors of a most palpitating heart, while the others prepared to begin.
Mr. Yates might consider it only as a vexatious interruption for the evening, and Mr. Rushworth might imagine it a blessing; but every other heart was sinking under some degree of self-condemnation or undefined alarm, every other heart was suggesting, “What will become of us?
Jealousy and bitterness had been suspended: selfishness was lost in the common cause; but at the moment of her appearance, Frederick was listening with looks of devotion to Agatha’s narrative, and pressing her hand to his heart; and as soon as she could notice this, and see that, in spite of the shock of her words, he still kept his station and retained her sister’s hand, her wounded heart swelled again with injury, and looking as red as she had been white before, she turned out of the room, saying, “_I_ need not be afraid of appearing before him.” Her going roused the rest; and at the same moment the two brothers stepped forward, feeling the necessity of doing something.
She had been quite overlooked by her cousins; and as her own opinion of her claims on Sir Thomas’s affection was much too humble to give her any idea of classing herself with his children, she was glad to remain behind and gain a little breathing-time.
Why do not I see my little Fanny?”—and on perceiving her, came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her, calling her his dear Fanny, kissing her affectionately, and observing with decided pleasure how much she was grown!
He inquired next after her family, especially William: and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little, and thinking his return a misfortune; and when, on having courage to lift her eyes to his face, she saw that he was grown thinner, and had the burnt, fagged, worn look of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender feeling was increased, and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him.
His immediate communications were exhausted, and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him, now at one, now at another of the beloved circle; but the pause was not long: in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative, and what were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say, “How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately, Sir Thomas?
“It is time to think of our visitors,” said Maria, still feeling her hand pressed to Henry Crawford’s heart, and caring little for anything else.
of unquietness, but prevented him even from seeing the expression of the face on which his own eyes were fixed—from seeing Sir Thomas’s dark brow contract as he looked with inquiring earnestness at his daughters and Edmund, dwelling particularly on the latter, and speaking a language, a remonstrance, a reproof, which _he_ felt at his heart.
Do you find them agreeable acquaintance?” Tom was the only one at all ready with an answer, but he being entirely without particular regard for either, without jealousy either in love or acting, could speak very handsomely of both.
I thought we should never have got through them, though we had the four horses of course; and poor old coachman would attend us, out of his great love and kindness, though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since Michaelmas.
I cured him at last; but he was very bad all the winter—and this was such a day, I could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture: he was putting on his wig; so I said, ‘Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady and I shall be very safe; you know how steady Stephen is, and Charles has been upon the leaders so often now, that I am sure there is no fear.’ But, however, I soon found it would not do; he was bent upon going, and as I hate to be worrying and officious, I said no more; but my heart quite ached for him at every jolt, and when we got into the rough lanes about Stoke, where, what with frost and snow upon beds of stones, it was worse than anything you can imagine, I was quite in an agony about him.
‘Upon my word, Mrs. Norris,’ said Mrs. Grant the other day, ‘if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own, he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect.’” Sir Thomas gave up the point, foiled by her evasions, disarmed by her flattery; and was obliged to rest satisfied with the conviction that where the present pleasure of those she loved was at stake, her kindness did sometimes overpower her judgment.
Sir Thomas soon appeared, and Maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of the man she loved to her father.
The hand which had so pressed hers to his heart!
the hand and the heart were alike motionless and passive now!
Mrs. Norris began to look about her, and wonder that his falling in love with Julia had come to nothing; and could almost fear that she had been remiss herself in forwarding it; but with so many to care for, how was it possible for even _her_ activity to keep pace with her wishes?
I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies.
Mr. Rushworth must and would improve in good society; and if Maria could now speak so securely of her happiness with him, speaking certainly without the prejudice, the blindness of love, she ought to be believed.
A well-disposed young woman, who did not marry for love, was in general but the more attached to her own family; and the nearness of Sotherton to Mansfield must naturally hold out the greatest temptation, and would, in all probability, be a continual supply of the most amiable and innocent enjoyments.
Such and such-like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas, happy to escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture, the wonder, the reflections, the reproach that must attend it; happy to secure a marriage which would bring him such an addition of respectability and influence, and very happy to think anything of his daughter’s disposition that was most favourable for the purpose.
Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four days after Henry Crawford’s leaving Mansfield, before her feelings were at all tranquillised, before she had given up every hope of him, or absolutely resolved on enduring his rival, her answer might have been different; but after another three or four days, when there was no return, no letter, no message, no symptom of a softened heart, no hope of advantage from separation, her mind became cool enough to seek all the comfort that pride and self revenge could give.
To such feelings delay, even the delay of much preparation, would have been an evil, and Mr. Rushworth could hardly be more impatient for the marriage than herself.
In all the important preparations of the mind she was complete: being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home, restraint, and tranquillity; by the misery of disappointed affection, and contempt of the man she was to marry.
Even their mother missed them; and how much more their tenderhearted cousin, who wandered about the house, and thought of them, and felt for them, with a degree of affectionate regret which they had never done much to deserve!
Fanny went to her every two or three days: it seemed a kind of fascination: she could not be easy without going, and yet it was without loving her, without ever thinking like her, without any sense of obligation for being sought after now when nobody else was to be had; and deriving no higher pleasure from her conversation than occasional amusement, and _that_ often at the expense of her judgment, when it was raised by pleasantry on people or subjects which she wished to be respected.
One cannot fix one’s eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy.” “To say the truth,” replied Miss Crawford, “I am something like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.
But then,” with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice, “there is no saying what it may lead to.” Fanny’s heart beat quick, and she felt quite unequal to surmising or soliciting anything more.
A friendship between two so very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished: and to the credit of the lover’s understanding, be it stated, that he did not by any means consider Fanny as the only, or even as the greater gainer by such a friendship.
“Now I must look at you, Fanny,” said Edmund, with the kind smile of an affectionate brother, “and tell you how I like you; and as well as I can judge by this light, you look very nicely indeed.
What have you got on?” “The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin’s marriage.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>No, my plan is to make Fanny Price in love with me.” “Fanny Price!
You ought to be satisfied with her two cousins.” “But I cannot be satisfied without Fanny Price, without making a small hole in Fanny Price’s heart.
Her eyes should be darker, but she has a sweet smile; but as for this wonderful degree of improvement, I am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress, and your having nobody else to look at; and therefore, if you do set about a flirtation with her, you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty, or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly.” Her brother gave only a smile to this accusation, and soon afterwards said, “I do not quite know what to make of Miss Fanny.
And so this is her attraction after all!
I do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy; a _little_ love, perhaps, may animate and do her good, but I will not have you plunge her deep, for she is as good a little creature as ever lived, and has a great deal of feeling.” “It can be but for a fortnight,” said Henry; “and if a fortnight can kill her, she must have a constitution which nothing could save.
Well, you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself, for we are a great deal together.” And without attempting any farther remonstrance, she left Fanny to her fate, a fate which, had not Fanny’s heart been guarded in a way unsuspected by Miss Crawford, might have been a little harder than she deserved; for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young ladies of eighteen (or one should not read about them) as are never to be persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent, manner, attention, and flattery can do, I have no inclination to believe Fanny one of them, or to think that with so much tenderness of disposition, and so much taste as belonged to her, she could have escaped heart-whole from the courtship (though the courtship only of a fortnight) of such a man as Crawford, in spite of there being some previous ill opinion of him to be overcome, had not her affection been engaged elsewhere.
With all the security which love of another and disesteem of him could give to the peace of mind he was attacking, his continued attentions—continued, but not obtrusive, and adapting themselves more and more to the gentleness and delicacy of her character—obliged her very soon to dislike him less than formerly.
William, her brother, the so long absent and dearly loved brother, was in England again.
But his intention, the kindness of his intention, was thankfully acknowledged: quite thankfully and warmly, for she was elevated beyond the common timidity of her mind by the flow of her love for William.
It was long before Fanny could recover from the agitating happiness of such an hour as was formed by the last thirty minutes of expectation, and the first of fruition; it was some time even before her happiness could be said to make her happy, before the disappointment inseparable from the alteration of person had vanished, and she could see in him the same William as before, and talk to him, as her heart had been yearning to do through many a past year.
That time, however, did gradually come, forwarded by an affection on his side as warm as her own, and much less encumbered by refinement or self-distrust.
She was the first object of his love, but it was a love which his stronger spirits, and bolder temper, made it as natural for him to express as to feel.
Excepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked or unlooked-for instance of Edmund’s consideration of her in the last few months had excited, Fanny had never known so much felicity in her life, as in this unchecked, equal, fearless intercourse with the brother and friend who was opening all his heart to her, telling her all his hopes and fears, plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of, dearly earned, and justly valued blessing of promotion; who could give her direct and minute information of the father and mother, brothers and sisters, of whom she very seldom heard; who was interested in all the comforts and all the little hardships of her home at Mansfield; ready to think of every member of that home as she directed, or differing only by a less scrupulous opinion, and more noisy abuse of their aunt Norris, and with whom (perhaps the dearest indulgence of the whole) all the evil and good of their earliest years could be gone over again, and every former united pain and pleasure retraced with the fondest recollection.
An advantage this, a strengthener of love, in which even the conjugal tie is beneath the fraternal.
Fraternal love, sometimes almost everything, is at others worse than nothing.
An affection so amiable was advancing each in the opinion of all who had hearts to value anything good.
Fanny’s attractions increased—increased twofold; for the sensibility which beautified her complexion and illumined her countenance was an attraction in itself.
He was no longer in doubt of the capabilities of her heart.
It would be something to be loved by such a girl, to excite the first ardours of her young unsophisticated mind!
His heart was warmed, his fancy fired, and he felt the highest respect for a lad who, before he was twenty, had gone through such bodily hardships and given such proofs of mind.
The glory of heroism, of usefulness, of exertion, of endurance, made his own habits of selfish indulgence appear in shameful contrast; and he wished he had been a William Price, distinguishing himself and working his way to fortune and consequence with so much self-respect and happy ardour, instead of what he was!
It was a fine arrangement for Henry Crawford, who was close to Fanny, and with his hands full of business, having two persons’ cards to manage as well as his own; for though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself mistress of the rules of the game in three minutes, he had yet to inspirit her play, sharpen her avarice, and harden her heart, which, especially in any competition with William, was a work of some difficulty; and as for Lady Bertram, he must continue in charge of all her fame and fortune through the whole evening; and if quick enough to keep her from looking at her cards when the deal began, must direct her in whatever was to be done with them to the end of it.
His scheme was to rent the house himself the following winter, that he might have a home of his own in that neighbourhood; and it was not merely for the use of it in the hunting-season (as he was then telling her), though _that_ consideration had certainly some weight, feeling as he did that, in spite of all Dr. Grant’s very great kindness, it was impossible for him and his horses to be accommodated where they now were without material inconvenience; but his attachment to that neighbourhood did not depend upon one amusement or one season of the year: he had set his heart upon having a something there that he could come to at any time, a little homestall at his command, where all the holidays of his year might be spent, and he might find himself continuing, improving, and _perfecting_ that friendship and intimacy with the Mansfield Park family which was increasing in value to him every day.
You remember the Gregorys; they are grown up amazing fine girls, but they will hardly speak to _me_, because Lucy is courted by a lieutenant.” “Oh!
There were points on which they did not quite agree; there were moments in which she did not seem propitious; and though trusting altogether to her affection, so far as to be resolved—almost resolved—on bringing it to a decision within a very short time, as soon as the variety of business before him were arranged, and he knew what he had to offer her, he had many anxious feelings, many doubting hours as to the result.
Did she love him well enough to forego what had used to be essential points?
Did she love him well enough to make them no longer essential?
You must forgive the liberty, and oblige me.” Fanny still resisted, and from her heart.
But Miss Crawford persevered, and argued the case with so much affectionate earnestness through all the heads of William and the cross, and the ball, and herself, as to be finally successful.
I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste; but, at any rate, I know you will be kind to my intentions, and consider it, as it really is, a token of the love of one of your oldest friends.” And so saying, he was hurrying away, before Fanny, overpowered by a thousand feelings of pain and pleasure, could attempt to speak; but quickened by one sovereign wish, she then called out, “Oh!
It is without a drawback.” Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour without saying another word; but Edmund, after waiting a moment, obliged her to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying, “But what is it that you want to consult me about?” It was about the necklace, which she was now most earnestly longing to return, and hoped to obtain his approbation of her doing.
He would marry Miss Crawford.
It was her intention, as she felt it to be her duty, to try to overcome all that was excessive, all that bordered on selfishness, in her affection for Edmund.
She would endeavour to be rational, and to deserve the right of judging of Miss Crawford’s character, and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound intellect and an honest heart.
The enthusiasm of a woman’s love is even beyond the biographer’s.
But as it was, they parted with looks on his side of grateful affection, and with some very precious sensations on hers.
His, therefore, must be worn; and having, with delightful feelings, joined the chain and the cross—those memorials of the two most beloved of her heart, those dearest tokens so formed for each other by everything real and imaginary—and put them round her neck, and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were, she was able, without an effort, to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford’s necklace too.
The very gown you have been taking notice of is your own generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married.
When the carriages were really heard, when the guests began really to assemble, her own gaiety of heart was much subdued: the sight of so many strangers threw her back into herself; and besides the gravity and formality of the first great circle, which the manners of neither Sir Thomas nor Lady Bertram were of a kind to do away, she found herself occasionally called on to endure something worse.
Fanny’s heart sunk, but there was no leisure for thinking long even of Miss Crawford’s feelings.
She meant to be giving her little heart a happy flutter, and filling her with sensations of delightful self-consequence; and, misinterpreting Fanny’s blushes, still thought she must be doing so when she went to her after the two first dances, and said, with a significant look, “Perhaps _you_ can tell me why my brother goes to town to-morrow?
But it was not to be avoided: he made her feel that she was the object of all; though she could not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacy or ostentation in his manner; and sometimes, when he talked of William, he was really not unagreeable, and shewed even a warmth of heart which did him credit.
Mr. Crawford was in love with Fanny.
CHAPTER XXIX The ball was over, and the breakfast was soon over too; the last kiss was given, and William was gone.
After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to the breakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy change; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace, conceiving, perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in William’s plate might but divide her feelings with the broken egg-shells in Mr. Crawford’s.
Everything that a considerate parent _ought_ to feel was advanced for her use; and everything that an affectionate mother _must_ feel in promoting her children’s enjoyment was attributed to her nature.
Angry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions, and acting on them in defiance of her (and she had been so angry that they had hardly parted friends at the ball), she could not help thinking of him continually when absent, dwelling on his merit and affection, and longing again for the almost daily meetings they lately had.
She wished such words unsaid with all her heart.
But I dare say you know exactly—I always imagine you are—perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all—or not at present.” “No, I do not,” said Fanny softly, hoping she did not err either in the belief or the acknowledgment of it.
No: you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price.” The surprise was now complete; for, in spite of whatever his consciousness might suggest, a suspicion of his having any such views had never entered his sister’s imagination; and she looked so truly the astonishment she felt, that he was obliged to repeat what he had said, and more fully and more solemnly.
Mary was in a state of mind to rejoice in a connexion with the Bertram family, and to be not displeased with her brother’s marrying a little beneath him.
The Admiral hated marriage, and thought it never pardonable in a young man of independent fortune.
Were you even less pleasing—supposing her not to love you already (of which, however, I can have little doubt)—you would be safe.
From my soul I do not think she would marry you _without_ love; that is, if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition, I can suppose it her; but ask her to love you, and she will never have the heart to refuse.” As soon as her eagerness could rest in silence, he was as happy to tell as she could be to listen; and a conversation followed almost as deeply interesting to her as to himself, though he had in fact nothing to relate but his own sensations, nothing to dwell on but Fanny’s charms.
Fanny’s beauty of face and figure, Fanny’s graces of manner and goodness of heart, were the exhaustless theme.
The gentleness, modesty, and sweetness of her character were warmly expatiated on; that sweetness which makes so essential a part of every woman’s worth in the judgment of man, that though he sometimes loves where it is not, he can never believe it absent.
What could more delightfully prove that the warmth of her heart was equal to its gentleness?
What could be more encouraging to a man who had her love in view?
_You_ are not sensible of the gain, for your regard for him has blinded you; but, in my estimation, your marrying early may be the saving of you.
I must have them love one another.” Mary refrained from saying what she felt, that there could not be two persons in existence whose characters and manners were less accordant: time would discover it to him; but she could not help _this_ reflection on the Admiral.
“Henry, I think so highly of Fanny Price, that if I could suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill-used aunt had to abhor the very name, I would prevent the marriage, if possible; but I know you: I know that a wife you _loved_ would be the happiest of women, and that even when you ceased to love, she would yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding of a gentleman.” The impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make Fanny Price happy, or of ceasing to love Fanny Price, was of course the groundwork of his eloquent answer.
Had you seen her so, Mary, you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing.” “My dearest Henry,” cried Mary, stopping short, and smiling in his face, “how glad I am to see you so much in love!
While her hand was trembling under these letters, her eye running from one to the other, and her heart swelling with emotion, Crawford thus continued, with unfeigned eagerness, to express his interest in the event— “I will not talk of my own happiness,” said he, “great as it is, for I think only of yours.
He had communicated it to no creature: he had not breathed a syllable of it even to Mary; while uncertain of the issue, he could not have borne any participation of his feelings, but this had been his business; and he spoke with such a glow of what his solicitude had been, and used such strong expressions, was so abounding in the _deepest_ _interest_, in _twofold_ _motives_, in _views_ _and_ _wishes_ _more_ _than_ _could_ _be_ _told_, that Fanny could not have remained insensible of his drift, had she been able to attend; but her heart was so full and her senses still so astonished, that she could listen but imperfectly even to what he told her of William, and saying only when he paused, “How kind!
When she did understand it, however, and found herself expected to believe that she had created sensations which his heart had never known before, and that everything he had done for William was to be placed to the account of his excessive and unequalled attachment to her, she was exceedingly distressed, and for some moments unable to speak.
While her heart was still bounding with joy and gratitude on William’s behalf, she could not be severely resentful of anything that injured only herself; and after having twice drawn back her hand, and twice attempted in vain to turn away from him, she got up, and said only, with much agitation, “Don’t, Mr. Crawford, pray don’t!
I cannot bear it.” But he was still talking on, describing his affection, soliciting a return, and, finally, in words so plain as to bear but one meaning even to her, offering himself, hand, fortune, everything, to her acceptance.
How could _she_ have excited serious attachment in a man who had seen so many, and been admired by so many, and flirted with so many, infinitely her superiors; who seemed so little open to serious impressions, even where pains had been taken to please him; who thought so slightly, so carelessly, so unfeelingly on all such points; who was everything to everybody, and seemed to find no one essential to him?
Your aunt cannot be aware of this.” Fanny would rather have been silent; but being obliged to speak, she could not forbear, in justice to the aunt she loved best, from saying something in which the words “my aunt Norris” were distinguishable.
Mr. Crawford’s business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny, make decided proposals for her, and entreat the sanction of the uncle, who seemed to stand in the place of her parents; and he had done it all so well, so openly, so liberally, so properly, that Sir Thomas, feeling, moreover, his own replies, and his own remarks to have been very much to the purpose, was exceedingly happy to give the particulars of their conversation; and little aware of what was passing in his niece’s mind, conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her far more than himself.
For what reason?” “I—I cannot like him, sir, well enough to marry him.” “This is very strange!” said Sir Thomas, in a voice of calm displeasure.
His sister, moreover, is your intimate friend, and he has been doing _that_ for your brother, which I should suppose would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you, had there been no other.
“Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford’s _choice_ seemed to justify” said Sir Thomas, beginning again, and very composedly, “his wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me.
This is so much my opinion, that I am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son, your cousin, Mr. Bertram, is to marry early; but at present, as far as I can judge, matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts.
“Edmund, I consider, from his dispositions and habits, as much more likely to marry early than his brother.
_He_, indeed, I have lately thought, has seen the woman he could love, which, I am convinced, my eldest son has not.
But the removal of his alarm did his niece no service: as her unaccountableness was confirmed his displeasure increased; and getting up and walking about the room with a frown, which Fanny could picture to herself, though she dared not lift up her eyes, he shortly afterwards, and in a voice of authority, said, “Have you any reason, child, to think ill of Mr. Crawford’s temper?” “No, sir.” She longed to add, “But of his principles I have”; but her heart sunk under the appalling prospect of discussion, explanation, and probably non-conviction.
Maria is nobly married; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia’s hand, I should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria’s to Mr. Rushworth.” After half a moment’s pause: “And I should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters, on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only _half_ the eligibility of _this_, immediately and peremptorily, and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation, put a decided negative on it.
But, Fanny, if your heart can acquit you of _ingratitude_—” He ceased.
Her heart was almost broke by such a picture of what she appeared to him; by such accusations, so heavy, so multiplied, so rising in dreadful gradation!
He knew her to be very timid, and exceedingly nervous; and thought it not improbable that her mind might be in such a state as a little time, a little pressing, a little patience, and a little impatience, a judicious mixture of all on the lover’s side, might work their usual effect on.
If the gentleman would but persevere, if he had but love enough to persevere, Sir Thomas began to have hopes; and these reflections having passed across his mind and cheered it, “Well,” said he, in a tone of becoming gravity, but of less anger, “well, child, dry up your tears.
She could not but feel some resentment against Mr. Crawford; yet, if he really loved her, and were unhappy too!
Suffice it, that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous manner, and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding, heart, and temper.
There is no occasion for spreading the disappointment; say nothing about it yourself.” This was an order to be most joyfully obeyed; this was an act of kindness which Fanny felt at her heart.
For the purity of her intentions she could answer; and she was willing to hope, secondly, that her uncle’s displeasure was abating, and would abate farther as he considered the matter with more impartiality, and felt, as a good man must feel, how wretched, and how unpardonable, how hopeless, and how wicked it was to marry without affection.
She would not, could not believe, that Mr. Crawford’s affection for her could distress him long; his mind was not of that sort.
In London he would soon learn to wonder at his infatuation, and be thankful for the right reason in her which had saved him from its evil consequences.
He had vanity, which strongly inclined him in the first place to think she did love him, though she might not know it herself; and which, secondly, when constrained at last to admit that she did know her own present feelings, convinced him that he should be able in time to make those feelings what he wished.
He was in love, very much in love; and it was a love which, operating on an active, sanguine spirit, of more warmth than delicacy, made her affection appear of greater consequence because it was withheld, and determined him to have the glory, as well as the felicity, of forcing her to love him.
He knew not that he had a pre-engaged heart to attack.
Love such as his, in a man like himself, must with perseverance secure a return, and at no great distance; and he had so much delight in the idea of obliging her to love him in a very short time, that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted.
She told him that she did not love him, could not love him, was sure she never should love him; that such a change was quite impossible; that the subject was most painful to her; that she must entreat him never to mention it again, to allow her to leave him at once, and let it be considered as concluded for ever.
And when farther pressed, had added, that in her opinion their dispositions were so totally dissimilar as to make mutual affection incompatible; and that they were unfitted for each other by nature, education, and habit.
All this she had said, and with the earnestness of sincerity; yet this was not enough, for he immediately denied there being anything uncongenial in their characters, or anything unfriendly in their situations; and positively declared, that he would still love, and still hope!
He was now the Mr. Crawford who was addressing herself with ardent, disinterested love; whose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and upright, whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of attachment; who was pouring out his sense of her merits, describing and describing again his affection, proving as far as words could prove it, and in the language, tone, and spirit of a man of talent too, that he sought her for her gentleness and her goodness; and to complete the whole, he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William’s promotion!
how always known no principle to supply as a duty what the heart was deficient in.
So thought Fanny, in good truth and sober sadness, as she sat musing over that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs: wondering at the past and present; wondering at what was yet to come, and in a nervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of her being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford, and the felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it.
The first feeling was disappointment: he had hoped better things; he had thought that an hour’s entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked so little change on a gentle-tempered girl like Fanny; but there was speedy comfort in the determined views and sanguine perseverance of the lover; and when seeing such confidence of success in the principal, Sir Thomas was soon able to depend on it himself.
In all his niece’s family and friends, there could be but one opinion, one wish on the subject; the influence of all who loved her must incline one way.
He is a most extraordinary young man, and whatever be the event, you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common character; though, young as you are, and little acquainted with the transient, varying, unsteady nature of love, as it generally exists, you cannot be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against discouragement.
You cannot suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations.
He, who had married a daughter to Mr. Rushworth: romantic delicacy was certainly not to be expected from him.
It was all known at the Parsonage, where he loved to talk over the future with both his sisters, and it would be rather gratifying to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progress of his success.
To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of fortune, raised her, therefore, very much in her opinion.
By convincing her that Fanny _was_ very pretty, which she had been doubting about before, and that she would be advantageously married, it made her feel a sort of credit in calling her niece.
_You_ cannot wish me to marry; for you would miss me, should not you?
I could do very well without you, if you were married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford.
“I will tell you what, Fanny,” said she, “I am sure he fell in love with you at the ball; I am sure the mischief was done that evening.
It was enough to set his heart in a glow, and to bring him home in the properest state for feeling the full value of the other joyful surprises at hand.
It was designed only to express his participation in all that interested her, and to tell her that he had been hearing what quickened every feeling of affection.
It had every recommendation to him; and while honouring her for what she had done under the influence of her present indifference, honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas could quite echo, he was most earnest in hoping, and sanguine in believing, that it would be a match at last, and that, united by mutual affection, it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly fitted to make them blessed in each other, as he was now beginning seriously to consider them.
Edmund watched the progress of her attention, and was amused and gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework, which at the beginning seemed to occupy her totally: how it fell from her hand while she sat motionless over it, and at last, how the eyes which had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were turned and fixed on Crawford—fixed on him for minutes, fixed on him, in short, till the attraction drew Crawford’s upon her, and the book was closed, and the charm was broken.
His thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere; one is intimate with him by instinct.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>This would be the way to Fanny’s heart.
And I do not know that I should be fond of preaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice in the spring, after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together; but not for a constancy; it would not do for a constancy.” Here Fanny, who could not but listen, involuntarily shook her head, and Crawford was instantly by her side again, entreating to know her meaning; and as Edmund perceived, by his drawing in a chair, and sitting down close by her, that it was to be a very thorough attack, that looks and undertones were to be well tried, he sank as quietly as possible into a corner, turned his back, and took up a newspaper, very sincerely wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into explaining away that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her ardent lover; and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the business from himself in murmurs of his own, over the various advertisements of “A most desirable Estate in South Wales”; “To Parents and Guardians”; and a “Capital season’d Hunter.” Fanny, meanwhile, vexed with herself for not having been as motionless as she was speechless, and grieved to the heart to see Edmund’s arrangements, was trying by everything in the power of her modest, gentle nature, to repulse Mr. Crawford, and avoid both his looks and inquiries; and he, unrepulsable, was persisting in both.
It is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest, who loves you most devotedly, that has the best right to a return.
She had been used to consult him in every difficulty, and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her confidence now; he hoped to be of service to her, he thought he must be of service to her; whom else had she to open her heart to?
I dare say that, on a comparison of our opinions, they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be: to the point—I consider Crawford’s proposals as most advantageous and desirable, if you could return his affection.
How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love?
You did not love him; nothing could have justified your accepting him.” Fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days.
But” (with an affectionate smile) “let him succeed at last, Fanny, let him succeed at last.
I am aware, more aware than Crawford can be, that the man who means to make you love him (you having due notice of his intentions) must have very uphill work, for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array; and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate, which so many years’ growth have confirmed, and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation.
I must hope, however, that time, proving him (as I firmly believe it will) to deserve you by his steady affection, will give him his reward.
I cannot suppose that you have not the _wish_ to love him—the natural wish of gratitude.
I have heard before from some one of his being in love with Julia; but I could never see anything of it.
I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society; and with such encouragement, a man like Crawford, lively, and it may be, a little unthinking, might be led on to—there could be nothing very striking, because it is clear that he had no pretensions: his heart was reserved for you.
I should not have mentioned the subject, though very anxious to know her sentiments; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart, and sweet peculiarity of manner, that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself.
She is hurt, as you would be for William; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart.” “I knew she would be very angry with me.” “My dearest Fanny,” cried Edmund, pressing her arm closer to him, “do not let the idea of her anger distress you.
Her heart is made for love and kindness, not for resentment.
Do not turn away from me.” “I _should_ have thought,” said Fanny, after a pause of recollection and exertion, “that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man’s not being approved, not being loved by some one of her sex at least, let him be ever so generally agreeable.
How, then, was I to be—to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me?
And, and—we think very differently of the nature of women, if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply.” “My dear, dear Fanny, now I have the truth.
She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time, and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years’ happy marriage.” Fanny could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked for.
She must be used to the consideration of his being in love with her, and then a return of affection might not be very distant.
She immediately shook her head at Fanny with arch, yet affectionate reproach, and taking her hand, seemed hardly able to help beginning directly.
Fanny naturally turned upstairs, and took her guest to the apartment which was now always fit for comfortable use; opening the door, however, with a most aching heart, and feeling that she had a more distressing scene before her than ever that spot had yet witnessed.
‘When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state, matrimony may be called a happy life.’ I suppose no time can ever wear out the impression I have of his looks and voice as he said those words.
Nay, in sober sadness, I believe I now love you all.” And having said so, with a degree of tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in her before, and now thought only too becoming, she turned away for a moment to recover herself.
“I have had a little fit since I came into this room, as you may perceive,” said she presently, with a playful smile, “but it is over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable; for as to scolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending to do, I have not the heart for it when it comes to the point.” And embracing her very affectionately, “Good, gentle Fanny!
when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long, I feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you.” Fanny was affected.
She had not foreseen anything of this, and her feelings could seldom withstand the melancholy influence of the word “last.” She cried as if she had loved Miss Crawford more than she possibly could; and Miss Crawford, yet farther softened by the sight of such emotion, hung about her with fondness, and said, “I hate to leave you.
Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years.
For as to secrecy, Henry is quite the hero of an old romance, and glories in his chains.
If you were to see how he is courted, and how I am courted for his sake!
When she comes to know the truth she will, very likely, wish me in Northamptonshire again; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser, by a first wife, whom she is wild to get married, and wants Henry to take.
I wish Margaret were married, for my poor friend’s sake, for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people.
But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him, I should never have done.
You were as conscious as heart could desire.
He has now and then been a sad flirt, and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies’ affections.
But this I will say, that his fault, the liking to make girls a little in love with him, is not half so dangerous to a wife’s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself, which he has never been addicted to.
And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before; that he loves you with all his heart, and will love you as nearly for ever as possible.
If any man ever loved a woman for ever, I think Henry will do as much for you.” Fanny could not avoid a faint smile, but had nothing to say.
And I do take leave, longing for a happy reunion, and trusting that when we meet again, it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve.” A very, very kind embrace, and some agitation of manner, accompanied these words.
There was no resisting so much apparent affection.
Henry Crawford came and sat some time with them; and her spirits not being previously in the strongest state, her heart was softened for a while towards him, because he really seemed to feel.
If she could have believed Mary’s future fate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother’s should be, if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant as she was much inclined to think his, she would have been light of heart indeed; but the more she recollected and observed, the more deeply was she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for Miss Crawford’s marrying Edmund than it had ever been before.
His good and her bad feelings yielded to love, and such love must unite them.
He was to go to town as soon as some business relative to Thornton Lacey were completed—perhaps within a fortnight; he talked of going, he loved to talk of it; and when once with her again, Fanny could not doubt the rest.
She might love, but she did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment.
Fanny believed there was scarcely a second feeling in common between them; and she may be forgiven by older sages for looking on the chance of Miss Crawford’s future improvement as nearly desperate, for thinking that if Edmund’s influence in this season of love had already done so little in clearing her judgment, and regulating her notions, his worth would be finally wasted on her even in years of matrimony.
Experience might have hoped more for any young people so circumstanced, and impartiality would not have denied to Miss Crawford’s nature that participation of the general nature of women which would lead her to adopt the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own.
Sir Thomas, meanwhile, went on with his own hopes and his own observations, still feeling a right, by all his knowledge of human nature, to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and consequence on his niece’s spirits, and the past attentions of the lover producing a craving for their return; and he was soon afterwards able to account for his not yet completely and indubitably seeing all this, by the prospect of another visitor, whose approach he could allow to be quite enough to support the spirits he was watching.
To be in the centre of such a circle, loved by so many, and more loved by all than she had ever been before; to feel affection without fear or restraint; to feel herself the equal of those who surrounded her; to be at peace from all mention of the Crawfords, safe from every look which could be fancied a reproach on their account.
At a distance, unassailed by his looks or his kindness, and safe from the perpetual irritation of knowing his heart, and striving to avoid his confidence, she should be able to reason herself into a properer state; she should be able to think of him as in London, and arranging everything there, without wretchedness.
Fanny wrote to offer herself; and her mother’s answer, though short, was so kind—a few simple lines expressed so natural and motherly a joy in the prospect of seeing her child again, as to confirm all the daughter’s views of happiness in being with her—convincing her that she should now find a warm and affectionate friend in the “mama” who had certainly shewn no remarkable fondness for her formerly; but this she could easily suppose to have been her own fault or her own fancy.
She had probably alienated love by the helplessness and fretfulness of a fearful temper, or been unreasonable in wanting a larger share than any one among so many could deserve.
You will tell my mother how it all ought to be, and you will be so useful to Susan, and you will teach Betsey, and make the boys love and mind you.
Her heart was completely sad at parting.
She had tears for every room in the house, much more for every beloved inhabitant.
She clung to her aunt, because she would miss her; she kissed the hand of her uncle with struggling sobs, because she had displeased him; and as for Edmund, she could neither speak, nor look, nor think, when the last moment came with _him_; and it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving her the affectionate farewell of a brother.
William knew what had passed, and from his heart lamented that his sister’s feelings should be so cold towards a man whom he must consider as the first of human characters; but he was of an age to be all for love, and therefore unable to blame; and knowing her wish on the subject, he would not distress her by the slightest allusion.
Miss Crawford’s style of writing, lively and affectionate, was itself an evil, independent of what she was thus forced into reading from the brother’s pen, for Edmund would never rest till she had read the chief of the letter to him; and then she had to listen to his admiration of her language, and the warmth of her attachments.
There had, in fact, been so much of message, of allusion, of recollection, so much of Mansfield in every letter, that Fanny could not but suppose it meant for him to hear; and to find herself forced into a purpose of that kind, compelled into a correspondence which was bringing her the addresses of the man she did not love, and obliging her to administer to the adverse passion of the man she did, was cruelly mortifying.
And Mr. Campbell was here at four o’clock to ask for you: he has got one of the Thrush’s boats, and is going off to her at six, and hoped you would be here in time to go with him.” A stare or two at Fanny, as William helped her out of the carriage, was all the voluntary notice which this brother bestowed; but he made no objection to her kissing him, though still entirely engaged in detailing farther particulars of the Thrush’s going out of harbour, in which he had a strong right of interest, being to commence his career of seamanship in her at this very time.
Another moment and Fanny was in the narrow entrance-passage of the house, and in her mother’s arms, who met her there with looks of true kindness, and with features which Fanny loved the more, because they brought her aunt Bertram’s before her, and there were her two sisters: Susan, a well-grown fine girl of fourteen, and Betsey, the youngest of the family, about five—both glad to see her in their way, though with no advantage of manner in receiving her.
Would they but love her, she should be satisfied.
Come, mother, you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny yet.” In they both came, and Mrs. Price having kindly kissed her daughter again, and commented a little on her growth, began with very natural solicitude to feel for their fatigues and wants as travellers.
But here is my sister, sir; here is Fanny,” turning and leading her forward; “it is so dark you do not see her.” With an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her, Mr. Price now received his daughter; and having given her a cordial hug, and observed that she was grown into a woman, and he supposed would be wanting a husband soon, seemed very much inclined to forget her again.
Both were kissed very tenderly, but Tom she wanted to keep by her, to try to trace the features of the baby she had loved, and talked to, of his infant preference of herself.
Fanny’s spirit was as much refreshed as her body; her head and heart were soon the better for such well-timed kindness.
“What have you got there, my love?” said Fanny; “come and shew it to me.” It was a silver knife.
Mrs. Norris, however, had gone home and taken down two old prayer-books of her husband with that idea; but, upon examination, the ardour of generosity went off.
Everything in that quarter failed her, except William’s affection.
Mrs. Price was not unkind; but, instead of gaining on her affection and confidence, and becoming more and more dear, her daughter never met with greater kindness from her than on the first day of her arrival.
Her heart and her time were already quite full; she had neither leisure nor affection to bestow on Fanny.
These shared her heart: her time was given chiefly to her house and her servants.
Her disposition was naturally easy and indolent, like Lady Bertram’s; and a situation of similar affluence and do-nothingness would have been much more suited to her capacity than the exertions and self-denials of the one which her imprudent marriage had placed her in.
She might scruple to make use of the words, but she must and did feel that her mother was a partial, ill-judging parent, a dawdle, a slattern, who neither taught nor restrained her children, whose house was the scene of mismanagement and discomfort from beginning to end, and who had no talent, no conversation, no affection towards herself; no curiosity to know her better, no desire of her friendship, and no inclination for her company that could lessen her sense of such feelings.
Betsey, too, a spoiled child, trained up to think the alphabet her greatest enemy, left to be with the servants at her pleasure, and then encouraged to report any evil of them, she was almost as ready to despair of being able to love or assist; and of Susan’s temper she had many doubts.
On the contrary, she could think of nothing but Mansfield, its beloved inmates, its happy ways.
In her present exile from good society, and distance from everything that had been wont to interest her, a letter from one belonging to the set where her heart lived, written with affection, and some degree of elegance, was thoroughly acceptable.
The usual plea of increasing engagements was made in excuse for not having written to her earlier; “And now that I have begun,” she continued, “my letter will not be worth your reading, for there will be no little offering of love at the end, no three or four lines _passionnées_ from the most devoted H. C. in the world, for Henry is in Norfolk; business called him to Everingham ten days ago, or perhaps he only pretended the call, for the sake of being travelling at the same time that you were.
There was no gratitude for affection past or present to make her better bear with its excesses to the others.
The deed thoroughly answered: a source of domestic altercation was entirely done away, and it was the means of opening Susan’s heart to her, and giving her something more to love and be interested in.
She acknowledged her fears, blamed herself for having contended so warmly; and from that hour Fanny, understanding the worth of her disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined to seek her good opinion and refer to her judgment, began to feel again the blessing of affection, and to entertain the hope of being useful to a mind so much in need of help, and so much deserving it.
They talked of William, a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire; and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart could wish.
By the time he had given all this information, it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye, and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London; that she had sent her best and kindest love, but had had no time for writing; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour, having spent scarcely twenty-four hours in London, after his return from Norfolk, before he set off again; that her cousin Edmund was in town, had been in town, he understood, a few days; that he had not seen him himself, but that he was well, had left them all well at Mansfield, and was to dine, as yesterday, with the Frasers.
He must soon give her up, and cease to have the smallest inclination for the match; and yet, though she had been so much wanting his affection to be cured, this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as the complaint; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever, agreeable man, than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations.
Now so long divided from everybody who knew the place, she felt it quite the voice of a friend when he mentioned it, and led the way to her fond exclamations in praise of its beauties and comforts, and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed her to gratify her own heart in the warmest eulogium, in speaking of her uncle as all that was clever and good, and her aunt as having the sweetest of all sweet tempers.
It often grieved her to the heart to think of the contrast between them; to think that where nature had made so little difference, circumstances should have made so much, and that her mother, as handsome as Lady Bertram, and some years her junior, should have an appearance so much more worn and faded, so comfortless, so slatternly, so shabby.
Good-bye; I wish you a pleasant journey to-morrow.” “Is there nothing I can do for you in town?” “Nothing; I am much obliged to you.” “Have you no message for anybody?” “My love to your sister, if you please; and when you see my cousin, my cousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him.” “Certainly; and if he is lazy or negligent, I will write his excuses myself.” He could say no more, for Fanny would be no longer detained.
He makes me write, but I do not know what else is to be communicated, except this said visit to Portsmouth, and these two said walks, and his introduction to your family, especially to a fair sister of yours, a fine girl of fifteen, who was of the party on the ramparts, taking her first lesson, I presume, in love.
She would try to be more ambitious than her heart would allow.
Susan, who had an innate taste for the genteel and well-appointed, was eager to hear, and Fanny could not but indulge herself in dwelling on so beloved a theme.
As she opened, and saw its length, she prepared herself for a minute detail of happiness and a profusion of love and praise towards the fortunate creature who was now mistress of his fate.
There is something soothing in the idea that we have the same friend, and that whatever unhappy differences of opinion may exist between us, we are united in our love of you.
She is a cold-hearted, vain woman, who has married entirely from convenience, and though evidently unhappy in her marriage, places her disappointment not to faults of judgment, or temper, or disproportion of age, but to her being, after all, less affluent than many of her acquaintance, especially than her sister, Lady Stornaway, and is the determined supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious, provided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough.
Could she be detached from them!—and sometimes I do not despair of it, for the affection appears to me principally on their side.
They are very fond of her; but I am sure she does not love them as she loves you.
That would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices, which, in fact, I am scarcely justified in asking; and, if I am refused, that, I think, will be the honest motive.
Were it a decided thing, an actual refusal, I hope I should know how to bear it, and how to endeavour to weaken her hold on my heart, and in the course of a few years—but I am writing nonsense.
My mother desires her best love, and hopes to hear from you soon.
I have little heart for extensive improvements till I know that it will ever have a mistress.
He will marry her, and be poor and miserable.
She loves nobody but herself and her brother.
Accepted or refused, his heart is wedded to her for ever.
For though Lady Bertram rather shone in the epistolary line, having early in her marriage, from the want of other employment, and the circumstance of Sir Thomas’s being in Parliament, got into the way of making and keeping correspondents, and formed for herself a very creditable, common-place, amplifying style, so that a very little matter was enough for her: she could not do entirely without any; she must have something to write about, even to her niece; and being so soon to lose all the benefit of Dr. Grant’s gouty symptoms and Mrs. Grant’s morning calls, it was very hard upon her to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she could put them to.
She could just find selfishness enough to wonder whether Edmund _had_ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came, but no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate and disinterestedly anxious.
Without any particular affection for her eldest cousin, her tenderness of heart made her feel that she could not spare him, and the purity of her principles added yet a keener solicitude, when she considered how little useful, how little self-denying his life had (apparently) been.
The end of April was coming on; it would soon be almost three months, instead of two, that she had been absent from them all, and that her days had been passing in a state of penance, which she loved them too well to hope they would thoroughly understand; and who could yet say when there might be leisure to think of or fetch her?
When she had been coming to Portsmouth, she had loved to call it her home, had been fond of saying that she was going home; the word had been very dear to her, and so it still was, but it must be applied to Mansfield.
She loved to fancy how she could have read to her aunt, how she could have talked to her, and tried at once to make her feel the blessing of what was, and prepare her mind for what might be; and how many walks up and down stairs she might have saved her, and how many messages she might have carried.
With real affection, Fanny, like mine, more might be overlooked.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>To have him still the acquaintance, the flirt perhaps, of Mrs. Rushworth!
She had begun to think he really loved her, and to fancy his affection for her something more than common; and his sister still said that he cared for nobody else.
A little flogging for man and woman too would be the best way of preventing such things.” Fanny read to herself that “it was with infinite concern the newspaper had to announce to the world a matrimonial _fracas_ in the family of Mr. R. of Wimpole Street; the beautiful Mrs. R., whose name had not long been enrolled in the lists of Hymen, and who had promised to become so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world, having quitted her husband’s roof in company with the well-known and captivating Mr. C., the intimate friend and associate of Mr. R., and it was not known even to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone.” “It is a mistake, sir,” said Fanny instantly; “it must be a mistake, it cannot be true; it must mean some other people.” She spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame; she spoke with a resolution which sprung from despair, for she spoke what she did not, could not believe herself.
The event was so shocking, that there were moments even when her heart revolted from it as impossible: when she thought it could not be.
A woman married only six months ago; a man professing himself devoted, even _engaged_ to another; that other her near relation; the whole family, both families connected as they were by tie upon tie; all friends, all intimate together!
To be going so soon, sent for so kindly, sent for as a comfort, and with leave to take Susan, was altogether such a combination of blessings as set her heart in a glow, and for a time seemed to distance every pain, and make her incapable of suitably sharing the distress even of those whose distress she thought of most.
Mrs. Price talked of her poor sister for a few minutes, but how to find anything to hold Susan’s clothes, because Rebecca took away all the boxes and spoilt them, was much more in her thoughts: and as for Susan, now unexpectedly gratified in the first wish of her heart, and knowing nothing personally of those who had sinned, or of those who were sorrowing—if she could help rejoicing from beginning to end, it was as much as ought to be expected from human virtue at fourteen.
He was alone, and met her instantly; and she found herself pressed to his heart with only these words, just articulate, “My Fanny, my only sister; my only comfort now!” She could say nothing; nor for some minutes could he say more.
How her heart swelled with joy and gratitude as she passed the barriers of Portsmouth, and how Susan’s face wore its broadest smiles, may be easily conceived.
Had he been alone with her, his heart must have opened in spite of every resolution; but Susan’s presence drove him quite into himself, and his attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never be long supported.
Fanny watched him with never-failing solicitude, and sometimes catching his eye, revived an affectionate smile, which comforted her; but the first day’s journey passed without her hearing a word from him on the subjects that were weighing him down.
How a man who had once loved, could desert you!
They were in the environs of Mansfield long before the usual dinner-time, and as they approached the beloved place, the hearts of both sisters sank a little.
Maria was her first favourite, the dearest of all; the match had been her own contriving, as she had been wont with such pride of heart to feel and say, and this conclusion of it almost overpowered her.
Lady Bertram could not give her much time, or many words, but she felt her, as Fanny’s sister, to have a claim at Mansfield, and was ready to kiss and like her; and Susan was more than satisfied, for she came perfectly aware that nothing but ill-humour was to be expected from aunt Norris; and was so provided with happiness, so strong in that best of blessings, an escape from many certain evils, that she could have stood against a great deal more indifference than she met with from the others.
Mrs. Rushworth had gone, for the Easter holidays, to Twickenham, with a family whom she had just grown intimate with: a family of lively, agreeable manners, and probably of morals and discretion to suit, for to _their_ house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times.
Every other child must be racking his heart.
Sitting with her on Sunday evening—a wet Sunday evening—the very time of all others when, if a friend is at hand, the heart must be opened, and everything told; no one else in the room, except his mother, who, after hearing an affecting sermon, had cried herself to sleep, it was impossible not to speak; and so, with the usual beginnings, hardly to be traced as to what came first, and the usual declaration that if she would listen to him for a few minutes, he should be very brief, and certainly never tax her kindness in the same way again; she need not fear a repetition; it would be a subject prohibited entirely: he entered upon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the first interest to himself, to one of whose affectionate sympathy he was quite convinced.
She reprobated her brother’s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for, to do what must lose him the woman he adored; but still more the folly of poor Maria, in sacrificing such a situation, plunging into such difficulties, under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear.
“We were all disposed to wonder, but it seems to have been the merciful appointment of Providence that the heart which knew no guile should not suffer.
She spoke of you with high praise and warm affection; yet, even here, there was alloy, a dash of evil; for in the midst of it she could exclaim, ‘Why would not she have him?
Had she accepted him as she ought, they might now have been on the point of marriage, and Henry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object.
It would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation, in yearly meetings at Sotherton and Everingham.’ Could you have believed it possible?
Well, she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them.
“‘We must persuade Henry to marry her,’ said she; ‘and what with honour, and the certainty of having shut himself out for ever from Fanny, I do not despair of it.
My influence, which is not small shall all go that way; and when once married, and properly supported by her own family, people of respectability as they are, she may recover her footing in society to a certain degree.
If by any officious exertions of his, she is induced to leave Henry’s protection, there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him.
That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister (with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say), but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself, giving it every reproach but the right; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong; and last of all, and above all, recommending to us a compliance, a compromise, an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin, on the chance of a marriage which, thinking as I now thought of her brother, should rather be prevented than sought; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before, and that, as far as related to mind, it had been the creature of my own imagination, not Miss Crawford, that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past.
I only said in reply, that from my heart I wished her well, and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly, and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire, the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty, to the lessons of affliction, and immediately left the room.
She was returned to Mansfield Park, she was useful, she was beloved; she was safe from Mr. Crawford; and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits, of his perfect approbation and increased regard; and happy as all this must make her, she would still have been happy without any of it, for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford.
He felt that he ought not to have allowed the marriage; that his daughter’s sentiments had been sufficiently known to him to render him culpable in authorising it; that in so doing he had sacrificed the right to the expedient, and been governed by motives of selfishness and worldly wisdom.
He saw how ill he had judged, in expecting to counteract what was wrong in Mrs. Norris by its reverse in himself; clearly saw that he had but increased the evil by teaching them to repress their spirits in his presence so as to make their real disposition unknown to him, and sending them for all their indulgences to a person who had been able to attach them only by the blindness of her affection, and the excess of her praise.
She hoped to marry him, and they continued together till she was obliged to be convinced that such hope was vain, and till the disappointment and wretchedness arising from the conviction rendered her temper so bad, and her feelings for him so like hatred, as to make them for a while each other’s punishment, and then induce a voluntary separation.
Mr. Rushworth had no difficulty in procuring a divorce; and so ended a marriage contracted under such circumstances as to make any better end the effect of good luck not to be reckoned on.
She had despised him, and loved another; and he had been very much aware that it was so.
It ended in Mrs. Norris’s resolving to quit Mansfield and devote herself to her unfortunate Maria, and in an establishment being formed for them in another country, remote and private, where, shut up together with little society, on one side no affection, on the other no judgment, it may be reasonably supposed that their tempers became their mutual punishment.
She had never been able to attach even those she loved best; and since Mrs. Rushworth’s elopement, her temper had been in a state of such irritation as to make her everywhere tormenting.
His affection had already done something.
Would he have deserved more, there can be no doubt that more would have been obtained, especially when that marriage had taken place, which would have given him the assistance of her conscience in subduing her first inclination, and brought them very often together.
Would he have persevered, and uprightly, Fanny must have been his reward, and a reward very voluntarily bestowed, within a reasonable period from Edmund’s marrying Mary.
In this spirit he began the attack, and by animated perseverance had soon re-established the sort of familiar intercourse, of gallantry, of flirtation, which bounded his views; but in triumphing over the discretion which, though beginning in anger, might have saved them both, he had put himself in the power of feelings on her side more strong than he had supposed.
She loved him; there was no withdrawing attentions avowedly dear to her.
He was entangled by his own vanity, with as little excuse of love as possible, and without the smallest inconstancy of mind towards her cousin.
In this world the penalty is less equal than could be wished; but without presuming to look forward to a juster appointment hereafter, we may fairly consider a man of sense, like Henry Crawford, to be providing for himself no small portion of vexation and regret: vexation that must rise sometimes to self-reproach, and regret to wretchedness, in having so requited hospitality, so injured family peace, so forfeited his best, most estimable, and endeared acquaintance, and so lost the woman whom he had rationally as well as passionately loved.
Mrs. Grant, with a temper to love and be loved, must have gone with some regret from the scenes and people she had been used to; but the same happiness of disposition must in any place, and any society, secure her a great deal to enjoy, and she had again a home to offer Mary; and Mary had had enough of her own friends, enough of vanity, ambition, love, and disappointment in the course of the last half-year, to be in need of the true kindness of her sister’s heart, and the rational tranquillity of her ways.
Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford, and observing to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such another woman, before it began to strike him whether a very different kind of woman might not do just as well, or a great deal better: whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear, as important to him in all her smiles and all her ways, as Mary Crawford had ever been; and whether it might not be a possible, a hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love.
I only entreat everybody to believe that exactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so, and not a week earlier, Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, and became as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire.
Even in the midst of his late infatuation, he had acknowledged Fanny’s mental superiority.
His happiness in knowing himself to have been so long the beloved of such a heart, must have been great enough to warrant any strength of language in which he could clothe it to her or to himself; it must have been a delightful happiness.
Let no one presume to give the feelings of a young woman on receiving the assurance of that affection of which she has scarcely allowed herself to entertain a hope.
He might have made her childhood happier; but it had been an error of judgment only which had given him the appearance of harshness, and deprived him of her early love; and now, on really knowing each other, their mutual attachment became very strong.
No happiness of son or niece could make her wish the marriage.
With quickness in understanding the tempers of those she had to deal with, and no natural timidity to restrain any consequent wishes, she was soon welcome and useful to all; and after Fanny’s removal succeeded so naturally to her influence over the hourly comfort of her aunt, as gradually to become, perhaps, the most beloved of the two.
With so much true merit and true love, and no want of fortune and friends, the happiness of the married cousins must appear as secure as earthly happiness can be.
Equally formed for domestic life, and attached to country pleasures, their home was the home of affection and comfort; and to complete the picture of good, the acquisition of Mansfield living, by the death of Dr. Grant, occurred just after they had been married long enough to begin to want an increase of income, and feel their distance from the paternal abode an inconvenience.
On that event they removed to Mansfield; and the Parsonage there, which, under each of its two former owners, Fanny had never been able to approach but with some painful sensation of restraint or alarm, soon grew as dear to her heart, and as thoroughly perfect in her eyes, as everything else within the view and patronage of Mansfield Park had long been.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The poor woman returning, and beholding this dreadful sight, shrieked aloud, and fled into the woods, where, as described in the romance, she roamed a raving maniac, and for some time secreted herself from all living society.
[I embrace the opportunity given me by a second mention of this tribe, to notice an error, which imputes to an individual named Ciar Mohr MacGregor, the slaughter of the students at the battle of Glenfruin.
His temper was moody, fierce, and irascible; yet he must have had some ostensible good qualities, as he was greatly beloved by Lord Kilpont, the eldest son of the Earl of Airth and Menteith.
At that time, Stewart of Ardvoirlich shared the confidence of the young Lord by day, and his bed by night, when, about four or five days after the battle, Ardvoirlich, either from a fit of sudden fury or deep malice long entertained against his unsuspecting friend, stabbed Lord Kilpont to the heart, and escaped from the camp of Montrose, having killed a sentinel who attempted to detain him.
He came--he revisited the loved scene; it was but a sterile glen, surrounded with rude crags, and traversed by a northern torrent.
Scotland had as yet remained free from the ravages of intestine war, although its inhabitants were much divided in political opinions; and many of them, tired of the control of the Estates of Parliament, and disapproving of the bold measure which they had adopted, by sending into England a large army to the assistance of the Parliament, were determined on their part to embrace the earliest opportunity of declaring for the King, and making such a diversion as should at least compel the recall of General Leslie’s army out of England, if it did not recover a great part of Scotland to the King’s allegiance.
They considered, however, with satisfaction, that no leader or name of consequence had as yet appeared to assemble an army of royalists, or even to direct the efforts of those desultory bands, whom love of plunder, perhaps, as much as political principle, had hurried into measures of hostility.
In the present times, a scene so romantic would have been judged to possess the highest charms for the traveller; but those who journey in days of doubt and dread, pay little attention to picturesque scenery.
And hearing at this time, to my exceeding satisfaction, that there is something to be doing this summer in my way in this my dear native country, I am come hither, as they say, like a beggar to a bridal, in order to give my loving countrymen the advantage of that experience which I have acquired in foreign parts.
“I should have thought,” said he to Captain Dalgetty, “that a cavalier of your honourable mark, who hath so long followed the valiant King of Sweden, and entertains such a suitable contempt for the base mechanical States of Holland, would not have hesitated to embrace the cause of King Charles, in preference to that of the low-born, roundheaded, canting knaves, who are in rebellion against his authority?” “Ye speak reasonably, my lord,” said Dalgetty, “and, CAETERIS PARIBUS, I might be induced to see the matter in the same light.
I will not deny them to be a people stout in body and valiant in heart, and courageous enough in their own wild way of fighting, which is as remote from the usages and discipline of war as ever was that of the ancient Scythians, or of the salvage Indians of America that now is, They havena sae mickle as a German whistle, or a drum, to beat a march, an alarm, a charge, a retreat, a reveille, or the tattoo, or any other point of war; and their damnable skirlin’ pipes, whilk they themselves pretend to understand, are unintelligible to the ears of any cavaliero accustomed to civilised warfare.
Wherefore these valiant Irishes, being all put to the sword, as is usual in such cases, did nevertheless gain immortal praise and honour; so that, for their sakes, I have always loved and honoured those of that nation next to my own country of Scotland.” “A command of Irish,” said Menteith, “I think I could almost promise you, should you be disposed to embrace the royal cause.” “And yet,” said Captain Dalgetty, “my second and greatest difficulty remains behind; for, although I hold it a mean and sordid thing for a soldado to have nothing in his mouth but pay and gelt, like the base cullions, the German lanz-knechts, whom I mentioned before; and although I will maintain it with my sword, that honour is to be preferred before pay, free quarters, and arrears, yet, EX CONTRARIO, a soldier’s pay being the counterpart of his engagement of service, it becomes a wise and considerate cavalier to consider what remuneration he is to receive for his service, and from what funds it is to be paid.
When the travellers were admitted into the court, they found additional preparations for defence.
By living in this manner, the boy had gotten a timid, wild, startled look, loved to seek out solitary places in the woods, and was never so much terrified, as by the approach of children of the same age.
They who had hitherto held him in contempt, now feared, if they did not love him; and, instead of Allan’s being esteemed a dreaming, womanish, and feeble-minded boy, those who encountered him in sports or military exercise, now complained that, when heated by the strife, he was too apt to turn game into earnest, and to forget that he was only engaged in a friendly trial of strength.--But I speak to regardless ears,” said Lord Menteith, interrupting himself, for the Captain’s nose now gave the most indisputable signs that he was fast locked in the arms of oblivion.
pooh!” said Lord Menteith, laughing, yet blushing at the same time; “Allan is not accessible to the passion of love; and for myself,” said he, more gravely; “Annot’s unknown birth is a sufficient reason against serious designs, and her unprotected state precludes every other.” “It is spoken like yourself, my lord,” said Anderson.--“But I trust you will proceed with your interesting story.” “It is wellnigh finished,” said Lord Menteith; “I have only to add, that from the great strength and courage of Allan M’Aulay, from his energetic and uncontrollable disposition, and from an opinion generally entertained and encouraged by himself that he holds communion with supernatural beings, and can predict future events, the clan pay a much greater degree of deference to him than even to his brother, who is a bold-hearted rattling Highlander, but with nothing which can possibly rival the extraordinary character of his younger brother.” “Such a character,” said Anderson, “cannot but have the deepest effect on the minds of a Highland host.
It is fearful to see a mind, naturally generous and affectionate, afflicted by this constitutional malady.” As she spoke in a low and confidential tone, Lord Menteith naturally drew close, and stooped forward, that he might the better catch the sense of what she said.
It was the mourning ring worn by my mother in memorial of her murdered brother.” “I fear no omens,” said Annot, smiling through her tears; “and nothing coming through the hands of my two patrons,” so she was wont to call Lord Menteith and Allan, “can bring bad luck to the poor orphan.” She put the ring on her finger, and, turning to her harp, sung, to a lively air, the following verses of one of the fashionable songs of the period, which had found its way, marked as it was with the quaint hyperbolical taste of King Charles’s time, from some court masque to the wilds of Perthshire:-- “Gaze not upon the stars, fond sage, In them no influence lies; To read the fate of youth or age, Look on my Helen’s eyes.
It only remained,” he said, “that the noble Chiefs assembled, laying aside every lesser consideration, should unite, heart and hand, in the common cause; send the fiery cross through their clans, in order to collect their utmost force, and form their junction with such celerity as to leave the enemy no time, either for preparation, or recovery from the panic which would spread at the first sound of their pibroch.
Those who knew Allan’s prophetic pretensions, smiled mysteriously; but he himself only replied, that “the Earl of Montrose need not be surprised if he was known to thousands, of whom he himself could retain no memory.” “By the honour of a cavalier,” said Captain Dalgetty, finding at length an opportunity to thrust in his word, “I am proud and happy in having an opportunity of drawing a sword under your lordship’s command; and I do forgive all grudge, malecontent, and malice of my heart, to Mr. Allan M’Aulay, for having thrust me down to the lowest seat of the board yestreen.
“I love Sir Duncan Campbell; we have been joint sufferers in former days, and I do not forget it now.” “My Lord of Menteith,” said Sir Duncan Campbell, “I am grieved to see you, at your early age, engaged in such desperate and rebellious courses.” “I am young,” answered Menteith, “yet old enough to distinguish between right and wrong, between loyalty and rebellion; and the sooner a good course is begun, the longer and the better have I a chance of running it.” “And you too, my friend, Allan M’Aulay,” said Sir Duncan, taking his hand, “must we also call each other enemies, that have been so often allied against a common foe?” Then turning round to the meeting, he said, “Farewell, gentlemen; there are so many of you to whom I wish well, that your rejection of all terms of mediation gives me deep affliction.
After this interchange of greeting, the steed began to his provender with an eager dispatch, which showed old military habits; and the master, after looking on the animal with great complacency for about five minutes, said,--“Much good may it do your honest heart, Gustavus;--now must I go and lay in provant myself for the campaign.” He then departed, having first saluted the Englishman and Angus M’Aulay, who remained looking at each other for some time in silence, and then burst out into a fit of laughter.
“It grieved him to the very heart,” he said, “to see that friends and neighbours, who should stand shoulder to shoulder, were likely to be engaged hand to hand in a cause which so little concerned them.
Bridget sent no scaly spoil;-- An infant, wellnigh dead, They saved, and rear’d in want and toil, To beg from you her bread.” That orphan maid the lady kiss’d-- “My husband’s looks you bear; St. Bridget and her morn be bless’d!
The withered leaves fell around her, and her heart was more withered than they.
I must go to see what they are to make of him.” He had no sooner reached, however, the court to the seaward, and put himself in the act of descending the staircase, than two Highland sentinels, advancing their Lochaber axes, gave him to understand that this was a service of danger.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>He might have marked, on the soft and gentle slope that ascends from the shores, the noble old Gothic castle, with its varied outline, embattled walls, towers, and outer and inner courts, which, so far as the picturesque is concerned, presented an aspect much more striking than the present massive and uniform mansion.
The boat soon approached the rugged pier, which abutted into the loch from the little town of Inverary, then a rude assemblage of huts, with a very few stone mansions interspersed, stretching upwards from the banks of Loch Fine to the principal gate of the castle, before which a scene presented itself that might easily have quelled a less stout heart, and turned a more delicate stomach, than those of Ritt-master Dugald Dalgetty, titular of Drumthwacket.
He was adored by his own clan, whose advancement he had greatly studied, although he was in proportion disliked by the Highlanders of other septs, some of whom he had already stripped of their possessions, while others conceived themselves in danger from his future schemes, and all dreaded the height to which he was elevated.
But, Ranald, since that is your name, how came you in possession of the provost’s court of guard?
The owl whooped around us as we hung betwixt heaven and earth; the tide roared against the foot of the rock, and dashed asunder our skiff, yet no man’s heart failed him.
O, I know it by my own heart?
Does not the valley of Glenorquhy, to this very hour, cry shame on the violence offered to a helpless infant whom her kinsmen were conveying to the court of the Sovereign?
“And now, Ranald,” said Dalgetty, “strip thy upper garment--thy plaid I mean, Ranald, and in it will I muffle the M’Callum More, and make of him, for the time, a Child of the Mist;--Nay, I must bring it over your head, my lord, so as to secure us against your mistimed clamour.--So, now he is sufficiently muffled;--hold down your hands, or, by Heaven, I will stab you to the heart with your own dagger!--nay, you shall be bound with nothing less than silk, as your quality deserves.--So, now he is secure till some one comes to relieve him.
Ranald spoke anxiously and hastily to the children of his tribe, and the men came one by one to shake hands with Dalgetty, while the women, clamorous in their gratitude, pressed round to kiss even the hem of his garment.
“They plight their faith to you,” said Ranald MacEagh, “for requital of the good deed you have done to the tribe this day.” “Enough said, Ranald,” answered the soldier, “enough said--tell them I love not this shaking of hands--it confuses ranks and degrees in military service; and as to kissing of gauntlets, puldrons, and the like, I remember that the immortal Gustavus, as he rode through the streets of Nuremberg, being thus worshipped by the poulace (being doubtless far more worthy of it than a poor though honourable cavalier like myself), did say unto them, in the way of rebuke, ‘If you idolize me thus like a god, who shall assure you that the vengeance of Heaven will not soon prove me to be a mortal?’--And so here, I suppose you intend to make a stand against your followers, Ranald--VOTO A DIOS, as the Spaniard says?--a very pretty position--as pretty a position for a small peloton of men as I have seen in my service--no enemy can come towards it by the road without being at the mercy of cannon and musket.--But then, Ranald, my trusty comrade, you have no cannon, I dare to aver, and I do not see that any of these fellows have muskets either.
Neither did they strike kettle-drums again at the head of that famous regiment until they behaved themselves so notably at the field of Leipsic; a lesson whilk is not to be forgotten, any more than that exclamation of the immortal Gustavus, ‘Now shall I know if my officers love me, by their putting on their armour; since, if my officers are slain, who shall lead my soldiers into victory?’ Nevertheless, friend Ranald, this is without prejudice to my being rid of these somewhat heavy boots, providing I can obtain any other succedaneum; for I presume not to say that my bare soles are fortified so as to endure the flints and thorns, as seems to be the case with your followers.” To rid the Captain of his cumbrous greaves, and case his feet in a pair of brogues made out of deerskin, which a Highlander stripped off for his accommodation, was the work of a minute, and Dalgetty found himself much lightened by the exchange.
I’ll serve thee in such noble ways As ne’er were known before; I’ll deck and crown thy head with bays, And love thee more and more.--MONTROSE’S LINES.
But he courted sleep in vain, for the visions of ambition excluded those of Morpheus.
But my escape is, under Heaven, and the excellent dexterity which, as an old and accomplished cavalier, I displayed in effecting the same,--I say, under these, it is owing to the assistance of this old Highlander, whom I venture to recommend to your lordship’s special favour, as the instrument of saving your lordship’s to command, Dugald Dalgetty of Drumthwacket.” “A thankworthy service,” said the Marquis, gravely, “which shall certainly be requited in the manner it deserves.” “Kneel down, Ranald,” said Major Dalgetty (as we must now call him), “kneel down, and kiss his Excellency’s hand.” The prescribed form of acknowledgment not being according to the custom of Ranald’s country, he contented himself with folding his arms on his bosom, and making a low inclination of his head.
Let him retire to the court of guard, and we will think of the best mode of protecting him.” “You hear, Ranald,” said Major Dalgetty, with an air of superiority, “his Excellency wishes to hold privy council with me, you must go to the court of guard.--He does not know where that is, poor fellow!--he is a young soldier for so old a man; I will put him under the charge of a sentinel, and return to your lordship incontinent.” He did so, and returned accordingly.
For you, Major, my groom of the chambers will be your quarter-master for this evening.” Major Dalgetty took his leave with a joyful heart greatly elated with the reception he had met with, and much pleased with the personal manners of his new General, which, as he explained at great length to Ranald MacEagh, reminded him in many respects of the demeanour of the immortal Gustavus Adolphus, the Lion of the North, and Bulwark of the Protestant Faith.
Were I to read the record in the eternal book of fate, I would declare it impossible--we are bound by the ties of blood, and by a hundred ties more intimate--we have stood side by side in battle, and our swords have reeked with the blood of the same enemies--it is IMPOSSIBLE I should harm him!” “That you WILL do so,” answered Ranald, “is certain, though the cause be hid in the darkness of futurity.
soon shall your murderers’ swords be dyed in each other’s blood.” On the succeeding morning all was prepared, and Montrose advanced by rapid marches up the river Tay, and poured his desultory forces into the romantic vale around the lake of the same name, which lies at the head of that river.
Their natural love of war, their zeal for the royal cause,--for they viewed the King in the light of a chief whom his clansmen had deserted,--as well as their implicit obedience to their own patriarch, drew in to Montrose’s army not only all in the neighbourhood who were able to bear arms, but some who, in age at least, might have been esteemed past the use of them.
I love not the payment of such debts by third hands.” “You are too scrupulous,” said Argyle; “what signifies it by whose hands the blood of the Grahames is spilt?
There were feelings in his bosom which could not be expressed; for the character of a Chief was that of a father, and the heart of a clansman durst not dwell upon his failings with critical severity as upon those of other men.
Argyle, too, harsh and severe to others, was generous and liberal among his kinsmen, and the noble heart of, Ardenvohr was wrung with bitter anguish, when he reflected to what interpretation his present conduct might subject him.
Yonder goes Sir Duncan Campbell, riding a brown bay gelding, which I had marked for my own second charger.” “You are wrong, Major,” said Montrose, with a bitter smile, “they are saving their precious Chief--Give the signal for assault instantly--send the word through the ranks.--Gentlemen, noble Chiefs, Glengarry, Keppoch, M’Vourigh, upon them instantly!--Ride to M’Ilduy, Major Dalgetty, and tell him to charge as he loves Lochaber--return and bring our handful of horse to my standard.
Sir Duncan’s reply was the discharge of a reserved pistol, which took effect not on the person of the rider, but on that of his gallant horse, which, shot through the heart, fell dead under him.
Montrose dearly loved his noble kinsman, in whom there was conspicuous a flash of the generous, romantic, disinterested chivalry of the old heroic times, entirely different from the sordid, calculating, and selfish character, which the practice of entertaining mercenary troops had introduced into most parts of Europe, and of which degeneracy Scotland, which furnished soldiers of fortune for the service of almost every nation, had been contaminated with a more than usual share.
But as it is the intercourse of private life that formeth the social character, so I do not apprehend that of the single soldier to be much polished by the conversation of the corporal or the sergeant, or that of Loyalty’s Reward to have been much dulcified, or ameliorated, by the society of his Excellency’s grooms, who bestow more oaths, and kicks, and thumps, than kindness or caresses, upon the animals intrusted to their charge; whereby many a generous quadruped, rendered as it were misanthropic, manifests during the rest of his life a greater desire to kick and bite his master, than to love and to honour him.” “Spoken like an oracle,” said Montrose.
“Were there an academy for the education of horses to be annexed to the Mareschal-College of Aberdeen, Sir Dugald Dalgetty alone should fill the chair.” “Because, being an ass,” said Menteith, aside to the General, “there would be some distant relation between the professor and the students.” “And now, with your Excellency’s permission,” said the new-made knight, “I am going to pay my last visit to the remains of my old companion in arms.” “Not with the purpose of going through the ceremonial of interment?” said the Marquis, who did not know how far Sir Dugald’s enthusiasm might lead him; “consider our brave fellows themselves will have but a hasty burial.” “Your Excellency will pardon me,” said Dalgetty; “my purpose is less romantic.
I go to divide poor Gustavus’s legacy with the fowls of heaven, leaving the flesh to them, and reserving to myself his hide; which, in token of affectionate remembrance, I purpose to form into a cassock and trowsers, after the Tartar fashion, to be worn under my armour, in respect my nether garments are at present shamefully the worse of the wear.--Alas!
This poor girl is exquisitely beautiful, and has talents formed to captivate your romantic temper.
You cannot think of injuring her--you cannot think of marrying her?” “My lord,” replied Menteith, “you have repeatedly urged this jest, for so I trust it is meant, somewhat beyond bounds.
Annot Lyle is of unknown birth,--a captive,--the daughter, probably, of some obscure outlaw; a dependant on the hospitality of the M’Aulays.” “Do not be angry, Menteith,” said the Marquis, interrupting him; “you love the classics, though not educated at Mareschal-College; and you may remember how many gallant hearts captive beauty has subdued:-- Movit Ajacem, Telamone natum, Forma captivae dominum Tecmessae.
“And, like true champions in romance,” he said, “you have agreed, that you are both to worship the same mistress, as idolaters do the same image, and that neither shall extend his pretensions farther?” “I did not go so far, my lord,” answered Menteith--“I only said in the present circumstances--and there is no prospect of their being changed,--I could, in duty to myself and family, stand in no relation to Annot Lyle, but as that of friend or brother--But your lordship must excuse me; I have,” said he, looking at his arm, round which he had tied his handkerchief, “a slight hurt to attend to.” “A wound?” said Montrose, anxiously; “let me see it.--Alas!” he said, “I should have heard nothing of this, had I not ventured to tent and sound another more secret and more rankling one, Menteith; I am sorry for you--I too have known--But what avails it to awake sorrows which have long slumbered!” So saying, he shook hands with his noble kinsman, and walked into the castle.
“It is hideous!” said Annot, covering her eyes with her hands; “how can you bid me look upon it?” “You must be inured to it,” said he, “if you remain with this destined host--you will soon have to search such a field for my brother’s corpse--for Menteith’s--for mine---but that will be a more indifferent task--You do not love me!” “This is the first time you have taxed me with unkindness,” said Annot, weeping.
“You are my brother--my preserver--my protector--and can I then BUT love you?--But your hour of darkness is approaching, let me fetch my harp--” “Remain,” said Allan, still holding her fast; “be my visions from heaven or hell, or from the middle sphere of disembodied spirits--or be they, as the Saxons hold, but the delusions of an over-heated fancy, they do not now influence me; I speak the language of the natural, of the visible world.--You love not me, Annot--you love Menteith--by him you are beloved again, and Allan is no more to you than one of the corpses which encumber yonder heath.” It cannot be supposed that this strange speech conveyed any new information to her who was thus addressed.
No woman ever lived who could not, in the same circumstances, have discerned long since the state of her lover’s mind.
You know who and what I am, and how impossible it is that Menteith or you can use language of affection to me, beyond that of friendship.
You know from what unhappy race I have too probably derived my existence.” “I will not believe it,” said Allan, impetuously; “never flowed crystal drop from a polluted spring.” “Yet the very doubt,” pleaded Annot, “should make you forbear to use this language to me.” “I know,” said M’Aulay, “it places a bar between us--but I know also that it divides you not so inseparably from Menteith.--Hear me, my beloved Annot!--leave this scene of terrors and danger--go with me to Kintail--I will place you in the house of the noble Lady of Seaforth--or you shall be removed in safety to Icolmkill, where some women yet devote themselves to the worship of God, after the custom of our ancestors.” “You consider not what you ask of me,” replied Annot; “to undertake such a journey under your sole guardianship, were to show me less scrupulous than maiden ought.
--After you’re gone, I grew acquainted with my heart, and search’d, What stirr’d it so.--Alas!
I found it love.
Annot Lyle had now to contemplate the terrible gulf which Allan M’Aulay’s declaration of love and jealousy had made to open around her.
She had long been conscious that she loved Menteith dearer than a brother; indeed, how could it be otherwise, considering their early intimacy, the personal merit of the young nobleman, his assiduous attentions,--and his infinite superiority in gentleness of disposition, and grace of manners, over the race of rude warriors with whom she lived?
But her affection was of that quiet, timid, meditative character, which sought rather a reflected share in the happiness of the beloved object, than formed more presumptuous or daring hopes.
But parted by severe decree, Far different must our fortunes prove; May thine be joy--enough for me To weep and pray for him I love.
The pangs this foolish heart must feel, When hope shall be forever flown, No sullen murmur shall reveal, No selfish murmurs ever own.
Nor will I through life’s weary years, Like a pale drooping mourner move, While I can think my secret tears May wound the heart of him I love.
The furious declaration of Allan had destroyed the romantic plan which she had formed, of nursing in secret her pensive tenderness, without seeking any other requital.
“I mean,” he said, “Mistress Annot Lyle, that having been the means of an honourable knight receiving a severe wound in this day’s conflict,--he having pistolled, somewhat against the law of arms, my horse, which was named after the immortal King of Sweden,--I am desirous of procuring him such solacement as you, madam, can supply, you being like the heathen god Esculapius” (meaning possibly Apollo), “skilful not only in song and in music, but in the more noble art of chirurgery-OPIFERQUE PER ORBEM DICOR.” “If you would have the goodness to explain,” said Annot, too sick at heart to be amused by Sir Dugald’s airs of pedantic gallantry.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>let me wither between heaven and earth, and gorge the hawks and eagles of Ben-Nevis; and so shall this haughty Knight, and this triumphant Thane, never learn the secret I alone can impart; a secret which would make Ardenvohr’s heart leap with joy, were he in the death agony, and which the Earl of Menteith would purchase at the price of his broad earldom.--Come hither, Annot Lyle,” he said, raising himself with unexpected strength; “fear not the sight of him to whom thou hast clung in infancy.
“I could,” said Sir Duncan, his voice struggling between the emotions of doubt, hatred, and anxiety--“I could--but that I know thy race are like the Great Enemy, liars and murderers from the beginning--but could it be true thou tellest me, I could almost forgive thee the injuries thou hast done me.” “Hear it!” said Ranald; “he hath wagered deeply for a son of Diarmid--And you, gentle Thane--the report of the camp says, that you would purchase with life and lands the tidings that Annot Lyle was no daughter of proscription, but of a race noble in your estimation as your own--Well--It is for no love I tell you--The time has been that I would have exchanged this secret against liberty; I am now bartering it for what is dearer than liberty or life.--Annot Lyle is the youngest, the sole surviving child of the Knight of Ardenvohr, who alone was saved when all in his halls besides was given to blood and ashes.” “Can this man speak truth?” said Annot Lyle, scarce knowing what she said; “or is this some strange delusion?” “Maiden,” replied Ranald, “hadst thou dwelt longer with us, thou wouldst have better learnt to know how to distinguish the accents of truth.
Meantime, withdraw--I loved thine infancy, I hate not thy youth--no eye hates the rose in its blossom, though it groweth upon a thorn, and for thee only do I something regret what is soon to follow.
Tarry not their answer, but vanish like the lightning when the black cloud swallows it.--And now depart, beloved son of my best beloved!
Farewell, beloved!
and mayst thou die like thy forefathers, ere infirmity, disease, or age, shall break thy spirit--Begone!--begone!--live free--requite kindness--avenge the injuries of thy race!” The young savage stooped, and kissed the brow of his dying parent; but accustomed from infancy to suppress every exterior sign of emotion, he parted without tear or adieu, and was soon far beyond the limits of Montrose’s camp.
“I believe,” said Dalgetty, “my friend Ranald will be found in his heart to be little better than a heathen.” And he renewed his proposal to procure him the assistance of Dr. Wisheart, Montrose’s military chaplain; “a man,” said Sir Dugald, “very clever in his exercise, and who will do execution on your sins in less time than I could smoke a pipe of tobacco.” “Saxon,” said the dying man, “speak to me no more of thy priest--I die contented.
You love this new-found lady,--your affection is returned.
On the more urgent suit of the noble lover, he requested a few hours to deliberate and consult with his daughter, upon a question so highly important.
Sir Duncan Campbell became fully sensible that the happiness of his new-found daughter depended upon a union with her lover; and unless such were now formed, he saw that Argyle would throw a thousand obstacles in the way of a match in every respect acceptable to himself.
It was under the influence of these considerations that Sir Duncan Campbell announced to the lovers his consent that they should be married in the chapel of the Castle, by Montrose’s chaplain, and as privately as possible.
With the careless and cheerful indifference of his character, he expressed much more joy than wonder at Annot’s good fortune; had no doubt whatever she would merit it, and as she had always been bred in loyal principles, would convey the whole estate of her grim fanatical father to some honest fellow who loved the king.
A more willing guest at the bridal ceremony, certainly a more willing attendant at the marriage feast, was to be expected in Sir Dugald Dalgetty, whom Montrose resolved to invite, as having been a confidant to the circumstances which preceded it.
“I had intended it,” he said, “for my own bridal-garment, as being the least formidable of my warlike equipments, and I have here no peaceful dress.” Sir Dugald made the necessary apologies--would not by any means deprive--and so forth, until it happily occurred to him that it was much more according to military rule that the Earl should be married in his back and breast pieces, which dress he had seen the bridegroom wear at the union of Prince Leo of Wittlesbach with the youngest daughter of old George Frederick, of Saxony, under the auspices of the gallant Gustavus Adolphus, the Lion of the North, and so forth.
In what do you charge me with deceiving you?” “You told me,” answered M’Aulay, “that you would not marry Annot Lyle!--False traitor!--she now waits you at the altar.” “It is you who speak false,” retorted Menteith.
But others thought the credit of the vision sufficiently fulfilled, by the wound inflicted by the hand, and with the weapon, foretold; and all were of opinion, that the incident of the ring, with the death’s head, related to the death of the bride’s father, who did not survive her marriage many months.
The incredulous held, that all this was idle dreaming, and that Allan’s supposed vision was but a consequence of the private suggestions of his own passion, which, having long seen in Menteith a rival more beloved than himself, struggled with his better nature, and impressed upon him, as it were involuntarily, the idea of killing his competitor.
After that happy event, he occupied a situation in the land befitting his rank, lived long, happy alike in public regard and in domestic affection, and died at a good old age.

We were all fond of him, and my mother loved him very much.
The cob was a strong, well-made, good-tempered horse, and we sometimes had a little chat in the paddock, but of course I could not be so intimate with him as with Ginger, who stood in the same stable.
I wouldn&#39;t vex our people for anything; I love them, I do,&quot; said Merrylegs, and he gave a low &quot;ho, ho, ho!&quot;
Our master and mistress were respected and beloved by all who knew them; they were good and kind to everybody and everything; not only men and women, but horses and donkeys, dogs and cats, cattle and birds; there was no oppressed or ill-used creature that had not a friend in them, and their servants took the same tone.
I love horses, and it riles me to see them badly used; it is a bad plan to aggravate an animal till he uses his heels; the first time is not always the last.&quot;
On the other hand, where we saw people who loved their neighbors, and were kind to man and beast, we might know that was God&#39;s mark.&quot;
&quot;Your master never taught you a truer thing,&quot; said John; &quot;there is no religion without love, and people may talk as much as they like about their religion, but if it does not teach them to be good and kind to man and beast it is all a sham--all a sham, James, and it won&#39;t stand when things come to be turned inside out.&quot;
It goes to my heart to hear him.
But you see, I am sore myself; that horse is the pride of my heart, to say nothing of his being such a favorite with the master and mistress; and to think that his life may be flung away in this manner is more than I can bear.
&quot;Bill Starkey,&quot; continued John, &quot;did not mean to frighten his brother into fits when he dressed up like a ghost and ran after him in the moonlight; but he did; and that bright, handsome little fellow, that might have been the pride of any mother&#39;s heart is just no better than an idiot, and never will be, if he lives to be eighty years old.
They hugged poor Merrylegs like an old friend, and so indeed he was.
The only wonder was that he should be in an under situation and not in the place of a head coachman like York; but he had one great fault and that was the love of drink.
I loved to feel his hand on my neck, and arched my crest proudly and happily; but I stood very still, for I knew all his moods, and when he liked me to be quiet, and when gay.
I never loved any other master so well.
&quot;Good Luck is rather particular who she rides with, and mostly prefers those who have got common sense and a good heart; at least that is my experience.&quot;
The six-day drivers all tell me the same, and I have laid by more money in the savings bank than ever I did before; and as for the wife and children, sir, why, heart alive!
Jerry took it to heart a good deal, for of course the work was harder for horse and man.
It often went to my heart to see how the little ponies were used, straining along with heavy loads or staggering under heavy blows from some low, cruel boy.
Jerry kissed the child and said, &quot;Run in to mother, my pet, and tell her I think you had better stay at home to-day and help her.&quot;
Give up the drink or break Polly&#39;s heart!&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I wish we could take you with us,&quot; she said, and then laying her hand on my mane she put her face close to my neck and kissed me.
Dolly was crying and kissed me too.
To be punished and abused when I was doing my very best was so hard it took the heart out of me.
Indignities like these took the heart out of me terribly, but still I did my best and never hung back; for, as poor Ginger said, it was no use; men are the strongest.

Infant bridegroom, uncrowned king, unanointed priest, Soldier, lover, explorer, I see you nuzzle the breast.
And when the west is red With the sunset embers, The lover lingers and sings And the maid remembers.
Lone let it stand, now the friends are all departed, The kind hearts, the true hearts, that loved the place of old.
Blow, blow,&#39; I cry, &#39;my love is home again!&#39;
XIX--TO DR. HAKE (_On receiving a Copy of Verses_) In the beloved hour that ushers day, In the pure dew, under the breaking grey, One bird, ere yet the woodland quires awake, With brief reveille summons all the brake: _Chirp_, _chirp_, it goes; nor waits an answer long; And that small signal fills the grove with song.
It was not music, for I lacked the art, Yet what but frozen music filled my heart?
A child; A youth in ardour but a child in strength, Who after virtue&#39;s golden chariot-wheels Runs ever panting, nor attains the goal.
So thought I, and was sorrowful at heart.

If to feel, in the ink of the slough, And the sink of the mire, Veins of glory and fire Run through and transpierce and transpire, And a secret purpose of glory in every part, And the answering glory of battle fill my heart; To thrill with the joy of girded men To go on for ever and fail and go on again, And be mauled to the earth and arise, And contend for the shade of a word and a thing not seen with the eyes: With the half of a broken hope for a pillow at night That somehow the right is the right And the smooth shall bloom from the rough: Lord, if that were enough?
Honour, anger, valour, fire; A love that life could never tire, Death quench or evil stir, The mighty master Gave to her.
Leave, leave it then, muse of my heart!

He marks the sisters on the mournful shores; And even a fool is silent and adores.
Fair was the crown to behold, and beauty its poorest part-- At once the scar of the wound and the order pinned on the heart.
As when the fevered sick that all night long Listed the wind intone, and hear at last The ever-welcome voice of chanticleer Sing in the bitter hour before the dawn,-- With sudden ardour, these desire the day: So sang in the gloom of youth the bird of hope; So we, exulting, hearkened and desired.
I have since then contended and rejoiced; Amid the glories of the house of life Profoundly entered, and the shrine beheld: Yet when the lamp from my expiring eyes Shall dwindle and recede, the voice of love Fall insignificant on my closing ears, What sound shall come but the old cry of the wind In our inclement city?
But she, secure in the decrees of fate, Made strong her bosom and received the mate, And, men declare, from that marine embrace Conceived the virtues of a stronger race.
But he, though thus with hand and head He ruled, commanded, charmed, and led, And thus in virtue and in might Towered to contemporary sight-- Still in fraternal faith and love, Remained below to reach above, Gave and obeyed the apt command, Pilot and vassal of the land.

XXXIX--TROPIC RAIN As the single pang of the blow, when the metal is mingled well, Rings and lives and resounds in all the bounds of the bell, So the thunder above spoke with a single tongue, So in the heart of the mountain the sound of it rumbled and clung.
And methought that beauty and terror are only one, not two; And the world has room for love, and death, and thunder, and dew; And all the sinews of hell slumber in summer air; And the face of God is a rock, but the face of the rock is fair.
Features of our face, The tones of the voice, the touch of the loved hand, Perish and vanish, one by one, from earth: Meanwhile, in the hall of song, the multitude Applauds the new performer.
One, perchance, One ultimate survivor lingers on, And smiles, and to his ancient heart recalls The long forgotten.
XLIII--TO S. R. CROCKETT (_On receiving a Dedication_) Blows the wind to-day, and the sun and the rain are flying, Blows the wind on the moors to-day and now, Where about the graves of the martyrs the whaups are crying, My heart remembers how!

she lady of the house was, he said, confined to her apartment, and on the point of making her husband a father for the first time, though they had been ten years married.
&quot;I fear from your looks,&quot; said the father, &quot;that you have bad tidings to tell me of my young stranger; perhaps God will resume the blessing He has bestowed ere he attains the age of manhood, or perhaps he is destined to be unworthy of the affection which we are naturally disposed to devote to our offspring.&quot;
But with much in his horoscope which promises many blessings, there is one evil influence strongly predominant, which threatens to subject him to an unhallowed and unhappy temptation about the time when he shall attain the age of twenty-one, which period, the constellations intimate, will he the crisis of his fate.
He then gave his host his address, which was a country-seat near a post-town in the south of England, and bid him an affectionate farewell.
Still the youth was gentle, courteous, affectionate, and submissive to his father&#39;s will, and resisted with all his power the dark suggestions which were breathed into his mind, as it seemed, by some emanation of the Evil Principle, exhorting him, like the wicked wife of job, to curse God and die.
The young man was afterwards married to the beautiful maiden, the first sight of whom had made such an impression on him, and they were consigned over at the close of the story to domestic happiness.--So ended John MacKinlay&#39;s legend.
It appeared, on mature consideration, that Astrology, though its influence was once received and admitted by Bacon himself, does not now retain influence over the general mind sufficient even to constitute the mainspring of a romance.
&quot;&#39;E&#39;en the winsome Gudeman of Lochside, poor body,&#39; replied Jean; &#39;he&#39;s been at Newcastle seeking siller to pay his rent, honest man, but deil-be-lickit he&#39;s been able to gather in, and sae he&#39;s gaun e&#39;en hame wi&#39; a toom purse and a sair heart.&#39;
The following account of her is extracted from the letter of a friend, who for many years enjoyed frequent and favourable opportunities of observing the characteristic peculiarities of the Yetholm tribes.--&#39;Madge Gordon was descended from the Faas by the mother&#39;s side, and was married to a Young.
But there is a far more exact prototype of the worthy Dominie, upon which is founded the part which he performs in the romance, and which, for certain particular reasons, must be expressed very generally.
The estate was sold; and the old man was about to remove from the house of his fathers, to go he knew not whither, when, like an old piece of furniture, which, left alone in its wonted corner, may hold together for a long while, but breaks to pieces on an attempt to move it, he fell down on his own threshold under a paralytic affection.
Such is the outline of Dominie Sampson&#39;s real story, in which there is neither romantic incident nor sentimental passion; but which, perhaps, from the rectitude and simplicity of character which it displays, may interest the heart and fill the eye of the reader as irresistibly as if it respected distresses of a more dignified or refined character.
He found out the door with no small difficulty, and for some time knocked without producing any other answer than a duet between a female and a cur-dog, the latter yelping as if he would have barked his heart out, the other screaming in chorus.
Fielding has described one class as feras consumere nati; but the love of field-sports indicates a certain activity of mind, which had forsaken Mr. Bertram, if ever he possessed it.
His son Dennis Bertram married a daughter of an eminent fanatic, who had a seat in the council of state, and saved by that union the remainder of the family property.
But, as ill chance would have it, he became enamoured of the lady&#39;s principles as well as of her charms, and my author gives him this character: &quot;He was a man of eminent parts and resolution, for which reason he was chosen by the western counties one of the committee of noblemen and gentlemen, to report their griefs to the privy council of Charles II, anent the coming in of the Highland host in 1678.&quot;
Under this gentleman&#39;s supervision small debts grew into large, interests were accumulated upon capitals, movable bonds became heritable, and law charges were heaped upon all; though Ellangowan possessed so little the spirit of a litigant, that he was on two occasions charged to make payment of the expenses of a long lawsuit, although he had never before heard that he had such cases in court.
He was even a kind of favourite with them, and upon the division of a common, or the holding of a black-fishing, or poaching court, or any similar occasion, when they conceived themselves, oppressed by the gentry, they were in the habit of saying to each other, &quot;Ah, if Ellangowan, honest man, had his ain that his forebears had afore him, he wadna see the puir folk trodden down this gait.&quot;
This was his marriage with a lady who had a portion of about four thousand pounds.
Nobody in the neighbourhood could conceive why she married him, and endowed him with her wealth, unless because he had a tall, handsome figure, a good set of features, a genteel address, and the most perfect good-humour.
It was in this lady&#39;s behalf (confined for the first time after her marriage) that the speedy and active express, mentioned by the old dame of the cottage, had been despatched to Kippletringan on the night of Mannering&#39;s arrival.
&quot;Oh, troth, Laird,&quot; continued Meg, during this by-talk, &quot;it&#39;s but to the like o&#39; you ane can open their heart; ye see, they say Dunbog is nae mair a gentleman than the blunker that&#39;s biggit [*Built] the bonnie house down in the howm.
But Mannering was a youthful lover, and might perhaps be influenced by the feelings so exquisitely expressed by a modern poet For fable is Love&#39;s world, his home, his birth-place--Delightedly dwells he &#39;mong fays, and talismans, And spirits, and delightedly believes Divinities, being himself divine.
But still the heart doth need a language, still Doth the old instinct bring back the old names.
And to yon starry world they now are gone, Spirits or gods, that used to shave this earth With man as with their friend, and to the lover Yonder they move, from yonder visible sky Shoot influence down; and even at this day &#39;Tis Jupiter who brings whate&#39;er is great, And Venus who brings everything that&#39;s fair.
But it often happens, such is our natural love for the marvellous, that we willingly contribute our own efforts to beguile our better judgments.
It consisted of two massive round towers, projecting, deeply and darkly, at the extreme angles of a curtain, or flat wall, which united them, and thus protecting the main entrance, that opened through a lofty arch in the centre of the curtain into the inner court of the castle.
Here then, and with thee Sophia!-- We shall not pursue a lover&#39;s day-dream any farther.
On entering the gateway, he found that the rude magnificence of the inner court amply corresponded with the grandeur of the exterior.
That end of the court which faced the entrance had also been formerly closed by a range of buildings; but owing, it was said, to its having been battered by the ships of the Parliament under Deane, during the long civil war, this part of the castle was much more ruinous than the rest, and exhibited a great chasm, through which Mannering could observe the sea, and the little vessel (an armed lugger) which retained her station in the centre of the bay.
Mr. Glossin had a vote upon Ellangowan&#39;s property; and he was now determined that his patron should have one also, there being no doubt which side Mr. Bertram would embrace in the contest.
Na, na, the muckle chumlay in the Auld Place reeked like a killogie [*Lime-kiln] in his time, and there were as mony puir folk riving at the banes in the court, and about the door, as there were gentles in the ha&#39;.
The aged sibyls blessed the bridal bed of the laird when he married, and the cradle of the heir when born.
The affection of this woman became matter of suspicion, not indeed to the Laird, who was never hasty in suspecting evil, but to his wife, who had indifferent health and poor spirits.
The Dominie loved his young charge, and was enraptured with his own success, in having already brought him so far in his learning as to spell words of three syllables.
He left the executive part of the business to the officers of the law, under the immediate direction of Frank Kennedy, a supervisor, or riding-officer, belonging to the excise, who had of late become intimate at the Place, and of whom we shall have more to say in the next chapter.
There was also a natural yearning of heart on parting with so many known and familiar faces; and to this feeling Godfrey Bertram was peculiarly accessible, from the limited qualities of his mind, which sought its principal amusements among the petty objects around him.
&quot;For the love of life, Ellangowan,&quot; he said, &quot;get up to the castle!
the affectionate creature repeated, in notes of the deepest distress.
&quot;I am sure, neighbour Ovens,&quot; said the hostess, &quot;the Hazlewoods of Hazlewood, though they are a very gude auld family in the county, never thought, till within these twa score o&#39; years, of evening themselves till the Ellangowans--Wow, woman, the Bertrams of Ellangowan are the auld Dingawaies lang syne--there is a sang about ane o&#39; them marrying a daughter of the King of Man; it begins-- &quot;Blythe Bertram&#39;s ta&#39;en him ower the faem, To wed a wife, and bring her hame-- I daur say Mr. Skreigh can sing us the ballant.&quot;

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I was young then, sir, and newly married to Bailie Mac-Candlish, that&#39;s dead and gone--(a sigh)--and muckle fun I&#39;ve had wi&#39; the Supervisor.
And the Laird was three years married without having a family-and he was sae left to himself, that it was thought he held ower muckle troking [*Trafficking] and communing wi&#39; that Meg Merrilies, wha was the maist notorious, witch in a&#39; Galloway and Dumfriesshire baith.&quot;
&quot;Aweel,&quot; said the postilion, &quot;it might be sae--I canna say against it, for I was not in the country at the time; but John Wilson was a blustering kind of chield, without the heart of a sprug.&quot;
&quot;I know it,&quot; replied his master.--&quot;And now, madam, it you will have the goodness to allow me to occupy the parlour you mentioned, as you are disappointed of your guests--&quot; &quot;Certainly, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Mac-Candlish, and hastened to light the way with all the imperative bustle which an active landlady loves to display on such occasions.
Again, the bishop wished me to marry the niece and heiress of the Dean of Lincoln; and my uncle, the alderman, proposed to me the only daughter of old Sloethorn, the great wine-merchant, rich enough to play at span-counters with moidores, and make thread-papers of bank notes--and somehow I slipped my neck out of both nooses, and married--poor--poor Sophia Wellwood.
I will tell you the cause more in detail than I had the heart to do while under your hospitable roof.
My respectful compliments to Mrs. Mervyn, and I will trust you, though you boast to be so lively a young gentleman, to kiss Julia for me.-- &quot;Adieu, dear Mervyn.-- Mr. Mac-Morlan now entered the room.
Then, life and love were new, and all the prospect was gilded by their rays.
And now, disappointed in affection, sated with fame, and what the world calls success, his mind goaded by bitter and repentant recollection, his best hope was to find a retirement in which he might nurse the melancholy that was to accompany him to his grave.
But when the general murmur announced that the unfortunate Mr. Bertram had broken his heart in the effort to leave the mansion of his forefathers, there poured forth a torrent of sympathy, like the waters from the rock when stricken by the wand of the, prophet.
A home, therefore, and an hospitable reception, were secured to her, and she went on, with better heart, to pay the wages and receive the adieus of the few domestics of her father&#39;s family.
&quot; During this speech, the longest ever Dominie Sampson was known to utter, the affectionate creature&#39;s eyes streamed with tears, and neither Lucy nor Mac-Morlan could refrain from sympathising with this unexpected burst of feeling and attachment.
Mr. MacMorlan&#39;s knowledge of the world induced him to put this colour upon the matter, aware, that however honourable the fidelity of the Dominie&#39;s attachment might be, both to his own heart and to the family of Ellangowan, his exterior ill qualified him to be a &quot;squire of dames,&quot; and rendered him, upon the whole, rather a ridiculous appendage to a beautiful young woman of seventeen.
Still, however, he gained something, and it was the glory of his heart to carry it to Mr. Mac-Morlan weekly, a slight peculium only subtracted, to supply his snuff-box and tobacco-pouch.
&quot;Your daughter has much of the romantic turn of your disposition, with a little of that love of admiration which all pretty women share less or more.
I paid her the kiss you sent her with all my heart, and she rapped my fingers for my reward with all hers.
She is generous and romantic, and writes six sheets a week to a female correspondent; and it&#39;s a sad thing to lack a subject in such a case, either for exercise of the feelings or of the pen.
But it is a part of my father&#39;s character, of whom it is impossible to say, whether I love, admire, or fear him the most.
You will call this romantic: but consider I was born in the land of talisman and spell, and my childhood lulled by tales which you can only enjoy through the gauzy frippery of a French translation.
her actions were guided by the heart rather than the head; and shall her daughter, who inherits all her weakness, be the first to withdraw the veil from her defects?&quot;
&quot;If India be the land of magic, this my dearest Matilda, is the country of romance.
The scenery is such as nature brings together in her sublimest moods;--sounding cataracts-hills which rear their scathed heads to the sky-lakes, that, winding up the shadowy valleys, lead at every turn to yet more romantic recesses-rocks which catch the clouds of heaven.
I delight to make him scramble to the tops of eminences and to the foot of waterfalls, and am obliged in turn to admire his turnips, his lucerne, and his timothy grass.--He thinks me, I fancy, a simple romantic Miss, with some--(the word will he out) beauty, and some good nature; and I hold that the gentleman has good taste for the female outside, and do not expect he should comprehend my sentiments further.
my dearest Matilda, how would time pass away, even in this paradise of romance, tenanted as it is by a pair assorting so ill with the scenes around them, were it not for your fidelity in replying to my uninteresting details?
How could you suggest, my dear Matilda, that my feelings, considering I had parted from him so young, rather arose from the warmth of my imagination than of my heart?--Oh!
&quot;Our hours here are early--earlier than my heart, with its load of care, can compose itself to rest.
&quot;It was some time ere I could summon courage to step on the balcony--nothing could have emboldened me to do so but the strong conviction of my mind, that he was still alive, and that we should again meet--but that conviction did embolden me, and I ventured, though with a throbbing heart.
Enough for lane the firm resolution, that Matilda shall not blush for her friend, my father for his daughter, nor my lover for her on whom he has fixed his affection.&quot;
WE must proceed with our extracts from Miss Mannering&#39;s letters, which throw light upon natural good sense, principle, and feelings, blemished by an imperfect education, and the folly of a misjudging mother, who called her husband in her heart a tyrant until she feared him as such, and read romances until she became so enamoured of the complicated intrigues which they contain, as to assume the management of a little family novel of her own, and constitute her daughter, a girl of sixteen, the principal heroine.
Thus she frequently entered upon a scheme merely for pleasure, or perhaps for the love of contradiction, plunged deeper into it than she was aware, endeavoured to extricate herself by new arts, or to cover her error by dissimulation, became involved in meshes of her own weaving, and was forced to carry on, for fear of discovery, machinations which she had at first resorted to in mere wantonness.
Fortunately the young man whom she so imprudently introduced into her intimate society, and encouraged to look up to her daughter, had a fund of principle and honest pride, which rendered him a safer intimate than Mrs. Mannering ought to have dared to hope or expect.
The obscurity of his birth could alone he objected to him; in every other respect, With prospects bright upon the world he came, Pure love of virtue, strong desire of fame; Men watched the way his lofty mind would take, And all foretold the progress he would make.
He has, too, a tinge of romance in his disposition; and I have seen the narrative of a generous action, a trait of heroism, or virtuous self-denial, extract tears from him, which refused to flow at a tale of mere distress.
The breaking out of the war, and the straits to which we were at first reduced, threw the army open to all young men who were disposed to embrace that mode of life; and Brown, whose genius had a strong military tendency, was the first to leave what might have been the road to wealth, and to choose that of fame.
These romantic lakes attract numerous visitors, who indulge their enthusiasm in visiting the scenery at all hours, and we hoped, that--if Brown were noticed from the house, he might pass for one of those admirers of nature, who was giving vent to his feelings through the medium of music.
Lord help me, I should have had such lectures about the dangers of love and the night air on the lake, the risk arising from colds and fortune-hunters, the comfort and convenience of sack-whey and closed windows!--I cannot help trifling, Matilda, though my heart is sad enough What Brown will do I cannot guess.
He lays the blame of his being discomposed and out of humour to the loss of a purchase in the south-west of Scotland, on which he had set his heart; but I do not suspect his equanimity of being so easily thrown off its balance.
His eyes are naturally rather light in colour, but agitation or anger gives them a darker and more fiery glance; he has a custom also of drawing in his lips, when much moved, which implies a combat between native ardour of temper and the habitual power of self-command.
&quot;&#39;Not a governess, for the love of Heaven, papa!&#39;
&quot;&#39;She is as superior to you, my love, in personal appearance, as in prudence and affection for her friends.&#39;
&#39;Come, Julia,&#39; he said, &#39;you are a sad girl, but I gain nothing by scolding you.--Of these two strangers, the young lady is one whom you cannot fail, I think, to love--the person whom, for want of a better term, I called chaplain, is a very worthy, and somewhat ridiculous personage, who will never find out you laugh at him, if you don&#39;t laugh very loud indeed.&#39;
The fate of Dominie Sampson would have been deplorable had it depended upon any one except Mannering, who was an admirer of originality, for a separation from Lucy Bertram would have certainly broken his heart.
The Colonel then led his daughter up to Miss Bertram, and, taking the hand of the latter, with an air of great kindness, and almost paternal affection, he said, &quot;Julia, this is the young lady whom I hope our good friends have prevailed on to honour our house with a long visit.
In a day or two Mr. and Mrs. Mac-Morlan left Woodbourne, after taking an affectionate farewell of their late guest.
He entered them in the catalogue in his best running hand, forming each letter with the accuracy of a lover writing a valentine, and placed each individually on the destined shelf with all the reverence which I have seen a lady pay to a jar of old china.
The interest he had secured in her bosom was such as she had been unable to conceal from him, and with all the courage of romantic gallantry he determined upon perseverance.
&quot;And now, I hope you are expiring with curiosity to learn the end of my romance.
&quot;I protest to you, Delaserre, I often think there is a little contradiction enters into the ardour of my pursuit.
There is only one circumstance that chills me a little-Julia is young and romantic.
She knows difficulties only by name; and, if she thinks of love and a farm, it is a ferme ornee, such as is only to be found in poetic description, or in the park of a gentleman of twelve thousand a year.
Although Julia&#39;s beauty and playful tenderness have made an impression on my heart never to be erased, I must be satisfied that she perfectly understands the advantages she foregoes, before she sacrifices them for my sake.
Or will a difference of dress, of attendance, of style, as it is called, of the power of shifting at pleasure the scenes in which she seeks amusement,--will these outweigh, in her estimation, the prospect of domestic happiness, and the interchange of unabating affection?
I remember when we first mounted that celebrated pass in the Mysore country, while most of the others felt only awe and astonishment at the height and grandeur of the scenery, I rather shared your feelings and those of Cameron, whose admiration of such wild rocks was blended with familiar love, derived from early association.
Jog on, jog on, the footpath way, And merrily hent the stile-a: A merry heart goes all the day, A sad one tires in a mile-a.
For each peasant whom he chanced to meet, he had a kind greeting or a good-humoured jest; the hardy Cumbrians grinned as they passed, and said, &quot;that&#39;s a kind heart, God bless un!&quot;
Immediately around, them there is generally some little attempt at cultivation; but a half-bred foal or two, straggling about with shackles on their hind legs, to save the trouble of enclosures, intimate the farmer&#39;s chief resource to be the breeding of horses.
They had no pretensions to magnificence of height, or to romantic shapes, nor did their smooth swelling slopes exhibit either rocks or woods.
Amid this bustle, Brown was fain to secure Wasp from the other dogs, who, with ardour corresponding more to their own names than to the hospitable temper of their owner, were much disposed to use the intruder roughly.
&quot;Deil&#39;s in the wife,&quot; said Dandie Dinmont, shaking off his spouse&#39;s embrace, but gently and with a look of great affection;--&quot;deil&#39;s in ye, Ailie--d&#39;ye no see the stranger gentleman?&quot;
Wow, man, a married man, a bonny family like yours, should ken better what a father&#39;s life&#39;s worth in the warld.&quot;
gudewife,&quot; said her husband, with a smack that had much more affection than ceremony in it; &quot;never mind--never mind--there&#39;s a gentleman that will tell you, that just when I had ga&#39;en up to Lourie Lowther&#39;s, and had bidden the drinking of twa cheerers, and gotten just in again upon the moss, and was whigging cannily [*Cautiously] awa hame, twa land-loupers jumpit out of a peat-bog on me as I was thinking, and got me down, and knevelled [*Beat] me sair aneuch, or I could gar my whip walk about their lugs--and troth, gudewife, if this honest gentleman hadna come up, I would have gotten mair licks than I like, and lost mair siller than I could weel spare; so ye maun be thankful to him for it, under God.&quot;
[*Chest] &quot;God bless the gentleman, and e&#39;en God bless him wi&#39; a&#39; my heart--but what can we do for him, but to gie him the meat and quarters we wadna refuse to the poorest body on earth--unless (her eye directed to the pocket-book, but with a feeling of natural propriety which made the inference the most delicate possible), unless there was ony other way--&quot; Brown saw, and estimated at its due rate, the mixture of simplicity and grateful generosity which took the downright way of expressing itself, yet qualified with so much delicacy; he was aware his own appearance, plain at best, and now torn and spattered with blood, made him an object of pity at least, and perhaps of charity.
Our knight of the broken head first kissed and hugged them all round, then distributed whistles, penny-trumpets, and Gingerbread, and, lastly, when the tumult of their joy and welcome got beyond bearing, exclaimed to his guest--&quot;This is a&#39; the gudewife&#39;s fault, Captain--she will gie the bairns a&#39; their ain way.&quot;
Often he thought of his friend Dudley the artist, when he observed the effect produced by the strong red glare on the romantic banks under which the boat glided.

&quot;Captain, come back,&quot; said a little fat roll-about girl of six, holding her mouth up to be kissed, &quot;and I&#39;ll be your wife my ainsell.&quot;
&quot;The good dame too, with matron modesty, and an affectionate simplicity that marked the olden time, offered her cheek to the departing guest--&quot;It&#39;s little the like of us can do,&quot; she said, &quot;little indeed--but yet--if there were but anything--&quot; &quot;Now, my dear Mrs. Dinmont, you embolden me to make a request--would you but have the kindness to weave me, or work me, just such a gray plaid as the goodman wears?&quot;
If thou hast any love of mercy in thee, Turn me upon my face that I may die.
Anxious to observe what was to happen, Brown arranged, as softly as he could, the means of peeping from under the coverings by which he was hidden, and awaited with a throbbing heart the issue of this strange and most unpleasant adventure.
The agony of his attention grew yet keener, and while the villains pulled out and admired the different articles of his clothes and linen, he eagerly listened for some indication that might intimate the fate of the postilion.
Although the snow in many places bid the pathway, and Rendered the footing uncertain and unsafe, Meg proceeded with a firm and determined step, which indicated an intimate knowledge of the ground she traversed.
How can you upbraid me, my dearest Matilda, with abatement in friendship, or fluctuation in affection?
Is it possible for me to forget that you are the chosen of my heart, in whose faithful bosom I have deposited every feeling which your poor Julia dares to acknowledge to herself?
&quot;Besides, my love, I must really use the apology of all stupid correspondents, that I have nothing to say.
&quot;To return to Lucy Bertram--No, my dearest Matilda, she can never, never rival you in my regard, so that all your affectionate jealousy on that account is without foundation.
She is, to be sure, a very pretty, a very sensible, a very affectionate girl, and I think there are few persons to whose consolatory friendship I could have recourse more freely in what are called the real evils of life.
Heaven knows, and you know, my dearest Matilda, that these diseases of the heart require the balm of sympathy and affection as much as the evils of a more obvious and determinate character.
Were I sick of a fever, she would sit up night after night to nurse me with the most unrepining patience; but with the fever of the heart, which my Matilda has soothed so often, she has no more sympathy than her old tutor.
And yet, what provokes me is, that the demure monkey actually has a lover of her own, and that their mutual affection (for mutual I take it to be) has a great deal of complicated and romantic interest.
&quot;But with all this moderation, and self-denial, and modesty, and so forth, Lucy is a sly girl--I am sure she loves young Hazlewood, and I am sure he has some guess of that, and would probably bring her to acknowledge it too, if my father or she would allow him an opportunity.
He made some trifling observation, and her reply was one in which nothing but an ear as acute as that of a lover, or a curious observer like myself, could have distinguished anything more cold and dry than usual.
I am sensible I am but a thoughtless girl, and if a graver companion could render you more happy--&#39; &quot;There was a mixture of displeasure and grave affection in the manner in which my father took my hand, that was a severe reproof to me for trifling with his feelings.
But I need not take much merit for acting as I ought to do; this same Mr. Vanbeest Brown is by no means so very ardent a lover as to hurry the object of his attachment into such inconsiderate steps.
&quot;And why, you will say, when I expect such steady and unalterable constancy from a lover, why should I be anxious about what Hazlewood does, or to whom he offers his attentions?--I ask myself the questions a hundred times a day, and it only receives the very silly answer, that one does not like to be neglected, though one would not encourage a serious infidelity.
I remember, in our stolen voyages to the world of fiction, you always admired the grand and the romantic--tales of knights, dwarfs, giants, and distressed damsels, soothsayers, visions, beckoning ghosts, and bloody hands,--whereas I was partial to the involved intrigues of private life, or at furthest, to so much only of the supernatural as is conferred by the agency of an Eastern genie or a beneficent fairy.
You would have loved to shape your course of life over the broad ocean, with its dead calms and howling tempests, its, tornadoes, and its billows mountain-high,--whereas I should like to trim my little pinnace to a brisk breeze in some inland lake or tranquil bay where there was just difficulty of navigation sufficient to give interest and to require skill, without any sensible degree of danger.
So that, upon the whole, Matilda, I think you should have had my father, with his pride of arms and of ancestry, his chivalrous point of honour, his high talents, and his abstruse and mystic studies--You should have had Lucy Bertram too for your friend, whose fathers, with names which alike defy memory and orthography, ruled over this romantic country, and whose birth took place, as I have been indistinctly informed, under circumstances of deep and peculiar interest--You should have had, too, our Scottish residence, surrounded by mountains, and our lonely walks to haunted ruins--And I should have had, in exchange, the lawns and shrubs, and greenhouses, and conservatories, of Pine Park, with your, good, quiet, indulgent aunt, her chapel in the morning, her nap after dinner, her hand at whist in the evening, not forgetting her fat coach-horses and fatter coachman.
I closed my letter to you in high spirits, with some flippant remarks on your taste for the romantic and extraordinary in fictitious narrative.
&#39;We want our goods, which we have been robbed of by these sharks,&#39; said the fellow; &#39;and our lieutenant bids me say, that if they are delivered, we&#39;ll go off for this bout without clearing scores with the rascals who took them; but if not, we&#39;ll burn the house, and have the heart&#39;s blood every one in it.&#39;
Then poor Lucy&#39;s ill-concealed grief, occasioned by her lover&#39;s wound, is another source of distress to me, and everything round me appears to bear witness against that indiscretion which has occasioned this calamity.
&quot;I must not omit to say that my father is very kind and affectionate.
In either case he may wait the issue of Hazlewood&#39;s wound with safety and with patience, for the communication of these countries with Scotland, for the purpose of justice, is not (thank Heaven) of an intimate nature.
His motives for exertion on this occasion were manifold; but we presume that our readers, from what they already know of this gentleman, will acquit him of being actuated by any zealous or intemperate love of abstract justice.
He therefore felt acutely the general want of respect, and particularly when he contrasted his own character and reception in society with those of Mr. MacMorlan, who, in far inferior worldly circumstances, was beloved and respected both by rich and poor, and was slowly but securely laying the foundation of a moderate fortune, with the general goodwill and esteem of all who knew him.
&quot;Mrs. Mac-Candlish, I wish to know if the justices are to dine here as usual after the business of the court on Tuesday?&quot;
&quot;Tut, we just said that was Miss Lucy Bertram of Ellangowan, that should ance have had a great estate in the country--and that was Miss Jowlia Mannering, that was to be married to young Hazlewood--See as she was hinging on his arm--we just spoke about our country clashes like--he was a very frank man.&quot;
&quot;Ou, he just stared at the young leddies very keen like, and asked if it was for certain that the marriage was to be between Miss Mannering and young Hazlewood--and I answered him that it was for positive and absolute certain, as I had an undoubted right to say sae--for my third cousin Jean Clavers (she&#39;s a relation o&#39; your ain, Mr. Glossin, ye wad ken Jean lang syne?
&quot;Only think,&quot; said Mrs. Mac-Candlish, &quot;what a hard heart he maun hae had, to think o&#39; hurting the poor young gentleman in the very presence of the leddy he was to be married to!&quot;
Mac-Guffog, a stout bandy-legged fellow, with a neck like a bull, a face like a--firebrand, and a most portentous squint of the left eye, began, after various contortions by way of courtesy to the justice, to tell his story, eking it out by sundry sly nods and knowing winks, which appeared to bespeak an intimate correspondence of ideas between the narrator and his principal auditor.
Glossin, though a bold and hardy man, felt his heart throb, and his knees knock together, when he prepared to enter this den of secret iniquity, in order to hold conference with a felon, whom he justly accounted one of the most desperate and depraved of men.
&quot;Nein, nein; the kinchin got about the old man&#39;s heart, and he gave him his own name, and bred him up in the office, and then sent him to India--I believe he would have packed him back here, but his nephew told him it would do up the free trade for many a day, if the youngster got back to Scotland.&quot;
Well then, take another schnaps--the cold&#39;s at your heart still.--And now tell me, are any of your old crew with you?&quot;
&quot;Oh very well--perhaps you are right--it&#39;s quite time enough, and I love to see a young gentleman cautious.
No, no, I love the smack of the whip--I have a little, a very little law yet, at the service of my friends.&quot;
&quot;I fear I cannot,&quot; replied Mac-Morlan; &quot;I must attend a jury trial before our court.&quot;
As soon as they arrived in Edinburgh, and were established at the George Inn near Bristol Port, then kept by old Cockburn (I love to be particular), the Colonel desired the waiter to procure him a guide to Mr. Pleydell&#39;s, the advocate, for whom he had a letter of introduction from Mr. Mac-Morlan.
One or two eminent lawyers still saw their clients in taverns, as was the general custom fifty years before; and although their habits were already considered as old-fashioned by the younger barristers, yet the custom of mixing wine and revelry with serious business was still maintained by those serious counsellors, who loved the old road, either because it was such, or because they had got too well used to it to travel any other.
Mr. Counsellor Pleydell, such as we have described him, was enthroned as a monarch, in an elbow-chair, placed, on the dining-table, his scratch wig on one side, his head crowned with a bottle-slider, his eye leering with an expression betwixt fun and the effects of wine, while his court around him resounded with such crambo scraps of verse as these .
exclaimed this second Justinian; &quot;see ye not a stranger knight from foreign parts arrived at this our court of Holyrood--with our bold yeoman Andrew Dinmont, who has succeeded to the keeping of our royal flocks within the forest of Jedwood, where, thanks to our royal care in the administration of justice, they feed as safe as if they were within the bounds of Fife?
May not a monarch love a maid of low degree?
But he acknowledged a marriage, and satisfied the kirk--and now I wad ken frae you if we hae not some claim by law?&quot;
But this poor farce has neither truth, nor art, To please the fancy or to touch the heart.
We are conversant with the crimes and distresses of civil society, as you are with those that occur in a state of war, and to do our duty in either case a little apathy is perhaps necessary--But the devil take a soldier whose heart can be as hard as his sword, and his dam catch the lawyer who bronzes his bosom instead of his forehead!--But come, I am losing my Saturday at e&#39;en--will you have the kindness to trust me with these papers which relate to Miss Bertram&#39;s business?
I should wish much to hear some of your Scottish preachers whose talents have done such honour to your country--your Blair, your Robertson, or your Henry; and I embrace--your kind offer with all my heart.--Only,&quot; drawing the lawyer a little aside, and turning his eye towards Sampson, &quot;my worthy friend there in the reverie is a little helpless and abstracted, and my servant, Barnes, who is his pilot in ordinary, cannot well assist him here, especially as he has expressed his determination of going to some of your darker and more remote places of worship.&quot;
&quot;I will commit your friend to this man&#39;s charge,&quot; said Pleydell; &quot;he&#39;ll attend him, or conduct him, wherever he chooses to go, with a happy indifference as to kirk or market, meeting or court of justice, or any other place whatever--and bring him safe home at whatever hour you appoint; so that Mr. Barnes there may be left to the freedom of his own will.&quot;
&quot;And yet that reverend gentleman,&quot; said Pleydell, &quot;whom I love for his father&#39;s sake and his own, has nothing of the sour or pharisaical pride which has been imputed to some of the early fathers of the Calvinistic Kirk of Scotland.
&quot;Why, I hope, Colonel, a plain man may go to heaven without thinking about them at all--besides, inter nos, I am a member of the suffering and Episcopal Church of Scotland--the shadow of a shade now, and fortunately so--but I love to pray where my fathers prayed before me, without thinking worse of the Presbyterian forms, because they do not affect me with the same associations.&quot;

A reasonable number of scythes and hour-glasses, and death&#39;s heads, and cross-bones, garnished the following sprig of sepulchral poetry, to the memory of the founder of the mausoleum;-- Nathaniel&#39;s heart, Bezaleel&#39;s hand.
interest marked as paid to Martinmas last, carefully folded up in a new set of words to the old tune of &quot;Over the Water to Charlie&quot;.--there, was a curious love correspondence between the deceased and a certain Lieutenant O&#39;Kean of a marching regiment of foot; and tied up with the letters was a document, which at once explained to the relatives why a connection that boded them little good had been suddenly broken off, being the Lieutenant&#39;s bond for two hundred pounds upon which no interest whatever appeared to have been paid.
That young fellow, who has not had the decency to put off his boots and buckskins, might have stood as forward as most of them in the graces of the old lady, who loved to look upon a comely young man; but it is thought he has forfeited the moment of fortune, by sometimes neglecting her tea-table when solemnly invited; sometimes appearing there, when he had been dining with blither company; twice treading upon her cat&#39;s tail, and once affronting her parrot.
answered the barrister,--&quot;why does a cat not kill a mouse when she takes him?--the consciousness of power and the love of teasing, I suppose.
The farmer turned, infinitely gratified even by this sort of notice; for in his heart, next to his own landlord, he honoured a lawyer in high practice.
&#39;It&#39;s me that says it,&#39; says she, &#39;that may say it with a sad heart.&#39;
I will gladly come to--shire myself to assist at her examination--I am still in the commission of the peace there, though I have ceased to be Sheriff--I never had anything more at heart in my life than tracing that murder, and the fate of the child.
&quot;And his daughter,&quot; said Brown, with a throbbing heart, &quot;is going to be married into a great family too, as I have heard?&quot;
or what could she suppose of conduct, which must have made him appear to her regardless alike of her peace of mind, and of the interests of their affection?
The line of sea-coast, with all its varied curves, indentures, and embayments, swept away from the sight on either hand, in that varied, intricate, yet graceful and easy line, which the eye loves so well to pursue.

&quot;Observe,&quot; he called out at the same time, &quot;that I have no purpose to resist legal authority; satisfy me that you have a magistrates warrant, and are authorised to make this arrest, and I will obey it quietly; but let no man who loves his life venture to approach me, till I am satisfied for what crime, and by whose authority, I am apprehended.&quot;
&quot;Hold your tongue and be d-d, you--,&quot; answered her loving husband, with two additional epithets of great energy, but which we beg to be excused from repeating.
Bertram was now in the small court already mentioned.
Nor can this he thought surprising, when it is considered, that, unless on such occasions, their view was confined to the grated front of their prison, the high and sable walls of the courtyard, the heaven above them, and the pavement beneath their feet; a sameness of landscape, which, to use the poet&#39;s expression, &quot;lay like a load on the wearied eye,&quot; and had fostered in some a callous and dull misanthropy, in others that sickness of the heart which induces him who is immured already in a living grave, to wish for a sepulchre yet more calm and sequestered.
When he had cast his eye around, on faces on which guilt, and despondence, and low excess, had fixed their stigma; upon the spendthrift, and the swindler, and the thief, the bankrupt debtor, the &quot;moping idiot, and the madman gay,&quot; whom a paltry spirit of economy congregated to share this dismal habitation, he felt his heart recoil with inexpressible loathing from enduring the contamination of their society even for a moment.
&quot;Ay, ay, come along then, Captain,&quot; said the fellow, with a contortion of visage which he intended to be a smile; &quot;and I&#39;ll tell you now,--to show you that I have a conscience, as ye ca&#39;t, d-n me if I charge ye abune sixpence a day for the freedom o&#39; the court, and ye may walk in&#39;t very near three hours a day, and play at pitch-and-toss and handba&#39;, and what not.&quot;
He had often observed, and now remembered, that when his former colonel took the part of any one, it was never by halves, and that he seemed to love those persons most who had lain under obligation to him.
And now, gudeman, an ever ye wish him weel, ye maun ride down to Portanferry, and let nae grass grow at the nag&#39;s heels; and if ye find him in confinement, ye maun stay beside him night and day, for a day or twa, for he&#39;ll want friends that hae baith heart and hand; and if ye neglect this ye&#39;ll never rue but ance, for it will be for a&#39; your life., &quot;&#39;But, safe us, man,&#39; quo&#39; I, &#39;how did ye learn a&#39; this?
The affectionate heart of the poor Dominie had always reproached him, that his negligence in leaving the child in the care of Frank Kennedy had been the proximate cause of the murder of the one, the loss of the other, the death of Mrs. Bertram, and the ruin of the family of his patron.
&quot;Hae then,&quot; said she, placing the dish before him, &quot;there&#39;s what will warm your heart.&quot;
Besides, the Laird himself delayed our young lover&#39;s departure for a considerable time, endeavouring, with long and superfluous rhetoric, to insinuate to Sir Robert Hazlewood, through the medium of his son, his own particular ideas respecting the line of a meditated turnpike road.
It is greatly to the shame of our young lover&#39;s apprehension, that after the tenth reiterated account of the matter, he could not see the advantage to be obtained by the proposed road passing over the Lang-hirst, Windyknowe, the Goodhouse-park, Hailziecroft, and then crossing the river at Simon&#39;s Pool, and so by the road to Kippletringan; and the less eligible line pointed out by the English surveyor, which would go clear through the main enclosures at Hazlewood, and cut within a mile, or nearly so, of the house itself, destroying the privacy and pleasure, as his informer contended, of the grounds.
But ye hae nae mair heart, than a cat.&quot;
Upon my word, I believe something very extraordinary has taken place--Get up, for the love of Heaven, and let us be on our guard.&quot;
Deil, but it wad break my heart in a fortnight.
neighbourhood, now aroused, and in complete agitation, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour; some from interest in the free trade, and most from the general love of mischief and tumult, natural to a vulgar populace.
Mannering was not, however, a man to be questioned, even by those whom he most loved, upon the cause of the mental agitation which these signs expressed.
Miss Lucy Bertram, my love, I am most happy to see you.&quot;
--and he folded her in his arms, and gave her a hearty kiss on each side of the face, to which Lucy submitted in blushing resignation.
&quot;With all my heart,&quot; said Pleydell, &quot;providing I do not lose the ladies&#39; company a moment the sooner.
I love the caena, the supper of the ancients, the pleasant meal and social glass that wash out of one&#39;s mind the cobwebs that business or gloom have been spinning in our brains all day.&#39;
&quot;And then,&quot; said the old beau garcon, &quot;although for six times three hundred and sixty-five days, your swain has placed the capuchin round your neck, and the stove under your feet, and driven your little sledge upon the ice in winter, and your cabriole through the dust in summer, you may dismiss him at once, without reason or apology, upon the two thousand one hundred and ninetieth day, which, according to my hasty calculation, and without reckoning leap-years, will complete the cycle of the supposed adoration, and that without your amiable feelings having the slightest occasion to be alarmed for the consequences to those of Mynheer.&quot;
&quot;Why, upon that point of the argument, Miss Mannering, it is as difficult to find a heart that will break, as a glass that will not; and for that reason I would press the value of mine own--were it not that I see Mr. Sampson&#39;s eyes have been closed, and his hands clasped--for some time, attending the end of our conference to begin the grace.--And, to say the truth, the appearance of the wild-ducks is very appetising.&quot;
&quot;Forgive me, madam,&quot; answered the counsellor; &quot;the French themselves, the patterns of all that is gallant, term their tavern-keepers restaurateurs, alluding, doubtless, to the relief they afford the disconsolate lover, when bowed down to the earth by his mistress&#39;s severity.
Mannering saw before him the man whom he supposed he had killed in India; Julia beheld her lover in a most peculiar and hazardous situation; and Lucy Bertram at once knew the person who had fired upon young Hazlewood.
&quot;Julia, my love, you had better retire.
&quot;Very imperfectly; yet I have a strong idea, perhaps more deeply impressed upon me by subsequent hard usage, that I was during my childhood the object of much solicitude and affection.
&quot;Yes, it was in a wood,&quot; continued Bertram, as long past and confused ideas arranged themselves in his reviving recollection &quot;and some one was with me--this worthy and affectionate gentleman, I think.&quot;
&quot;Thou art a fine young fellow, I&#39;ll be bound for thee,&quot; said Pleydell, &quot;and since you have wanted a father so long, I wish from my heart I could claim the paternity myself.
And so-saying, the old gentleman took his candle and left the room; and the company dispersed, after the Dominie had once more hugged and embraced his &quot;little Harry Bertram,&quot; as he continued to call the young soldier of six feet high.
Mannering could not bring himself to acknowledge the astrological prediction; and Bertram was, from motives which may be easily conceived, silent respecting his love for Julia.
&quot;Yes, look at him well--he is your father&#39;s living image; and as God has deprived you of your dear parents--O my children, love one another!&quot;
said Bertram, giving way to all that family affection, which had so long slumbered in his bosom for want of an object to expand itself upon.
said Bertram, shaking the Dominie&#39;s hand;&quot; he deserves the love with which I have always regarded even that dim and imperfect shadow of his memory which my childhood retained.&quot;
He that is too proud to vindicate the affection and confidence which he conceives should be given without solicitation, must meet much, and perhaps deserved disappointment.
It is enough that one dearest and most regretted member of my family has gone to the grave without knowing me; let me not lose the confidence of a child, who ought to love me if she really loves herself.&quot;
&quot;Well, my love,&quot; kissing her forehead, &quot;Itrust we shall not call upon you for anything too heroic.
With respect to this young gentleman&#39;s addresses, I expect in the first place that all clandestine correspondence--which no young woman can entertain for a moment without lessening herself in her own eyes, and in those of her lover--I request, I say, that clandestine correspondence of every kind may be given up, and that you will refer Mr. Bertram to me for the reason.
The first part of this speech affected Julia a good deal; the comparative merit of the ancestors of the Bertrams and Mannerings excited a secret smile, but the conclusion was such as to soften a heart peculiarly open to the feelings of generosity.
&quot;Thank you, my love; my anxiety (kissing her) is on your account.--Now wipe these witnesses from your eyes, and so to breakfast.&quot;
Lucy, while she indulged to the uttermost her affection for her recovered brother, began to think of the quarrel betwixt him and Hazlewood.
&quot;With all my heart,&quot; said the Colonel and, ringing the bell, gave the necessary orders.
&quot;I trust so too, Mr. Sampson,&quot; said Pleydell; &quot;but we must use the means; and I am afraid we shall have more difficulty in procuring them than I at first thought.--But a faint heart never won a fair lady--and, by the way (apart to Miss Mannering, while Bertram was engaged with his sister), there&#39;s a vindication of Holland for you!
Adieu, young folks: Miss Julia, keep your heart till I come back again--let there be nothing done to prejudice my right, whilst I am non volens agere.&quot;
replied the counsellor &quot;I will not give up one hair of his head, though I should follow them to the court of last resort in his behalf--but what signified mooting points and showing one&#39;s hand to that old ass?
&quot;The house of our ancestors is at present the habitation of a wretch as insidious as dangerous, whose arts and villainy accomplished the ruin and broke the heart of our unhappy father.&quot;
He maun take part wi&#39; hand and heart; and weel his part it is, for redding his quarrel might have cost you dear,&quot; &quot;Troth, Luckie, it&#39;s very true,&quot; said the steady farmer; &quot;and ere I turn back frae the Captain&#39;s side, I&#39;ll show that I haena forgotten&#39;t.&quot;
He pressed his sister&#39;s hand, and took a yet more affectionate farewell of Julia with his eyes.
Even in winter it was a sheltered and snugly sequestered spot; but when arrayed in the verdure of spring, the earth sending forth all its wild flowers, the shrubs spreading their waste of blossom around it, and the weeping birches, which towered over the underwood, drooping their long and leafy fibres to intercept the sun, it must have seemed a place for a youthful poet to study his earliest sonnet, or a pair of lovers to exchange their first mutual avowal of affection.
The steel heart of the bold yeoman had well-nigh given way, and he suppressed with difficulty a shout, which, in the defenceless posture and situation which they then occupied, might have cost all their lives.
&quot;Reserve them for the harpsichord, my love,&quot; said the counsellor.
The Dominie then pressed forward, grinned, chuckled, made a diabolical sound in attempting to whistle, and finally, unable to stifle his emotions, ran away to empty the feelings of his heart at his eyes.
We shall not attempt to describe the expansion of heart and glee of this happy evening.
he broke out, &quot;how could there be a foot-mark on the ground, when it was a frost as hard as the heart of a Memel log?&quot;
&quot;Why, I say,&quot; replied Glossin, &quot;and I believe that gentleman (looking at Hatteraick) knows, that the young man is the natural son of the late Ellangowan, by a girl called Janet Lightoheel, who was afterwards married to Hewit the shipwright, that lived in the neighbourhood of Annan.
Unfit to live or die--O marble heart!
Mr. Pleydell had left the party for some time; but he returned, according to promise, during the Christmas recess of the courts.
You must know, that one of the requisites to be a macer, or officer in attendance upon our supreme court, is, that they shall be men of no knowledge.&quot;
&quot;Now, our Scottish legislature, for the joke&#39;s sake I suppose, have constituted those men of no knowledge into a peculiar court for trying questions of relationship and descent, such as this business of Bertram, which often involve the most nice and complicated questions of evidence.&quot;
[*The singular inconsistency hinted at is now, in a great degree, removed] However, this Saturnalian court has done our business; and a glorious batch of claret we had afterwards at Walker&#39;s.

Strangers who visit this place, the scenery of which is highly romantic, are also shown, under the name of the Gauger&#39;s Loup, a tremendous precipice, being the same, it is asserted, from which Kennedy was precipitated.
He had been seventeen times lawfully married; and besides such a reason ably large share of matrimonial comforts, was, after his hundredth year, the avowed father of four children, by less legitimate affections.
The fatal bonnet lay on the table of the court; Bargally swore that it was the identical article worn by the man who robbed him; and he and others likewise deponed that they had found the accused on the spot where the crime was committed, with the bonnet on his head.
But there was a person in the court who knew well both who did, and who did not, commit, the crime.

One witness “declared also That the said Alan Breck threatened that he would challenge Ballieveolan and his sons to fight because of his removing the declarant last year from Glenduror.” On another page: “Duncan Campbell, change-keeper at Annat, aged thirty-five years, married, witness cited, sworn, purged and examined ut supra, depones, That, in the month of April last, the deponent met with Alan Breck Stewart, with whom he was not acquainted, and John Stewart, in Auchnacoan, in the house of the walk miller of Auchofragan, and went on with them to the house: Alan Breck Stewart said, that he hated all the name of Campbell; and the deponent said, he had no reason for doing so: But Alan said, he had very good reason for it: that thereafter they left that house; and, after drinking a dram at another house, came to the deponent’s house, where they went in, and drunk some drams, and Alan Breck renewed the former Conversation; and the deponent, making the same answer, Alan said, that, if the deponent had any respect for his friends, he would tell them, that if they offered to turn out the possessors of Ardshiel’s estate, he would make black cocks of them, before they entered into possession by which the deponent understood shooting them, it being a common phrase in the country.” Some time after the publication of Kidnapped we stopped for a short while in the Appin country, where we were surprised and interested to discover that the feeling concerning the murder of Glenure (the “Red Fox,” also called “Colin Roy”) was almost as keen as though the tragedy had taken place the day before.
He married Cameron Daughter to Ewen Cameron of Lochiel.” Following this is a paragraph stating that “John Stewart 1st of Ardsheall of his descendants Alan Breck had better be omitted.
If it is strange for me to look back from a distance both in time and space on these bygone adventures of our youth, it must be stranger for you who tread the same streets--who may to-morrow open the door of the old Speculative, where we begin to rank with Scott and Robert Emmet and the beloved and inglorious Macbean--or may pass the corner of the close where that great society, the L. J. R., held its meetings and drank its beer, sitting in the seats of Burns and his companions.
Lastly, to put all the elements of this affair before you, here is the testamentary letter itself, superscrived by the own hand of our departed brother.” He gave me the letter, which was addressed in these words: “To the hands of Ebenezer Balfour, Esquire, of Shaws, in his house of Shaws, these will be delivered by my son, David Balfour.” My heart was beating hard at this great prospect now suddenly opening before a lad of seventeen years of age, the son of a poor country dominie in the Forest of Ettrick.
It is good against the Gout; it comforts the heart and strengthens the memory; and the flowers, put into a Glasse, close stopt, and set into ane hill of ants for a month, then take it out, and you will find a liquor which comes from the flowers, which keep in a vial; it is good, ill or well, and whether man or woman.” And then, in the minister’s own hand, was added: “Likewise for sprains, rub it in; and for the cholic, a great spooneful in the hour.” To be sure, I laughed over this; but it was rather tremulous laughter; and I was glad to get my bundle on my staff’s end and set out over the ford and up the hill upon the farther side; till, just as I came on the green drove-road running wide through the heather, I took my last look of Kirk Essendean, the trees about the manse, and the big rowans in the kirkyard where my father and my mother lay.
There was a flag upon the castle, and ships moving or lying anchored in the firth; both of which, for as far away as they were, I could distinguish clearly; and both brought my country heart into my mouth.
My heart sank.
At last the sun went down, and then, right up against the yellow sky, I saw a scroll of smoke go mounting, not much thicker, as it seemed to me, than the smoke of a candle; but still there it was, and meant a fire, and warmth, and cookery, and some living inhabitant that must have lit it; and this comforted my heart.
The door, as well as I could see it in the dim light, was a great piece of wood all studded with nails; and I lifted my hand with a faint heart under my jacket, and knocked once.
“Your father was very fond of his meat, I mind; he was a hearty, if not a great eater; but as for me, I could never do mair than pyke at food.” He took a pull at the small beer, which probably reminded him of hospitable duties, for his next speech ran thus: “If ye’re dry ye’ll find water behind the door.” To this I returned no answer, standing stiffly on my two feet, and looking down upon my uncle with a mighty angry heart.
That’s where the mistake is.” He sat awhile and shook, blinking in his plate: “He was all the brother that ever I had,” he added, but with no heart in his voice; and then he caught up his spoon and fell to supper again, but still shaking.
Now this last passage, this laying of hands upon my person and sudden profession of love for my dead father, went so clean beyond my comprehension that it put me into both fear and hope.
For why should my uncle play a part with a relative that came, almost a beggar, to his door, unless in his heart he had some cause to fear him?
When I was called in again, my uncle counted out into my hand seven and thirty golden guinea pieces; the rest was in his hand, in small gold and silver; but his heart failed him there, and he crammed the change into his pocket.
Minding my uncle’s word about the bannisters, I kept close to the tower side, and felt my way in the pitch darkness with a beating heart.
I thought; and with the thought, a gust of a kind of angry courage came into my heart.
But I knew what I wanted now, and turned and groped my way down again, with a wonderful anger in my heart.
Once there, I believed I could force on the visit to the lawyer, even if my uncle were now insincere in proposing it; and, perhaps, in the bottom of my heart, I wished a nearer view of the sea and ships.
After all I had listened to upon the way, I looked at that ship with an extreme abhorrence; and from the bottom of my heart I pitied all poor souls that were condemned to sail in her.
“In all that time, sir, ye should have learned to know me: I’m a stiff man, and a dour man; but for what ye say the now--fie, fie!--it comes from a bad heart and a black conscience.
It made my heart bleed; but the men had a great respect for the chief mate, who was, as they said, “the only seaman of the whole jing-bang, and none such a bad man when he was sober.” Indeed, I found there was a strange peculiarity about our two mates: that Mr. Riach was sullen, unkind, and harsh when he was sober, and Mr. Shuan would not hurt a fly except when he was drinking.
And a change I was to get, as you shall hear; but I must first tell of a conversation I had with Mr. Riach, which put a little heart in me to bear my troubles.
“And in the meantime,” says he, “keep your heart up.
He was a married man, with a wife in Leith; but whether or no he had a family, I have now forgotten; I hope not.
Mr. Riach, perhaps from caution, would never suffer me to say another word about my story; the captain, whom I tried to approach, rebuffed me like a dog and would not hear a word; and as the days came and went, my heart sank lower and lower, till I was even glad of the work which kept me from thinking.
Now, sir, I was for France; and there was a French ship cruising here to pick me up; but she gave us the go-by in the fog--as I wish from the heart that ye had done yoursel’!
My chest was tight, my mouth dry, the light dark to my eyes; the thought of the numbers that were soon to leap in upon us kept my heart in a flutter: and the sea, which I heard washing round the brig, and where I thought my dead body would be cast ere morning, ran in my mind strangely.
I, on my part, clambered up into the berth with an armful of pistols and something of a heavy heart, and set open the window where I was to watch.
I do not know if I was what you call afraid; but my heart beat like a bird’s, both quick and little; and there was a dimness came before my eyes which I continually rubbed away, and which continually returned.
“Come to my arms!” he cried, and embraced and kissed me hard upon both cheeks.
“David,” said he, “I love you like a brother.
Alan, indeed, expressed himself most lovingly; and taking a knife from the table, cut me off one of the silver buttons from his coat.
Mr. Riach, as I do not think he had been very forward in the battle, so he had got off with nothing worse than a blow upon the cheek: but he looked out of heart and very weary, having been all night afoot, either standing watch or doctoring the wounded.
A little after, the captain came (as was agreed) to one of the windows, and stood there in the rain, with his arm in a sling, and looking stern and pale, and so old that my heart smote me for having fired upon him.
But the heart of the matter is the business of my chief, Ardshiel.” “I thought they called your chief Appin,” said I.
Now, the tenants of Appin have to pay a rent to King George; but their hearts are staunch, they are true to their chief; and what with love and a bit of pressure, and maybe a threat or two, the poor folk scrape up a second rent for Ardshiel.
That was the love the clansmen bore their chief.
And, thinks he, in his black heart, ‘I’ll soon get other tenants that’ll overbid these Stewarts, and Maccolls, and Macrobs’ (for these are all names in my clan, David); ‘and then,’ thinks he, ‘Ardshiel will have to hold his bonnet on a French roadside.’” “Well,” said I, “what followed?” Alan laid down his pipe, which he had long since suffered to go out, and set his two hands upon his knees.
“Ochone, David,” says he, “this is no the kind of death I fancy!” “What, Alan!” I cried, “you’re not afraid?” “No,” said he, wetting his lips, “but you’ll allow, yourself, it’s a cold ending.” By this time, now and then sheering to one side or the other to avoid a reef, but still hugging the wind and the land, we had got round Iona and begun to come alongside Mull.
The sea was here quite quiet; there was no sound of any surf; the moon shone clear; and I thought in my heart I had never seen a place so desert and desolate.
I used to watch this smoke, when I was wet and cold, and had my head half turned with loneliness; and think of the fireside and the company, till my heart burned.
My clothes were beginning to rot; my stockings in particular were quite worn through, so that my shanks went naked; my hands had grown quite soft with the continual soaking; my throat was very sore, my strength had much abated, and my heart so turned against the horrid stuff I was condemned to eat, that the very sight of it came near to sicken me.
I could not believe such wickedness, and ran along the shore from rock to rock, crying on them piteously even after they were out of reach of my voice, I still cried and waved to them; and when they were quite gone, I thought my heart would have burst.
The next time I counted the full thousand, as slowly as I could, my heart beating so as to hurt me.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Indeed I was by far in better heart and health of body at the end of that long tramp than I had been at the beginning.
Yet nearer, and there began to come to our ears a great sound of mourning, the people on board and those on the shore crying and lamenting one to another so as to pierce the heart.
“If it is all fear upon both sides, I care to hear no more of it.” “Na,” said Mr. Henderland, “but there’s love too, and self-denial that should put the like of you and me to shame.
And now the wounded man looked from one to another with scared eyes, and there was a change in his voice, that went to the heart.
He was posted here to hold us in talk.” At that word (which I could hear quite plainly, though it was to the soldiers and not to me that he was crying it) my heart came in my mouth with quite a new kind of terror.
The pace was deadly: my heart seemed bursting against my ribs; and I had neither time to think nor breath to speak with.
“The innocent should surely come before the guilty.” “Why, David,” said he, “the innocent have aye a chance to get assoiled in court; but for the lad that shot the bullet, I think the best place for him will be the heather.
Of all deaths, I would truly like least to die by the gallows; and the picture of that uncanny instrument came into my head with extraordinary clearness (as I had once seen it engraved at the top of a pedlar’s ballad) and took away my appetite for courts of justice.
“But for this lad that has come here and seen us at our worst, and seen the goodman fleeching like a suitor, him that by rights should give his commands like any king--as for you, my lad,” she says, “my heart is wae not to have your name, but I have your face; and as long as my heart beats under my bosom, I will keep it, and think of it, and bless it.” And with that she kissed me, and burst once more into such sobbing, that I stood abashed.
I was by this time afraid of but one thing in the world; and that was to be set back upon the rock; anything else was welcome to me; so we got ourselves at once in marching order, and began to slip from rock to rock one after the other, now crawling flat on our bellies in the shade, now making a run for it, heart in mouth.
“With all my heart,” says I; “and if he finds it, what is he to think?” “Well,” says Alan, “I wish he was a man of more penetration, for by my troth I am afraid he will make little enough of it!
“But then John Breck will see the sprig of birch and the sprig of pine; and he will say to himsel’ (if he is a man of any penetration at all, which I misdoubt), ALAN WILL BE LYING IN A WOOD WHICH IS BOTH OF PINES AND BIRCHES.
“Your affectionate cousin, “A.
“There are whiles,” said he, “when ye are altogether too canny and Whiggish to be company for a gentleman like me; but there come other whiles when ye show yoursel’ a mettle spark; and it’s then, David, that I love ye like a brother.” The mist rose and died away, and showed us that country lying as waste as the sea; only the moorfowl and the pewees crying upon it, and far over to the east, a herd of deer, moving like dots.
My head was nearly turned with fear and shame; and at what I saw, when I looked out around me on the moor, my heart was like dying in my body.
The aching and faintness of my body, the labouring of my heart, the soreness of my hands, and the smarting of my throat and eyes in the continual smoke of dust and ashes, had soon grown to be so unbearable that I would gladly have given up.
But, dear heart have mercy!
But my good companion had nothing in his mind but kindness; and the next moment, two of the gillies had me by the arms, and I began to be carried forward with great swiftness (or so it appeared to me, although I dare say it was slowly enough in truth), through a labyrinth of dreary glens and hollows and into the heart of that dismal mountain of Ben Alder.
By this manner of living, and thanks to the affection of his clan, he had not only stayed all this time in safety, while so many others had fled or been taken and slain: but stayed four or five years longer, and only went to France at last by the express command of his master.
I do not know if the collops were truly very good, but my heart rose against the sight of them, and I could eat but little.
It was a grey day with a cool, mild air: and I sat in a dream all morning, only disturbed by the passing by of Cluny’s scouts and servants coming with provisions and reports; for as the coast was at that time clear, you might almost say he held court openly.
It would be a fine, handsome, generous thing, indeed, for Alan to turn round and say to me: “Go, I am in the most danger, and my company only increases yours.” But for me to turn to the friend who certainly loved me, and say to him: “You are in great danger, I am in but little; your friendship is a burden; go, take your risks and bear your hardships alone----” no, that was impossible; and even to think of it privily to myself, made my cheeks to burn.
Alan gave way at last, but with only half a heart.
My head was light perhaps; but I began to love the prospect, I began to glory in the thought of such a death, alone in the desert, with the wild eagles besieging my last moments.
And at each of Alan’s taunts, I hugged myself.
O, let me get into the bield of a house--I’ll can die there easier.” I had no need to pretend; whether I chose or not, I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart of stone.
In my heart, I liked ye fine--even when I was the angriest.” “Wheesht, wheesht!” cried Alan.
But whether because he was a very good doctor, or I a very young, strong man, I lay bedridden for no more than a week, and before a month I was able to take the road again with a good heart.
I need not say if I was pleased to see him; Mrs. Maclaren, our hostess, thought nothing good enough for such a guest; and as Duncan Dhu (which was the name of our host) had a pair of pipes in his house, and was much of a lover of music, this time of my recovery was quite a festival, and we commonly turned night into day.
He was sought upon all sides on a charge of carrying a young woman from Balfron and marrying her (as was alleged) by force; yet he stepped about Balquhidder like a gentleman in his own walled policy.
“Ay, ye can blow” said Alan; and taking the instrument from his rival, he first played the same spring in a manner identical with Robin’s; and then wandered into variations, which, as he went on, he decorated with a perfect flight of grace-notes, such as pipers love, and call the “warblers.” I had been pleased with Robin’s playing, Alan’s ravished me.
It would go against my heart to haggle a man that can blow the pipes as you can!” Thereupon that quarrel was made up; all night long the brose was going and the pipes changing hands; and the day had come pretty bright, and the three men were none the better for what they had been taking, before Robin as much as thought upon the road.
Over there, there’s all that heart could want waiting me; and the birds go over, and the boats go over--all that please can go, but just me only!
“I don’t want the lass to fall in love with ye, I want her to be sorry for ye, David; to which end there is no manner of need that she should take you for a beauty.
For all that, if ye have any affection for my neck (to say nothing of your own) ye will perhaps be kind enough to take this matter responsibly.
The maid appeared surprised (as well she might be) at our speedy return; but Alan had no words to spare for her in explanation, helped me to a chair, called for a tass of brandy with which he fed me in little sips, and then breaking up the bread and cheese helped me to eat it like a nursery-lass; the whole with that grave, concerned, affectionate countenance, that might have imposed upon a judge.
She had trusted no one with our affairs, not even her sweetheart, if she had one; but as soon as her father was asleep, had left the house by a window, stolen a neighbour’s boat, and come to our assistance single-handed.
I was abashed how to find expression for my thanks; but she was no less abashed at the thought of hearing them; begged us to lose no time and to hold our peace, saying (very properly) that the heart of our matter was in haste and silence; and so, what with one thing and another, she had set us on the Lothian shore not far from Carriden, had shaken hands with us, and was out again at sea and rowing for Limekilns, before there was one word said either of her service or our gratitude.
For my part, I could say nothing, she was so simple a creature that my heart smote me both with remorse and fear: remorse because we had traded upon her ignorance; and fear lest we should have anyway involved her in the dangers of our situation.
I told him I was come to the Queensferry on business, and taking heart of grace, asked him to direct me to the house of Mr. Rankeillor.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Through all the rest of my story Alan was Mr. Thomson; which amused me the more, as it was a piece of policy after his own heart.
For,” says he, really with embarrassment, “the matter hinges on a love affair.” “Truly,” said I, “I cannot very well join that notion with my uncle.” “But your uncle, Mr. David, was not always old,” replied the lawyer, “and what may perhaps surprise you more, not always ugly.
However, majora canamus--the two lads fell in love, and that with the same lady.
Mr. Ebenezer, who was the admired and the beloved, and the spoiled one, made, no doubt, mighty certain of the victory; and when he found he had deceived himself, screamed like a peacock.
The kidnapping, to be sure, would be a court card upon our side, if we could only prove it.
“The great affair,” I asked, “is to bring home to him the kidnapping?” “Surely,” said Mr. Rankeillor, “and if possible, out of court.
Even as I spoke on these grave subjects, my eye would take a glad bit of a run over the prospect, and my heart jump with pride.
Alan and I went slowly forward upon our way, having little heart either to walk or speak.
But as I went on my way to the city, I felt so lost and lonesome, that I could have found it in my heart to sit down by the dyke, and cry and weep like any baby.

sense_and_sensibility

The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence.
By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present lady, three daughters.
By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his wealth.
He meant not to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.
Had he married a more amiable woman, he might have been made still more respectable than he was:—he might even have been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and very fond of his wife.
The prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income, besides the remaining half of his own mother’s fortune, warmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.
No one could dispute her right to come; the house was her husband’s from the moment of his father’s decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood’s situation, with only common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;—but in _her_ mind there was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of immovable disgust.
So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother.
She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.
Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne’s romance, without having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.
It was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages; and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his money to his half sisters?
Your sisters will marry, and it will be gone for ever.
If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds.” “That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives, rather than for them—something of the annuity kind I mean.—My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.
It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.” “I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year.
Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.
For their brother’s sake, too, for the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity.
The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character, which half a year’s residence in her family afforded; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according to the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters’ continuance at Norland.
It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable, that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.
He was too diffident to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome, his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.
I love him already.” “I think you will like him,” said Elinor, “when you know more of him.” “Like him!” replied her mother with a smile.
She speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all her established ideas of what a young man’s address ought to be, was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate.
No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to Elinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.
Mama, how shall we do without her?” “My love, it will be scarcely a separation.
You will gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother.
I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward’s heart.
Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly.
He admires as a lover, not as a connoisseur.
But it would have broke _my_ heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.
Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love.
He must have all Edward’s virtues, and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm.” “Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.
He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother.
When you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do in his heart.” Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.
Believe them to be stronger than I have declared; believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion—the hope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly.
In my heart I feel little—scarcely any doubt of his preference.
What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny’s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank.” Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth.
A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection.
She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to her so expressively of her brother’s great expectations, of Mrs. Ferrars’s resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to _draw him in;_ that Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm.
She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations.
To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter-in-law’s guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress.
A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find none in accommodating them.” She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection.
Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved.
A small green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it.
In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor.
The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to be charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music, although by her mother’s account, she had played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.
She had only two daughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world.
She was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood.
Mrs. Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge; and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl.
Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be _my_ father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must have long outlived every sensation of the kind.
But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I should not think Colonel Brandon’s being thirty-five any objection to his marrying _her_.” “A woman of seven and twenty,” said Marianne, after pausing a moment, “can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the provision and security of a wife.
In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable.
In my eyes it would be no marriage at all, but that would be nothing.
To me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other.” “It would be impossible, I know,” replied Elinor, “to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.
In Edward’s farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both.
“But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance?
he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles.” CHAPTER X. Marianne’s preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries.
He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John’s account of him and her own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him.
I have erred against every common-place notion of decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful—had I talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have been spared.” “My love,” said her mother, “you must not be offended with Elinor—she was only in jest.
Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners.
He was exactly formed to engage Marianne’s heart, for with all this, he joined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own, and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.
In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support.
Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.
Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction, were now actually excited by her sister; and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon.
That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice no expression.” “You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,” replied Elinor, “and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the commendation _I_ am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid.
In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving, in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her affection.
To her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind.
Her heart was devoted to Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home.
Her heart was not so much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure.
Her admiration and regard, even her sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his attentions were wholly Marianne’s, and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing.
Elinor’s compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.
I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment’s being pardonable.” “This,” said he, “cannot hold; but a change, a total change of sentiments—No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous!
The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.
But by an appeal to her affection for her mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly subdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next, that it must be declined.
I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.” “You have said so,” replied Elinor, “almost every day since they first met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle.” “But indeed this is quite another thing.
I am sure they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.” “Take care, Margaret.
Last night after tea, when you and mama went out of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper; and put it into his pocket-book.” For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not withhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.
Come, come, this won’t do, Colonel; so let us hear the truth of it.” “My dear madam,” said Lady Middleton, “recollect what you are saying.” “Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?” said Mrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter’s reproof.
Well, I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain.” So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.
She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reason to believe him rich.
To Marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover’s heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother.
The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his favourite pointer at her feet.
One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood’s happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him.
But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world.
Then, and then only, under such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton.” “I flatter myself,” replied Elinor, “that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this.” “There certainly are circumstances,” said Willoughby, “which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of my affection, which no other can possibly share.” Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she understood him.
Tell me that not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me.” The promise was readily given, and Willoughby’s behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness.
Willoughby’s behaviour in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother’s invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her.
One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;—the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne’s love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.
“Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,” said she, as she sat down to work, “and with how heavy a heart does he travel?” “It is all very strange.
And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?
I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;—but you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can—it will not satisfy _you_, I know; but you shall not talk _me_ out of my trust in it.
You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shown.
Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of?
This is strange indeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness.” “I want no proof of their affection,” said Elinor; “but of their engagement I do.” “I am perfectly satisfied of both.” “Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of them.” “I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly.
Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?
Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate respect?
How is it to be supposed that Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister’s love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his affection;—that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?” “I confess,” replied Elinor, “that every circumstance except _one_ is in favour of their engagement; but that _one_ is the total silence of both on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.” “How strange this is!
He must and does love her I am sure.” “But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him.” “You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this matter as certain.
If you were to see them at the altar, you would suppose they were going to be married.
“I love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me.
Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately, it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case.
It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now be very advisable.” They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.
She played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied.
In books too, as well as in music, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving.
It would be the natural result of your affection for her.
I know Marianne’s heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible.
I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct.” Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister’s youth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood’s romantic delicacy.
Marianne looked again; her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known as Willoughby’s, joined them in begging her to stop, and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.
On Edward’s side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.
He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.
Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself.
for famous you must be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter.” “I shall not attempt it.
But I was willing to show you that I had not forgot our old disputes.” “I love to be reminded of the past, Edward—whether it be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it—and you will never offend me by talking of former times.
You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent—some of it, at least—my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books.” “And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs.” “No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.” “Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life—your opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?” “Undoubtedly.
It was evident that he was unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.
But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward’s affection, to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton, and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger.
That her sister’s affections _were_ calm, she dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, in spite of this mortifying conviction.
The closing of the little gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the door.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“My love, have you been asleep?” said his wife, laughing.
“Oh, my love,” cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, who just then entered the room—“you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter.” Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies, began complaining of the weather.
“My love you contradict every body,” said his wife with her usual laugh.
It will be quite delightful!—My love,” applying to her husband, “don’t you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?” “Certainly,” he replied, with a sneer—“I came into Devonshire with no other view.” “There now,”—said his lady, “you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you cannot refuse to come.” They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.
I know why you inquire about him, very well; your sister is to marry him.
When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; and so we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and another, and I said to him, ‘So, Colonel, there is a new family come to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty, and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna.
Mama says _he_ was in love with your sister too.
I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly ever falls in love with any body.” “Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?” said Elinor.
And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married!
It is a sweet place, by all accounts.” “You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?” “Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.
But mama did not think the match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel, and we should have been married immediately.” “Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John’s proposal to your mother before it was made?
Had he never owned his affection to yourself?” “Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have liked it of all things.
With her children they were in continual raptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.
Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust.
The mother’s consternation was excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and every thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer.
She was seated in her mother’s lap, covered with kisses, her wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other.
I never saw such fine children in my life.—I declare I quite doat upon them already, and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children.” “I should guess so,” said Elinor, with a smile, “from what I have witnessed this morning.” “I have a notion,” said Lucy, “you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see children full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet.” “I confess,” replied Elinor, “that while I am at Barton Park, I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence.” A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss Steele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now said rather abruptly, “And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?
I suppose your brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was so rich?” “Upon my word,” replied Elinor, “I cannot tell you, for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.
But this I can say, that if he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him.” “Oh!
one never thinks of married men’s being beaux—they have something else to do.” “Lord!
Sir John could do no more; but he did not know that any more was required: to be together was, in his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being established friends.
“’Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure,” said she, “and I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome.
I was very unwilling to enter into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so prudent as I ought to have been.
Though you do not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.” “Certainly,” answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after a moment’s reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward’s honour and love, and her companion’s falsehood—“Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!—I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me, that really—I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name.
I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke.” Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very compassionate.
This picture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward’s gift; but a correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she was almost overcome—her heart sunk within her, and she could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for the time complete.
Their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward’s visit near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own prospects, his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had often surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partiality could set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.—Her resentment of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time made her feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations, soon arose.
Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart?
His affection was all her own.
He certainly loved her.
What a softener of the heart was this persuasion!
Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his affection for herself out of the question, with his integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a wife like her—illiterate, artful, and selfish?
The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding years—years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the understanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education, while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.
If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his difficulties from his mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likely to be, when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.
These difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness, could be felt as a relief!
And so well was she able to answer her own expectations, that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house.
On the contrary it was a relief to her, to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself, and which was more than she felt equal to support.
But indeed, while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof.
She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival’s intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was unwounded.
And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and then I hope she will not much mind it.” This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied, “Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have been at my filigree already.
“Dear little soul, how I do love her!” “You are very kind,” said Lady Middleton to Elinor; “and as you really like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber, or will you take your chance now?” Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by a little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to practise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time.
I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.” “Thank you,” cried Lucy warmly, “for breaking the ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday.” “Offended me!
If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure.” “Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it.
Your case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them.
Mr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.” “He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to marry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh.
I have been always used to a very small income, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her.
With almost every other man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect; but Edward’s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know.” “That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your’s.
“Edward’s love for me,” said Lucy, “has been pretty well put to the test, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and it has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now.
That would be enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest.” “I should always be happy,” replied Elinor, “to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?
He will be there in February, otherwise London would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.” Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the first rubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end, to which both of them submitted without any reluctance, for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which sincere affection on _her_ side would have given, for self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary.
I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I _do_ beg you will favour me with your company, for I’ve quite set my heart upon it.
I am sure your mother will not object to it; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you; and if I don’t get one of you at least well married before I have done with you, it shall not be my fault.
On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of their declining the offer upon _her_ account; insisted on their both accepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usual cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all, from this separation.
Do not let me hear a word about the expense of it.” “My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings’s heart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or whose protection will give us consequence.” “That is very true,” replied her mother, “but of her society, separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing at all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton.” “If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings,” said Marianne, “at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation.
But these objections had all, with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby’s constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect, how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne’s situation to have the same animating object in view, the same possibility of hope.
Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings’s intimate acquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with them.
Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating all that had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby’s inconstancy, urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him.
He tried to smile as he replied, “your sister’s engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known.” “It cannot be generally known,” returned Elinor, “for her own family do not know it.” He looked surprised and said, “I beg your pardon, I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally talked of.” “How can that be?
By whom can you have heard it mentioned?” “By many—by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons.
Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if concealment be possible, is all that remains.” These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister, affected her very much.
Yet as she was convinced that Marianne’s affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon’s success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she thought it most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say more than she really knew or believed.
She acknowledged, therefore, that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other, of their mutual affection she had no doubt, and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear.
At last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up, and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand to him.
Elinor, who saw as plainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must come from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings’s notice.
Of Elinor’s distress, she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; and calmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said, “Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life!
I hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won’t keep her waiting much longer, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn.
Pray, when are they to be married?” Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment, obliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore, trying to smile, replied, “And have you really, Ma’am, talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister’s being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?
Don’t we all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met?
Elinor drew near, but without saying a word; and seating herself on the bed, took her hand, kissed her affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst of tears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne’s.
Though aware, before she began it, that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm their separation for ever, she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling—so far from the common decorum of a gentleman, as to send a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever—a letter of which every line was an insult, and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy.
In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on the very different mind of a very different person, who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings’s chariot, which she knew had not been ordered till one.
how unhappy I make you!” “I only wish,” replied her sister, “there were any thing I _could_ do, which might be of comfort to you.” This, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne, who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, “Oh!
“Exert yourself, dear Marianne,” she cried, “if you would not kill yourself and all who love you.
if you knew!—And can you believe me to be so, while I see you so wretched!” “Forgive me, forgive me,” throwing her arms round her sister’s neck; “I know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you are—you must be happy; Edward loves you—what, oh what, can do away such happiness as that?” “Many, many circumstances,” said Elinor, solemnly.
“No, no, no,” cried Marianne wildly, “he loves you, and only you.
He has broken no faith with me.” “But he told you that he loved you.” “Yes—no—never absolutely.
“M.D.” That such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have been so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby’s sake, would have been unwilling to believe.
By whom can he have been instigated?” “By all the world, rather than by his own heart.
Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?” Elinor would not contend, and only replied, “Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph, my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits.
Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?
He is to be married very soon—a good-for-nothing fellow!
Well, said I, all I can say is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out.
Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, she could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings’s endeavours to cure a disappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire.
I remember her aunt very well, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man.
Well, it don’t signify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes love to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is ready to have him.
Is she said to be amiable?” “I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day Miss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison could never agree.” “And who are the Ellisons?” “Her guardians, my dear.
I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter, and you know young people like to be laughed at about them.
Mind me, now, if they an’t married by Mid-summer.
But I have just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me leave, I will drink the wine myself.” Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its healing powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister.
Willoughby’s marriage with Miss Grey.
The name of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey—it was no longer to be a secret—it would take place even within a few weeks, with many particulars of preparations and other matters.
and, in some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.” “Ah!” said Colonel Brandon, “there is, indeed!
Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again and again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor’s side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on Marianne’s, as before.
Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings’s entering into her sorrows with any compassion.
Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were together in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower in her estimation; because, through her own weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself, though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill.
Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by Elinor’s application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other, that she wept with agony through the whole of it.
Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne’s letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed, and entreat her directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into the drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings’s going away, remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen, grieving over her for the hardship of such a task, and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother.
The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits.
I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me incapable of having ever felt.
My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.
I had depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one—but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now to lament it.
But can we wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should fall?
The shock which her marriage had given me,” he continued, in a voice of great agitation, “was of trifling weight—was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years afterwards, of her divorce.
He saw her concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect.
Their fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the other be.
She loved the child, and had always kept it with her.
Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt for all your sakes.
Whatever they may have been, however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless _will_ turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which must attend her through life.
You must know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and from my heart believed it might be of service, might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others.” Elinor’s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness; attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.
Eliza had confessed to me, though most reluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he to defend, I to punish his conduct.
She felt the loss of Willoughby’s character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might _once_ have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them.
Design could never bring them in each other’s way: negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of Barton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at first as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain one.
He wished him at the devil with all his heart.
She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify, for it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again, and she should tell everybody she saw, how good-for-nothing he was.” The rest of Mrs. Palmer’s sympathy was shown in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and communicating them to Elinor.
Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day, or twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, “It is very shocking, indeed!” and by the means of this continual though gentle vent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though rather against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her as soon as she married.
He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her sister’s disappointment, by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with confidence.
_These_ assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and _these_ gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make it for him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all.
Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby’s letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married.
The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now hoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, to prevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before.
Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray’s shop.
What is the amount of his fortune?” “I believe about two thousand a year.” “Two thousand a-year;” and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity, he added, “Elinor, I wish with all my heart it were _twice_ as much, for your sake.” “Indeed I believe you,” replied Elinor; “but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying _me_.” “You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken.
In short, it is a kind of thing that”—lowering his voice to an important whisper—“will be exceedingly welcome to _all parties_.” Recollecting himself, however, he added, “That is, I mean to say—your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure you.
And yet it is not very unlikely.” “Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,” said Elinor, with resolution, “going to be married?” “It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation.
Few people of common prudence will do _that_ and whatever she saves, she will be able to dispose of.” “And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters, than to us?” “Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther.
I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond of _you_, but so it happened to strike her.
I question whether Marianne _now_, will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if _you_ do not do better.
I know very little of Dorsetshire; but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors.” Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage by every possible attention.
The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings, and to _her_ she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address, who met her husband’s sisters without any affection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.
Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did not chuse to ask, whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband’s expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.
They were relieved however, not by her own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal when they were together.
But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied, she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly despising them all four.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne’s warmth than she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon’s eyes, as they were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point.
The cold insolence of Mrs. Ferrars’s general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister’s chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to hers, said in a low, but eager, voice, “Dear, dear Elinor, don’t mind them.
She had seen enough of her pride, her meanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise free; and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her _own_ sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars’s creation, preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion.
“Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?—you seem low—you don’t speak;—sure you an’t well.” “I never was in better health.” “I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it.
But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied, “Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to Edward’s love, it is the greatest comfort I have.
Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his sex might make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy’s, nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor’s.
She met him with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister.
are you never to hear yourself praised!—Then you must be no friend of mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to my open commendation.” The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon got up to go away.
was safely delivered of a son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least to all those intimate connections who knew it before.
“They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations.” Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said, “My love, I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power.
Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady Middleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of greater.
I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her.
To have his love used so scornfully!
There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.
She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy.
Edward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she _had_ loved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself!
As for Lucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of Edward for her.
while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your heart?
and yet you loved him!” “Yes.
But I did not love only him; and while the comfort of others was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt.
Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to _her_.” “If such is your way of thinking,” said Marianne, “if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be wondered at.—They are brought more within my comprehension.” “I understand you.
She performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration.—She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard three times to say, “Yes, ma’am.”—She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward’s affection, it cost her only a spasm in her throat.—Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself.
It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that she had asked these young women to her house; merely because she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while your kind friend there, was attending her daughter.
‘I wish, with all my heart,’ says poor Fanny in her affectionate way, ‘that we had asked your sisters instead of them.’” Here he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on.
While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!—such a suspicion could never have entered her head!
Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.
His mother explained to him her liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters grew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he still persisted in this low connection, represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match.
Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear it will be a bad one.” Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor’s heart wrung for the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother’s threats, for a woman who could not reward him.
It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now, at lodgings and taverns.” Elinor’s heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it.
Elinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward’s continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away; and Marianne’s courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor’s conduct and her own.
An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings’s conversation, she was herself left to quiet reflection.
And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother’s Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him.
However this morning he came just as we came home from church; and then it all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have.
I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it.
But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and love, you know, and all that—Oh, la!
So then he was monstrous happy, and talked on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he should take orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he got a living.
Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love when any body else is by?
Edward’s marriage with Lucy was as firmly determined on, and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain, as she had concluded it would be;—every thing depended, exactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment, of which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.
though we have suffered dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy as we must always be in one another’s love.
I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear of our parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my duty required, urge him to it for prudence sake, and would have parted for ever on the spot, would he consent to it; but he said it should never be, he did not regard his mother’s anger, while he could have my affections; our prospects are not very bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for the best; he will be ordained shortly; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow, am very sure you will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too, trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John, or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to assist us.—Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did, but she did it for the best, so I say nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won’t think it too much trouble to give us a call, should she come this way any morning, ’twould be a great kindness, and my cousins would be proud to know her.—My paper reminds me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her, and to Sir John, and Lady Middleton, and the dear children, when you chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne, “I am, &amp;c.” As soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to be its writer’s real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise.
I wish I _could_ get him a living, with all my heart.
It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy’s head and heart great credit.” CHAPTER XXXIX.
As Marianne’s affection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.
What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, that she did not think _that_ any material objection; and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest.
She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor.
The preferment, which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry; and _she_, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!
She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward’s principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another.
“The smallness of the house,” said she, “I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family and income.” By which the Colonel was surprised to find that _she_ was considering Mr. Ferrars’s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation; for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such an income, as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on, and he said so.
“This little rectory _can_ do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.
His marriage must still be a distant good; at least, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.” Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited, nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage.
Few people who have so compassionate a heart!
Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars!” The deception could not continue after this; and an explanation immediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first.
But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy goes to it.” “But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living’s being enough to allow them to marry.” “The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less.
When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all.” “But why should such precaution be used?
Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world.” Elinor was silent.
“We think _now_,”—said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, “of _Robert’s_ marrying Miss Morton.” Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother’s tone, calmly replied,— “The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.” “Choice!—how do you mean?” “I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert.” “Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;—and as to any thing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that one is superior to the other.” Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent.—His reflections ended thus.
After a few moments’ chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister’s being there, quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother’s love and liberality, to the prejudice of his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated course of life, and that brother’s integrity, was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart.
The idea of Edward’s being a clergyman, and living in a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;—and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.
To be sure it was pitiable enough; but upon my soul, I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life, as when it all burst forth.
My mother was the first person who told me of it; and I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution, immediately said to her, ‘My dear madam, I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself, I must say, that if Edward does marry this young woman, _I_ never will see him again.’ That was what I said immediately.
She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to see more of them;—an exertion in which her husband, who attended her into the room, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful.
She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she left no creature behind, from whom it would give her a moment’s regret to be divided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of Lucy’s friendship, she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring Marianne’s peace of mind, and confirming her own.
Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirty from Combe Magna; and before she had been five minutes within its walls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her child to the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through the winding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a distant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering over a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might be seen.
She liked him, however, upon the whole, much better than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;—not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with complacency on the remembrance of Edward’s generous temper, simple taste, and diffident feelings.
But as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head, except by Mrs. Jennings’s suggestion; and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two;—she watched his eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour;—and while his looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne’s feeling, in her head and throat, the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words, entirely escaped the latter lady’s observation;—_she_ could discover in them the quick feelings, and needless alarm of a lover.
Mrs. Jennings, however, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her, declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate, desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her better experience in nursing, of material use.
Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going likewise.—Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister’s account, would be to deprive them both, she thought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, &amp;c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings’s entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence.
Marianne’s ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief, fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.
Her heart was really grieved.
But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood.
Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;—but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words, no smiles.
Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room, and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command than supplication, “Miss Dashwood, for half an hour—for ten minutes—I entreat you to stay.” “No, sir,” she replied with firmness, “I shall _not_ stay.
I mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma— from your sister.” “Is this the real reason of your coming?” “Upon my soul it is,”—was his answer, with a warmth which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself made her think him sincere.
When I first became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.
Your sister’s lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a kind—it is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what _she_ was, that my heart should have been so insensible!
Every year since my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune.
But one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated, because I did not _then_ know what it was to love.
Well may it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to avarice?
To avoid a comparative poverty, which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence, lost every thing that could make it a blessing.” “You did then,” said Elinor, a little softened, “believe yourself at one time attached to her?” “To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such tenderness!
At last, however, my resolution was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone, to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display.
Smith had somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection—but I need not explain myself farther,” he added, looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye,—“your particular intimacy—you have probably heard the whole story long ago.” “I have,” returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him, “I have heard it all.
Her affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return.
But I have injured more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for me (may I say it?)
she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza.
My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her attachment to me—it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased.
I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now.
Well, I went, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was only indifferent.
Did she show it you?” “Yes, I saw every note that passed.” “When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did, for I was in town the whole time,) what I felt is—in the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more simple one—perhaps too simple to raise any emotion—my feelings were very, very painful.—Every line, every word was—in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here, would forbid—a dagger to my heart.
To know that Marianne was in town was—in the same language—a thunderbolt.—Thunderbolts and daggers!—what a reproof would she have given me!—her taste, her opinions—I believe they are better known to me than my own,—and I am sure they are dearer.” Elinor’s heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation, was now softened again;—yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last.
“This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.—Remember that you are married.
The next morning brought another short note from Marianne—still affectionate, open, artless, confiding—everything that could make _my_ conduct most hateful.
With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!
Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read its contents.
Her three notes,—unluckily they were all in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence, and hoarded them for ever,—I was forced to put them up, and could not even kiss them.
She must be attached to you, or she would not have married you.
She knew I had no regard for her when we married.
Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be happy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay.
You have proved your heart less wicked, much less wicked.
Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more gentle, less dignified, forgiveness.
Tell her of my misery and my penitence—tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if you will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever.” “I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called, your justification.
That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen without surprise or resentment.
His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted, he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy.
Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the character, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person and talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a feeling, affectionate temper.
She could not refuse to give him hers;—he pressed it with affection.
She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction, that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge.
Elinor’s heart was full.
As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.
Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.
Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon’s marrying one of you as the object most desirable.
“He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled.
I, you may well believe, could talk of nothing but my child;—he could not conceal his distress; I saw that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy—or rather, not thinking at all, I suppose—giving way to irresistible feelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant, affection for Marianne.
He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since the first moment of seeing her.” Here, however, Elinor perceived,—not the language, not the professions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her mother’s active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose.
“His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or constant—which ever we are to call it—has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne’s unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!—and without selfishness—without encouraging a hope!—could he have seen her happy with another—Such a noble mind!—such openness, such sincerity!—no one can be deceived in _him_.” “Colonel Brandon’s character,” said Elinor, “as an excellent man, is well established.” “I know it is,”—replied her mother seriously, “or after such a warning, _I_ should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to be pleased by it.
But his coming for me as he did, with such active, such ready friendship, is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men.” “His character, however,” answered Elinor, “does not rest on _one_ act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of the case, would have prompted him.
To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long and intimately known; they equally love and respect him; and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired, is very considerable; and so highly do _I_ value and esteem him, that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world.
my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself.
Yet after a time I _did_ say, for at first I was quite overcome, that if she lived, as I trusted she might, my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightful security, I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every encouragement in my power.
Time, a very little time, I tell him, will do everything; Marianne’s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.
He thinks Marianne’s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart again free, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him, was such, as, in Elinor’s conjecture, must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to others; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness, and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.
The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half.
Every thing that the most zealous affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable, was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits.
She, who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, an apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection, must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness.
What in a situation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to—” “How then,” asked her sister, “would you account for his behaviour?” “I would suppose him,—Oh, how gladly would I suppose him, only fickle, very, very fickle.” Elinor said no more.
You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!
To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very attention.
I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?—not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself.—Your example was before me; but to what avail?
No; not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only _that_ heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake.” Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved.
From you, from my home, I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do mix in other society, it will be only to show that my spirit is humbled, my heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.
But it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason, by constant employment.” She paused—and added in a low voice, “If I could but know _his_ heart, everything would become easy.” Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at all nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as reflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself leading to the fact.
A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge one.
As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears, “Tell mama,” withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up stairs.
“Happy with a man of libertine practices!—With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends, and the best of men!—No—my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!—Her conscience, her sensitive conscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt.” Marianne sighed, and repeated, “I wish for no change.” “You consider the matter,” said Elinor, “exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less certain.
Had you married, you must have been always poor.
_Your_ sense of honour and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that—and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?
Beyond _that_, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge _his_ enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart, and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties?” Marianne’s lips quivered, and she repeated the word “Selfish?” in a tone that implied—“do you really think him selfish?” “The whole of his behaviour,” replied Elinor, “from the beginning to the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness.
His circumstances are now unembarrassed—he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself.
But does it follow that had he married you, he would have been happy?—The inconveniences would have been different.
“Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?” “I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma’am, this morning in Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Steele as was.
I happened to look up as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele; so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me, and inquired after you, ma’am, and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars’s, their best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go forwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but howsever, when they come back, they’d make sure to come and see you.” “But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?” “Yes, ma’am.
So, I made free to wish her joy.” “Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?” “Yes, ma’am, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not look up;—he never was a gentleman much for talking.” Elinor’s heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.
She now found, that in spite of herself, she had always admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of all.
But he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery, which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.
That he should be married soon, before (as she imagined) he could be in orders, and consequently before he could be in possession of the living, surprised her a little at first.
They were married, married in town, and now hastening down to her uncle’s.
She saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality, and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;—pursuing her own interest in every thought, courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every wealthy friend.
“I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to hear from him again.
Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes of that daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing, met him with a look of forced complacency, gave him her hand, and wished him joy.
He rose from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not knowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,— “Perhaps you do not know: you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to—to the youngest—to Miss Lucy Steele.” His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor, who sat with her head leaning over her work, in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was.
“Yes,” said he, “they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish.” Elinor could sit it no longer.
Edward, who had till then looked any where, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw—or even heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quitted the room, and walked out towards the village—leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;—a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures.
It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;—and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in need of encouragement and fresh air.
This only need be said;—that when they all sat down to table at four o’clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his lady, engaged her mother’s consent, and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one of the happiest of men.
He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise his spirits.
He was released without any reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;—and elevated at once to that security with another, which he must have thought of almost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire.
His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors confessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four.
I had therefore nothing in the world to do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging.
Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be comfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy, nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and society of both.
Comparisons would occur—regrets would arise; and her joy, though sincere as her love for her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language.
From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, she was every thing by turns but tranquil.
But when the second moment had passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude removed, compared her situation with what so lately it had been,—saw him honourably released from his former engagement,—saw him instantly profiting by the release, to address herself and declare an affection as tender, as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,—she was oppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity; and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better, it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any degree of tranquillity to her heart.
Lucy’s marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all, formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;—and Elinor’s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard.
How they could be thrown together, and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,—a girl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family—it was beyond her comprehension to make out.
To her own heart it was a delightful affair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.
Other designs might afterward arise.” How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally at a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual.
“DEAR SIR, “Being very sure I have long lost your affections, I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another, and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another’s.
“I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,” said Edward.—“For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by _you_ in former days.—In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife!—how I have blushed over the pages of her writing!—and I believe I may say that since the first half year of our foolish—business—this is the only letter I ever received from her, of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style.” “However it may have come about,” said Elinor, after a pause,—“they are certainly married.
She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert’s marrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her.” “She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite.—She will be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner.” In what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew not, for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him.
He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy’s letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the nearest road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct, with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection.
In such a situation as that, where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement?
The connection was certainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration among her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it would be better for her to marry _you_ than be single.” Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than Lucy’s conduct, nor more self-evident than the motive of it.
“Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,” said she; “because—to say nothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect _what_, as you were _then_ situated, could never be.” He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement.
“I was simple enough to think, that because my _faith_ was plighted to another, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour.
They were brought together by mutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain—and they only wanted something to live upon.
Edward had two thousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all that they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life.
But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars’s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert’s offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.
No rumour of Lucy’s marriage had yet reached him:—he knew nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.
Their resemblance in good principles and good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other attraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters fond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate, which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.
came crying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married, on purpose we suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world; so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again.
The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them, was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy’s engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.
Perhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shown to her mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars’s heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children.” This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of Edward.
Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood, by every argument in her power;—told him, that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;—and enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than _three;_ but when she found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she judged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit—and therefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.
With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them, they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their completion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor, as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn.
The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;—could chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.
They had in fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for their cows.
In short, you may as well give her a chance: you understand me.” But though Mrs. Ferrars _did_ come to see them, and always treated them with the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by her real favour and preference.
He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter.
He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of marrying privately without his mother’s consent.
But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages, in self-condemnation for Robert’s offence, and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.
Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken of as an intruder, _she_ was in every thing considered, and always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.
Elinor’s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her.
With such a confederacy against her—with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness—with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself, which at last, though long after it was observable to everybody else—burst on her—what could she do?
She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give her hand to another!—and _that_ other, a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years before, she had considered too old to be married,—and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!
Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him, believed he deserved to be;—in Marianne he was consoled for every past affliction;—her regard and her society restored his mind to animation, and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own happiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend.
Marianne could never love by halves; and her whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had once been to Willoughby.
Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy and rich.
But that he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must not be depended on—for he did neither.
Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover.
Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate; and among the merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked as the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost within sight of each other, they could live without disagreement between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed’s head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him: “Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.” “Lor bless her dear heart, no!” interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.
“Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all on ’em dead except two, and them in the wurkus with me, she’ll know better than to take on in that way, bless her dear heart!
)—My heart alive!
Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.” Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the beadle.
Wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world, sank into the child’s heart for the first time.
They made a great many other wise and humane regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors’ Commons; and, instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a bachelor!
There the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour.
“Well,” said the old gentleman, “I suppose he’s fond of chimney-sweeping?” “He doats on it, your worship,” replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn’t.
sir, don’t, don’t pray be cross to me!” The child beat his hand upon his heart; and looked in his companion’s face, with tears of real agony.
I wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall within him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected.
The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and well-remembered face sank heavily into his heart.
But his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the tall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep.
Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the assurance that “he’d catch it,” condescended to help him.
When I came back, she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they starved her to death.
“Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,” replied Oliver: more as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah.
He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he had borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they had roasted him alive.
His heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back.
If he begged at a farmer’s house, ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about the beadle—which brought Oliver’s heart into his mouth,—very often the only thing he had there, for many hours together.
He had no heart to beg.
Certainly not!” The young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did so.
Mr. Dawkins’s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patron’s interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by the _sobriquet_ of “The Artful Dodger,” Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him.
They crossed from the Angel into St. John’s Road; struck down the small street which terminates at Sadler’s Wells Theatre; through Exmouth Street and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the workhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley-in-the-Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into Saffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace, directing Oliver to follow close at his heels.
“This is him, Fagin,” said Jack Dawkins; “my friend Oliver Twist.” The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the hand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance.
These civilities would probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal exercise of the Jew’s toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them.
They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion of terms, “The Green”: when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying his finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the greatest caution and circumspection.
Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound.
He meant this to be ironical, but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to.
The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two or three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of summary justice, by the back way.
Lie down again; there’s a dear!” With those words, the old lady very gently placed Oliver’s head upon the pillow; and, smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers, and drawing it round his neck.
It makes my heart beat,” added Oliver in a low voice, “as if it was alive, and wanted to speak to me, but couldn’t.” “Lord save us!” exclaimed the old lady, starting; “don’t talk in that way, child.
Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his benefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again; and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow’s heart, being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain.
Any slops, eh?” “He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,” replied Mrs. Bedwin, drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the last word, to intimate that between slops, and broth well compounded, there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever.
A weakness on his part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording— That when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined in the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver’s heels, in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow’s personal property, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need hardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid down as the main-springs of all Nature’s deeds and actions: the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady’s proceedings to matters of maxim and theory: and, by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling.
It was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway.
Master Bates felt it so; and again said, “What do you mean?” The Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering the skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue into his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in a familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down the court.
This was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard, he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish (at all events) to improve upon the distiller’s ingenuity not very far from the old gentleman’s merry heart.
I quite loved it.” “Well, well!” said the old lady, good-humouredly; “you get well as fast as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again.
As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome man, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man, and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a year, that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them.
“Dear heart alive!
The persons on whom I have bestowed my dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections.
“Well, well!” said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful tone, “I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful, perhaps, not to wound me again.
nonsense!” Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr. Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver’s appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the first, to oppose his friend.
“Dot a shoul,” replied Barney; whose words: whether they came from the heart or not: made their way through the nose.
Make him come home, there’s good people, or he’ll kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!” “What the devil’s this?” said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with a white dog at his heels; “young Oliver!
In another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to, unintelligible.
RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other indications of a cattle-market.
“What do you mean, sir?” “I should like,” said the child, “to leave my dear love to poor Oliver Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him.
Bless his heart!
Oliver’s heart sank within him, when he thought of his good friends; it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it might have broken outright.
Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and having his boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of having taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to disturb his reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the nonce, with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his general nature.
“It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,” said Mr. Sikes.
It couldn’t have come about better!” The old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his head and shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy.
Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard.
By degrees, he grew more calm, and besought, in a low and broken voice, that he might be rescued from his present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it might come to him now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt.
But the girl’s voice was in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her, that he had not the heart to utter it.
“Now,” said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, “if you’ll give us something to eat and drink while we’re waiting, you’ll put some heart in us; or in me, at all events.
For the love of all the bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!” The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his hand upon the boy’s mouth, and dragged him to the house.
And then, the noises grew confused in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy’s heart; and he saw or heard no more.
The day afore yesterday, a man—you have been a married woman, ma’am, and I may mention it to you—a man, with hardly a rag upon his back (here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our overseer’s door when he has got company coming to dinner; and says, he must be relieved, Mrs. Corney.
‘My heart!’ says the ungrateful villain, ‘what’s the use of _this_ to me?

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“It’s of no use disguising facts, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble, slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him doubly impressive; “I would drown it myself, with pleasure.” “Then you’re a cruel man,” said the matron vivaciously, as she held out her hand for the beadle’s cup; “and a very hard-hearted man besides.” “Hard-hearted, ma’am?” said Mr. Bumble.
What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?” The beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast; whisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately kissed the matron.
She won’t see it there.” The attendant did as she was told: shaking her head meanwhile, to intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time returned.
“I mind the time,” said the first speaker, “when she would have done the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.” “Ay, that she would,” rejoined the other; “she had a merry heart.
I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck; and the child’s death, perhaps, is on me besides!
Tommy Chitling’s in love!
Here he walked even faster than before; nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court; when, as if conscious that he was now in his proper element, he fell into his usual shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe more freely.
I don’t mind if I have a drop there with you!” But as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was, for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively’s presence.
ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY, MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less become his station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words—trusting that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated—hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at his hands.
He was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs. Corney, hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the other over her heart, and gasped for breath.
She sank into Mr. Bumble’s arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose.
Was it that as frightened you, love?” “It wasn’t anything particular, dear,” said the lady evasively.
“It must have been something, love,” urged Mr. Bumble.
After we’re married, dear.” “After we’re married!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble.
“It wasn’t any impudence from any of them male paupers as—” “No, no, love!” interposed the lady, hastily.
“If I thought it was,” continued Mr. Bumble; “if I thought as any one of ’em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance—” “They wouldn’t have dared to do it, love,” responded the lady.
The dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked hat; and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing, for a few minutes, in the male paupers’ ward, to abuse them a little, with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse-master with needful acerbity.
Assured of his qualifications, Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of his future promotion: which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker.
Come here, Charlotte, and I’ll kiss yer.” “What!” said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room.
“She’s always a-doin’ of it, Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and makes all manner of love!” “Silence!” cried Mr. Bumble, sternly.
“Come back!” Toby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along.
After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged, Oliver: urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die: got upon his feet, and essayed to walk.
Chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into her beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her.
The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known.
“But even if he has been wicked,” pursued Rose, “think how young he is; think that he may never have known a mother’s love, or the comfort of a home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt.
as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have done so, and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him before it is too late!” “My dear love,” said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom, “do you think I would harm a hair of his head?” “Oh, no!” replied Rose, eagerly.
The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King’s subjects, held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence, that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise as they went.
But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words, how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again, he could do something to show his gratitude; only something, which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full; something, however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul.
When the coach turned into it, his heart beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his breath.
Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature’s face; and, carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being.
Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved: may purify our thoughts, and bear down before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it.
With the purest and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest, soul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of that short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment to, himself.
He was still the same gentle, attached, affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength, and when he was dependent for every slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him.
“Rose, my love!” cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over her.
“I don’t know what it is; I can’t describe it; but I feel—” “Not ill, my love?” interposed Mrs. Maylie.
I had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned, for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love.
I have seen enough, too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow; for Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy.
I love her; and He knows how well!” Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself up as she spoke, became composed and firm.
As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a somewhat lighter heart.
Curses on your head, and black death on your heart, you imp!
the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance!
the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety _to be doing something_ to relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time, allay them!
“It is hard,” said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; “so young; so much beloved; but there is very little hope.” Another morning.
Oliver’s heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>How could I ever have know happiness again!” “If that _had_ been the case, Harry,” said Mrs. Maylie, “I fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little import.” “And who can wonder if it be so, mother?” rejoined the young man; “or why should I say, _if?_—It is—it is—you know it, mother—you must know it!” “I know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer,” said Mrs. Maylie; “I know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and lasting.
If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty.” “This is unkind, mother,” said Harry.
Above all, I think” said the lady, fixing her eyes on her son’s face, “that if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and upon his children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against him: he may, no matter how generous and good his nature, one day repent of the connection he formed in early life.
my heart is set, as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman.
Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days.
The window of the young lady’s chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch, which was made up with great care, every morning.
what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart, and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move!
“What I shall have to say, has already presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.” Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness.
that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade in blooming.” There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young heart, claimed kindred naturally, with the loveliest things in nature.
Rose, Rose, to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved you—these were distractions almost too great to bear.
They were mine, by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears, and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in its course.
I have watched you change almost from death, to life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection.
Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has softened my heart to all mankind.” “I did not mean that,” said Rose, weeping; “I only wish you had left here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to pursuits well worthy of you.” “There is no pursuit more worthy of me: more worthy of the highest nature that exists: than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,” said the young man, taking her hand.
For years—for years—I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share; thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy moment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy’s attachment, and claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us!
That time has not arrived; but here, with not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer.” “Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble.” said Rose, mastering the emotions by which she was agitated.
“As you believe that I am not insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.” “It is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?” “It is,” replied Rose, “that you must endeavour to forget me; not as your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply; but, as the object of your love.
“Then you return my love?” said Harry.
“Say but that, dear Rose; say but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!” “If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,” rejoined Rose, “I could have—” “Have received this declaration very differently?” said Harry.
As we have met today, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined; and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper you!” “Another word, Rose,” said Harry.
It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the utterance of a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else.
But the young man caught her to his bosom; and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from the room.
Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse.
But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble’s soul; his heart was waterproof.
I know you pretty well, you see.” “I suppose, a married man,” replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes with his hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident perplexity, “is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can, than a single one.
In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of some kind.
The gate at which they had entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside.
The Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward, attended by Nancy and the boys: Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady’s return.
“I may be too late, even now.” She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl: looking fearfully round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes’s heavy hand upon her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the robber’s lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with noiseless touch, hurried from the house.
Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling.
“It wrings my heart to hear you!” “Heaven bless you for your goodness!” rejoined the girl.
is there no chord in your heart that I can touch!
Is there nothing left, to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!” “When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,” replied the girl steadily, “give away your hearts, love will carry you all lengths—even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers, everything, to fill them.
“Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,” said Rose, stepping gently forward.
Her words and manner had touched Rose Maylie’s heart; and, mingled with her love for her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.
“He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,” said Rose, colouring; “and that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.” “I’m only sixty-one,” said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face.
After performing this evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her without the slightest preface.
Of course, he entered at this juncture, into no explanation of his motives, and they walked on very lovingly together.
Through these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after him; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public-house; now jogging on again, as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose.
Why, you yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.” “Lor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!” exclaimed Charlotte, imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face.
“There, that’ll do: don’t yer be too affectionate, in case I’m cross with yer,” said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity.
You’ve done what’s a very pretty thing, and what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat, that’s so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose—in plain English, the halter!” Mr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not in substance.
“Ay, that he shall,” replied Fagin, “and we’ll have a big-wig, Charley: one that’s got the greatest gift of the gab: to carry on his defence; and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we’ll read it all in the papers—‘Artful Dodger—shrieks of laughter—here the court was convulsed’—eh, Charley, eh?” “Ha!
All the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of ’em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge’s own son making a speech arter dinner—ha!

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Yer never get time enough over yer meals.” “You can talk as you eat, can’t you?” said Fagin, cursing his dear young friend’s greediness from the very bottom of his heart.
One, which advanced with a swift and rapid step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance, accommodated his pace to hers: stopping when she stopped: and as she moved again, creeping stealthily on: but never allowing himself, in the ardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps.
“You will not persist in saying that,” rejoined the gentleman, with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart.
I do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you.
I thought I heard her voice.” “No, my love,” replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back.
As they disappeared, the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears.
Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear of detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all; these were the passionate considerations which, following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart.
“I’d do something in the jail that ’ud get me put in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I’d fall upon you with them in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people.
“You were watched tonight; every word you said was heard.” “Then spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,” rejoined the girl, clinging to him.
“Bill, dear Bill, you cannot have the heart to kill me.
“This is pretty treatment, sir,” said Monks, throwing down his hat and cloak, “from my father’s oldest friend.” “It is because I was your father’s oldest friend, young man,” returned Mr. Brownlow; “it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary, lonely man: it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters’s death-bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would—but Heaven willed otherwise—have made her my young wife; it is because my seared heart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and errors, till he died; it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you gently now—yes, Edward Leeford, even now—and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name.” “What has the name to do with it?” asked the other, after contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the agitation of his companion.
I know that of the wretched marriage, into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole and most unnatural issue.” “I don’t care for hard names,” interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh.
But it rusted and cankered at your father’s heart for years.” “Well, they were separated,” said Monks, “and what of that?” “When they had been separated for some time,” returned Mr. Brownlow, “and your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who, with prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new friends.
“I speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty—for he was, I repeat, a boy, when _his_ father ordered him to marry.
As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love him.
I had no letter, and I never saw him more.” “I went,” said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, “I went, when all was over, to the scene of his—I will use the term the world would freely use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him—of his guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her.
Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in your own words to your accomplice the Jew, ‘_the only proofs of the boy’s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin_.’ Unworthy son, coward, liar,—you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night,—you, whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you,—you, who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father’s heart, and in whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind—you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!” “No, no, no!” returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated charges.
“Make restitution to an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love.
I can see ’em now, not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along amongst ’em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and snarling with their teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon his hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore they’d tear his heart out!” The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro, like one distracted.
He said ‘God bless you’ to me when I ran away,” cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion; “and I will say ‘God bless you’ now, and show him how I love him for it!” As they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds.
They drove straight to the door of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe, and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size); and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as if he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness, and not offering to eat his head—no, not once; not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and maintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and that time fast asleep.
Don’t keep me here.” “This child,” said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his hand upon his head, “is your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who died in giving him birth.” “Yes,” said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy: the beating of whose heart he might have heard.
“His father being taken ill at Rome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long separated, who went from Paris and took me with her—to look after his property, for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor he for her.
He had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery—to be explained one day—prevented his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on, trusting patiently to him, until she trusted too far, and lost what none could ever give her back.
He reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her—prayed her yet to keep it, and wear it next her heart, as she had done before—and then ran on, wildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone distracted.
He did this, he said, to mark his confidence in the mother, and his conviction—only strengthened by approaching death—that the child would share her gentle heart, and noble nature.
If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the money was to come to you: for then, and not till then, when both children were equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed him with coldness and aversion.” “My mother,” said Monks, in a louder tone, “did what a woman should have done.
The girl’s father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate—I love her for it now—could add.
The girl had left her home, in secret, some weeks before; he had searched for her, on foot, in every town and village near; it was on the night when he returned home, assured that she had destroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that his old heart broke.” There was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread of the narrative.
I always loved that boy as if he’d been my—my—my own grandfather,” said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison.
My heart will burst.
“Come, come, my love, remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child!
See here—look, look, my dear!” “Not aunt,” cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck; “I’ll never call her aunt—sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first!
Rose, dear, darling Rose!” Let the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred.
It is a struggle,” said Rose, “but one I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall bear.” “The disclosure of tonight,”—Harry began.
“The disclosure of tonight,” replied Rose softly, “leaves me in the same position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood before.” “You harden your heart against me, Rose,” urged her lover.
“My hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling: every thought in life except my love for you: have undergone a change.
I offer you, now, no distinction among a bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice and detraction, where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame; but a home—a heart and home—yes, dearest Rose, and those, and those alone, are all I have to offer.” “What do you mean!” she faltered.
What is the matter?” It is a world of disappointment: often to the hopes we most cherish, and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour.
FAGIN’S LAST NIGHT ALIVE The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces.
A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself.
They led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard.
“I haven’t one—not one.” “For the love of God,” said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, “do not say that now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are.
Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman’s labours; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home.
Removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver’s warm and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world.
Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how.
On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration, that his mode is the right one.
I would paint her the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively summer group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and her dead sister’s child happy in their love for one another, and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle; I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye.
How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him, more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become—how he traced in him new traits of his early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances, melancholy and yet sweet and soothing—how the two orphans, tried by adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them—these are all matters which need not to be told.
I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be attained.
But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love—the love beyond the grave—of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook.

For all who love shelter and the blessings of the sun, who hate dark weather and perpetual tilting against squalls, there could scarcely be found a more unhomely and harassing place of residence.
Her attraction is romantic in the narrowest meaning of the term.
The birds roost as willingly among the Corinthian capitals as in the crannies of the crag; the same atmosphere and daylight clothe the eternal rock and yesterday&#39;s imitation portico; and as the soft northern sunshine throws out everything into a glorified distinctness--or easterly mists, coming up with the blue evening, fuse all these incongruous features into one, and the lamps begin to glitter along the street, and faint lights to burn in the high windows across the valley--the feeling grows upon you that this also is a piece of nature in the most intimate sense; that this profusion of eccentricities, this dream in masonry and living rock, is not a drop-scene in a theatre, but a city in the world of every-day reality, connected by railway and telegraph-wire with all the capitals of Europe, and inhabited by citizens of the familiar type, who keep ledgers, and attend church, and have sold their immortal portion to a daily paper.
By all the canons of romance, the place demands to be half deserted and leaning towards decay; birds we might admit in profusion, the play of the sun and winds, and a few gipsies encamped in the chief thoroughfare; but these citizens with their cabs and tramways, their trains and posters, are altogether out of key.
Down by yon outlet rode Grahame of Claverhouse and his thirty dragoons, with the town beating to arms behind their horses&#39; tails--a sorry handful thus riding for their lives, but with a man at the head who was to return in a different temper, make a dash that staggered Scotland to the heart, and die happily in the thick of fight.
Here, you come into a court where the children are at play and the grown people sit upon their doorsteps, and perhaps a church spire shows itself above the roofs.

As St. Giles&#39;s must have had in former days a rich and quaint appearance now forgotten, so the neighbourhood was bustling, sunless, and romantic.
Here, for example, is the shape of a heart let into the causeway.
Nor was the vision unsuitable to the locality; for after an hospital, what uglier piece is there in civilisation than a court of law?
I think I see them pause to count the strokes, and wander on again into the moving High Street, stunned and sick at heart.
The broadest of broad Scotch is now banished from the bench; but the courts still retain a certain national flavour.
Besides the courts, there are installed under the same roof no less than three libraries: two of no mean order; confused and semi-subterranean, full of stairs and galleries; where you may see the most studious-looking wigs fishing out novels by lanthorn light, in the very place where the old Privy Council tortured Covenanters.
Many a man&#39;s life has been argued away from him during long hours in the court above.
Ugly actions, above all in ugly places, have the true romantic quality, and become an undying property of their scene.
To a man like Scott, the different appearances of nature seemed each to contain its own legend ready made, which it was his to call forth: in such or such a place, only such or such events ought with propriety to happen; and in this spirit he made the _Lady of the Lake_ for Ben Venue, the _Heart of Midlothian_ for Edinburgh, and the _Pirate_, so indifferently written but so romantically conceived, for the desolate islands and roaring tideways of the North.
[Picture: The Canongate] Here, it is the tale of Begbie the bank-porter, stricken to the heart at a blow and left in his blood within a step or two of the crowded High Street.
A rat scampering within would send a shudder through the stoutest heart.
And surely there are few worse extremes than this extremity of zeal; and few more deplorable defections than this disloyalty to Christian love.
We seem to love for their own sake the emblems of time and the great change; and even around country churches you will find a wonderful exhibition of skulls, and crossbones, and noseless angels, and trumpets pealing for the Judgment Day.
Every mason was a pedestrian Holbein: he had a deep consciousness of death, and loved to put its terrors pithily before the churchyard loiterer; he was brimful of rough hints upon mortality, and any dead farmer was seized upon to be a text.
But his must have been indeed a heart of brass, to lie all day and night alone with the dead persecutor; and other lads were far from emulating him in courage.
Upon what ground, is of small account; if it be only the bishop who was burned for his faith in the antipodes, his memory lightens the heart and makes us walk undisturbed among graves.
I look back with delight on many an escalade of garden walls; many a ramble among lilacs full of piping birds; many an exploration in obscure quarters that were neither town nor country; and I think that both for my companions and myself, there was a special interest, a point of romance, and a sentiment as of foreign travel, when we hit in our excursions on the butt-end of some former hamlet, and found a few rustic cottages embedded among streets and squares.
It was a subterranean passage, although of a larger bore than we were accustomed to in Ainsworth&#39;s novels; and these two words, &#39;subterreanean passage,&#39; were in themselves an irresistible attraction, and seemed to bring us nearer in spirit to the heroes we loved and the black rascals we secretly aspired to imitate.
To scale the Castle Rock from West Princes Street Gardens, and lay a triumphal hand against the rampart itself, was to taste a high order of romantic pleasure.
And when the Spring comes round, and the hawthorns begin to flower, and the meadows to smell of young grass, even in the thickest of our streets, the country hilltops find out a young man&#39;s eyes, and set his heart beating for travel and pure air.
[Picture: Arthur&#39;s Seat] Immediately underneath upon the south, you command the yards of the High School, and the towers and courts of the new Jail--a large place, castellated to the extent of folly, standing by itself on the edge of a steep cliff, and often joyfully hailed by tourists as the Castle.
_Snell_, _blae_, _nirly_, and _scowthering_, are four of these significant vocables; they are all words that carry a shiver with them; and for my part, as I see them aligned before me on the page, I am persuaded that a big wind comes tearing over the Firth from Burntisland and the northern hills; I think I can hear it howl in the chimney, and as I set my face northwards, feel its smarting kisses on my cheek.
Both poverty and a northern climate teach men the love of the hearth and the sentiment of the family; and the latter, in its own right, inclines a poet to the praise of strong waters.
People go by, so drenched and draggle-tailed that I have often wondered how they found the heart to undress.
In a word, life is so unsightly that there are times when the heart turns sick in a man&#39;s inside; and the look of a tavern, or the thought of the warm, fire-lit study, is like the touch of land to one who has been long struggling with the seas.
There is yet another class who do not depend on corporal advantages, but support the winter in virtue of a brave and merry heart.

“But I suppose you are thinking you would like to kiss it?
At evening he had fancifully traced it down the chimney to the spot of its origin—seen the hearth and Bathsheba beside it—beside it in her out-door dress; for the clothes she had worn on the hill were by association equally with her person included in the compass of his affection; they seemed at this early time of his love a necessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called Bathsheba Everdene.
He thoroughly cleaned his silver watch-chain with whiting, put new lacing straps to his boots, looked to the brass eyelet-holes, went to the inmost heart of the plantation for a new walking-stick, and trimmed it vigorously on his way back; took a new handkerchief from the bottom of his clothes-box, put on the light waistcoat patterned all over with sprigs of an elegant flower uniting the beauties of both rose and lily without the defects of either, and used all the hair-oil he possessed upon his usually dry, sandy, and inextricably curly hair, till he had deepened it to a splendidly novel colour, between that of guano and Roman cement, making it stick to his head like mace round a nutmeg, or wet seaweed round a boulder after the ebb.
Because if she would, I should be very glad to marry her.
I ran after you to say (pant) that my aunt made a mistake in sending you away from courting me (pant)——” Gabriel expanded.
“I haven’t a sweetheart at all (pant), and I never had one, and I thought that, as times go with women, it was _such_ a pity to send you away thinking that I had several.” “Really and trewly I am glad to hear that!” said Farmer Oak, smiling one of his long special smiles, and blushing with gladness.
He held out his hand to take hers, which, when she had eased her side by pressing it there, was prettily extended upon her bosom to still her loud-beating heart.
“Yes; you have.” “A man has advanced me money to begin with, but still, it will soon be paid off, and, though I am only an every-day sort of man, I have got on a little since I was a boy.” Gabriel uttered “a little” in a tone to show her that it was the complacent form of “a great deal.” He continued: “When we are married, I am quite sure I can work twice as hard as I do now.” He went forward and stretched out his arm again.
“Why, Farmer Oak,” she said, over the top, looking at him with rounded eyes, “I never said I was going to marry you.” “Well—that _is_ a tale!” said Oak, with dismay.” To run after anybody like this, and then say you don’t want me!” “What I meant to tell you was only this,” she said eagerly, and yet half conscious of the absurdity of the position she had made for herself; “that nobody has got me yet as a sweetheart, instead of my having a dozen, as my aunt said; I _hate_ to be thought men’s property in that way, though possibly I shall be had some day.
But there was no harm in hurrying to correct a piece of false news that had been told you.” “Oh, no—no harm at all.” But there is such a thing as being too generous in expressing a judgment impulsively, and Oak added with a more appreciative sense of all the circumstances—“Well, I am not quite certain it was no harm.” “Indeed, I hadn’t time to think before starting whether I wanted to marry or not, for you’d have been gone over the hill.” “Come,” said Gabriel, freshening again; “think a minute or two.
Will you marry me?
I love you far more than common!” “I’ll try to think,” she observed, rather more timorously; “if I can think out of doors; but my mind spreads away so.” “But you can give a guess.” “Then give me time.” Bathsheba looked thoughtfully into the distance, away from the direction in which Gabriel stood.
He contemplated the red berries between them over and over again, to such an extent, that holly seemed in his after-life to be a cypher signifying a proposal of marriage.
“I don’t want to marry you.” “Try.” “I have tried hard all the time I’ve been thinking; for a marriage would be very nice in one sense.
“Upon my heart and soul, I don’t know what a maid can say stupider than that,” said Oak.
“But dearest,” he continued in a palliative voice, “don’t be like it!” Oak sighed a deep honest sigh—none the less so in that, being like the sigh of a pine plantation, it was rather noticeable as a disturbance of the atmosphere.
“Because I don’t love you.” “Yes, but——” She contracted a yawn to an inoffensive smallness, so that it was hardly ill-mannered at all.
“I don’t love you,” she said.” “But I love you—and, as for myself, I am content to be liked.” “Oh, Mr. Oak—that’s very fine!
“I shall do one thing in this life—one thing certain—that is, love you, and long for you, and _keep wanting you_ till I die.” His voice had a genuine pathos now, and his large brown hands perceptibly trembled.
I am better educated than you—and I don’t love you a bit: that’s my side of the case.
Now yours: you are a farmer just begining, and you ought in common prudence, if you marry at all (which you should certainly not think of doing at present) to marry a woman with money, who would stock a larger farm for you than you have now.” Gabriel looked at her with a little surprise and much admiration.
“After that, do you think I could marry you?
I don’t love you—so ’twould be ridiculous!” she said, with a laugh.
It may have been observed that there is no regular path for getting out of love as there is for getting in.
Some people look upon marriage as a short cut that way, but it has been known to fail.
Separation, which was the means that chance offered to Gabriel Oak by Bathsheba’s disappearance, though effectual with people of certain humours, is apt to idealize the removed object with others—notably those whose affection, placid and regular as it may be, flows deep and long.
It was as remarkable as it was characteristic that the one sentence he uttered was in thankfulness:— “Thank God I am not married: what would _she_ have done in the poverty now coming upon me!” Oak raised his head, and wondering what he could do, listlessly surveyed the scene.
Oak could pipe with Arcadian sweetness, and the sound of the well-known notes cheered his own heart as well as those of the loungers.
So, thinking of his misfortunes, amorous and pastoral, he fell asleep, shepherds enjoying, in common with sailors, the privilege of being able to summon the god instead of having to wait for him.
’Tis said that every night at going to bed she looks in the glass to put on her nightcap properly.” “And not a married woman.
Embarrassed she was not, and she remembered Gabriel’s declaration of love to her at Norcombe only to think she had nearly forgotten it.
A summer eve and loneliness would have been necessary to give the meeting its proper fulness of romance.
Good-night to ye, shepherd.” The bailiff, who showed this nervous dread of loving his neighbours as himself, went up the hill, and Oak walked on to the village, still astonished at the rencontre with Bathsheba, glad of his nearness to her, and perplexed at the rapidity with which the unpractised girl of Norcombe had developed into the supervising and cool woman here.
The voice was unexpectedly attractive; it was the low and dulcet note suggestive of romance; common in descriptions, rare in experience.
Mr. Jan Coggan, who had passed the cup to Henery, was a crimson man with a spacious countenance, and private glimmer in his eye, whose name had appeared on the marriage register of Weatherbury and neighbouring parishes as best man and chief witness in countless unions of the previous twenty years; he also very frequently filled the post of head god-father in baptisms of the subtly-jovial kind.
Yes—mother was concerned to her heart about it—yes.
“My heart died within me, that time; but I kneeled down and said the Lord’s Prayer, and then the Belief right through, and then the Ten Commandments, in earnest prayer.
“What sort of a place is this to live at, and what sort of a mis’ess is she to work under?” Gabriel’s bosom thrilled gently as he thus slipped under the notice of the assembly the innermost subject of his heart.
He was fond enough of her as his sweetheart.” “Used to kiss her in scores and long-hundreds, so ’twas said here and there,” observed Coggan.
“He was very proud of her, too, when they were married, as I’ve been told,” said the maltster.
“He admired his wife so much, that he used to light the candle three time every night to look at her.” “Boundless love; I shouldn’t have supposed it in the world’s universe!” murmered Joseph Poorgrass, who habitually spoke on a large scale in his moral reflections.
The pore feller were faithful and true enough to her in his wish, but his heart would rove, do what he would.
‘Coggan,’ he said, ‘I could never wish for a handsomer woman than I’ve got, but feeling she’s ticketed as my lawful wife, I can’t help my wicked heart wandering, do what I will.’ But at last I believe he cured it by making her take off her wedding-ring and calling her by her maiden name as they sat together after the shop was shut, and so ’a would get to fancy she was only his sweetheart, and not married to him at all.
You see, he might have gone the bad road and given his eyes to unlawfulness entirely—yes, gross unlawfulness, so to say it.” “You see,” said Billy Smallbury, with testimonial emphasis, “the man’s will was to do right, sure enough, but his heart didn’t chime in.” “He got so much better, that he was quite religious in his later years, wasn’t he, Jan?” said Joseph Poorgrass.
“I believe that if so be that Baily Pennyways’ heart were put inside a nutshell, he’d rattle,” continued Henery.
I used not to be so poor as I be now.” “Never mind, heart!” said Mark Clark.
“He can blow the flute very well—that ’a can,” said a young married man, who having no individuality worth mentioning was known as “Susan Tall’s husband.” He continued admiringly, “I’d as lief as not be able to blow into a flute as well as that.” “He’s a clever man, and ’tis a true comfort for us to have such a shepherd,” murmured Joseph Poorgrass, in a soft and complacent cadence.
“Ah, when I and my wife were married at Norcombe Church,” said the old maltster, not pleased at finding himself left out of the subject “we were called the handsomest couple in the neighbourhood—everybody said so.” “Danged if ye bain’t altered now, malster,” said a voice with the vigour natural to the enunciation of a remarkably evident truism.
“Don’t ye play no more shepherd,” said Susan Tall’s husband, the young married man who had spoken once before.
“You used to bide as late as the latest.” “Well, ye see, neighbours, I was lately married to a woman, and she’s my vocation now, and so ye see.
She must have left whilst we were all at the fire.” “I beg yer pardon, but had she any young man courting her in the parish, ma’am?” asked Jacob Smallbury.
“For any lover of hers might have come to the house if he had been a respectable lad.
“Maryann, you go!” said she, fluttering under the onset of a crowd of romantic possibilities.
He’s been courted by sixes and sevens—all the girls, gentle and simple, for miles round, have tried him.
You ought to be married by this time, and not here troubling me.” “Ay, mistress—so I did.
Ah, poor soul of me!” “Did anybody ever want to marry you miss?” Liddy ventured to ask when they were again alone.
‘No, sir—I’m your better,’ or ‘Kiss my foot, sir; my face is for mouths of consequence.’ And did you love him, miss?” “Oh, no.
You’ll stay on working for me?” “For you or anybody that pays me well, ma’am,” replied the young married man.
She was a woman who never, like some newly married, showed conjugal tenderness in public, perhaps because she had none to show.
Well enough, but a poor gawkhammer mortal,” the wife replied “Heh-heh-heh!” laughed the married man with a hideous effort of appreciation, for he was as irrepressibly good-humoured under ghastly snubs as a parliamentary candidate on the hustings.
she cried her heart out about it almost.
It was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity: when, with impressible persons, love becomes solicitousness, hope sinks to misgiving, and faith to hope: when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by, and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise.
The high wall being that of a barrack, and marriage being looked upon with disfavour in the army, assignations and communications had probably been made across the river before tonight.
It makes me say what ought to be said first by you.” “Never mind—say it.” “Oh, must I?—it is, when shall we be married, Frank?” “Oh, I see.
Don’t, dear Frank—will you—for I love you so.
And you said lots of times you would marry me, and—and—I—I—I——” “Don’t cry, now!
She moved between them as a chaise between carts, was heard after them as a romance after sermons, was felt among them like a breeze among furnaces.
It may be said that married men of forty are usually ready and generous enough to fling passing glances at any specimen of moderate beauty they may discern by the way.
Probably, as with persons playing whist for love, the consciousness of a certain immunity under any circumstances from that worst possible ultimate, the having to pay, makes them unduly speculative.
Bathsheba was convinced that this unmoved person was not a married man.
I expect it is simply his nature to be so reserved.” “Simply his nature—I expect so, miss—nothing else in the world.” “Still, ’tis more romantic to think he has been served cruelly, poor thing!
Liddy looking at it said,— “Did you ever find out, miss, who you are going to marry by means of the Bible and key?” “Don’t be so foolish, Liddy.
As if such things could be.” “Well, there’s a good deal in it, all the same.” “Nonsense, child.” “And it makes your heart beat fearfully.
Of love as a spectacle Bathsheba had a fair knowledge; but of love subjectively she knew nothing.
She was a misty shape, and well she might be, considering that her original was at that moment sound asleep and oblivious of all love and letter-writing under the sky.
Do you hear?” “With all my heart, as the old woman said,” replied Mr. Clark, heartily.
All has ended well, and I am happy to say I am going to be married to the young man who has courted me for some time—Sergeant Troy, of the 11th Dragoon Guards, now quartered in Melchester.
A slight romance attaches to him, too.
Soon after she was married to a poor medical man, and while money was forthcoming all went on well.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Boldwood thought her beautiful, but wondered whether he was right in his thought, for it seemed impossible that this romance in the flesh, if so sweet as he imagined, could have been going on long without creating a commotion of delight among men, and provoking more inquiry than Bathsheba had done, even though that was not a little.
His heart began to move within him.
A very handsome girl indeed.” A man is never more credulous than in receiving favourable opinions on the beauty of a woman he is half, or quite, in love with; a mere child’s word on the point has the weight of an R.A.’s.
It was evident that such a nature as his had no attraction for a woman of Bathsheba’s taste.
But Boldwood grew hot down to his hands with an incipient jealousy; he trod for the first time the threshold of “the injured lover’s hell.” His first impulse was to go and thrust himself between them.
Being a woman with some good sense in reasoning on subjects wherein her heart was not involved, Bathsheba genuinely repented that a freak which had owed its existence as much to Liddy as to herself, should ever have been undertaken, to disturb the placidity of a man she respected too highly to deliberately tease.
Had she known Boldwood’s moods, her blame would have been fearful, and the stain upon her heart ineradicable.
It is the usual experience of strong natures when they love.
The insulation of his heart by reserve during these many years, without a duct of any kind for disposable emotion, had worked its effect.
It has been observed more than once that the causes of love are chiefly subjective, and Boldwood was a living testimony to the truth of the proposition.
He became surcharged with the compound, which was genuine lover’s love.
Gabriel had skinned the dead lamb, and was tying the skin over the body of the live lamb, in the customary manner, whilst Bathsheba was holding open a little pen of four hurdles, into which the mother and foisted lamb were driven, where they would remain till the old sheep conceived an affection for the young one.
The cabala of this erotic philosophy seemed to consist of the subtlest meanings expressed in misleading ways.
Bathsheba was no schemer for marriage, nor was she deliberately a trifler with the affections of men, and a censor’s experience on seeing an actual flirt after observing her would have been a feeling of surprise that Bathsheba could be so different from such a one, and yet so like what a flirt is supposed to be.
The great aids to idealization in love were present here: occasional observation of her from a distance, and the absence of social intercourse with her—visual familiarity, oral strangeness.
The smaller human elements were kept out of sight; the pettinesses that enter so largely into all earthly living and doing were disguised by the accident of lover and loved-one not being on visiting terms, and there was hardly awakened a thought in Boldwood that sorry household realities appertained to her, or that she, like all others, had moments of commonplace, when to be least plainly seen was to be most prettily remembered.
He had by this time grown used to being in love; the passion now startled him less even when it tortured him more, and he felt himself adequate to the situation.
Bathsheba immediately contrived to withdraw, and glided along by the river till she was a stone’s throw off: she heard footsteps brushing the grass, and had a consciousness that love was encircling her like a perfume.
“I want you—I want you to let me say I love you again and again!” Bathsheba answered nothing, and the horse upon her arm seemed so impressed, that instead of cropping the herbage she looked up.
“If you can love me, say so, Miss Everdene.
Boldwood, it is painful to have to say I am surprised, so that I don’t know how to answer you with propriety and respect—but am only just able to speak out my feeling—I mean my meaning; that I am afraid I can’t marry you, much as I respect you.
If I have not, and it is not true that you have come unwittingly to me as I have to you, I can say no more.” “I have not fallen in love with you, Mr. Boldwood—certainly I must say that.” She allowed a very small smile to creep for the first time over her serious face in saying this, and the white row of upper teeth, and keenly cut lips already noticed, suggested an idea of heartlessness, which was immediately contradicted by the pleasant eyes.
I will protect and cherish you with all my strength—I will indeed.
I cannot say how far above every other idea and object on earth you seem to me—nobody knows—God only knows—how much you are to me!” Bathsheba’s heart was young, and it swelled with sympathy for the deep-natured man who spoke so simply.
The rarest offerings of the purest loves are but a self-indulgence, and no generosity at all.
Bathsheba, not being the least in love with him, was eventually able to look calmly at his offer.
In every point of view, ranging from politic to passionate, it was desirable that she, a lonely girl, should marry, and marry this earnest, well-to-do, and respected man.
Had she felt, which she did not, any wish whatever for the married state in the abstract, she could not reasonably have rejected him as a woman who frequently appealed to her understanding for deliverance from her whims.
Boldwood as a means to marriage was unexceptionable: she esteemed and liked him: yet she did not want him.
It appears that men take wives because possession is not possible without marriage, and that women accept husbands because marriage is not possible without possession; with totally differing aims the method is the same on both sides.
She said in the same breath that it would be ungenerous not to marry Boldwood, and that she couldn’t do it to save her life.
Peace and war kiss each other at their hours of preparation, sickles, scythes, shears, and pruning-hooks, mingling with swords, bayonets, and lances, in their common necessity for point and edge.
“I mean this, that if Mr. Boldwood really spoke of marriage, I am not going to tell a story and say he didn’t to please you.
She did not know whether to pity him for disappointed love of her, or to be angry with him for having got over it—his tone being ambiguous.
“I said I wanted you just to mention that it was not true I was going to be married to him,” she murmured, with a slight decline in her assurance.
And the outspoken honesty of his character was such that on any subject, even that of her love for, or marriage with, another man, the same disinterestedness of opinion might be calculated on, and be had for the asking.
This is a lover’s most stoical virtue, as the lack of it is a lover’s most venial sin.
In my not marrying you, perhaps!” “Not by any means,” said Gabriel quietly.
Bathsheba would have submitted to an indignant chastisement for her levity had Gabriel protested that he was loving her at the same time; the impetuosity of passion unrequited is bearable, even if it stings and anathematizes—there is a triumph in the humiliation, and a tenderness in the strife.
Bathsheba, with a sad, bursting heart, looked at these primest specimens of her prime flock as they rolled there,— Swoln with wind and the rank mist they drew.
But a manly resolve to recognize boldly that he had no longer a lover’s interest in her, helped him occasionally to conceal a feeling.
That was my depth!… However, let her marry an she will.
I believe Farmer Boldwood kissed her behind the spear-bed at the sheep-washing t’other day—that I do.” “What a lie!” said Gabriel.
He did not covet the post relatively to the farm: in relation to herself, as beloved by him and unmarried to another, he had coveted it.
Gabriel at this time of his life had outgrown the instinctive dislike which every Christian boy has for reading the Bible, perusing it now quite frequently, and he inwardly said, “‘I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets!’” This was mere exclamation—the froth of the storm.
He adored Bathsheba just the same.
Supper being ended, Coggan began on his own private account, without reference to listeners:— “I’ve lost my love, and I care not, I’ve lost my love, and I care not; I shall soon have another That’s better than t’other; I’ve lost my love, and I care not.” This melody, when concluded, was received with a silently appreciative gaze at the table, implying that the performance, like a work by those established authors who are independent of notices in the papers, was a well-known delight which required no applause.
“‘They do sing’ was a very taking paragraph.” “Ay; and there was a pretty place at ‘seeds of love,’ and ’twas well let out.
Though ‘love’ is a nasty high corner when a man’s voice is getting crazed.
This unwonted abstraction by love of all dignity from a man of whom it had ever seemed the chief component, was, in its distressing incongruity, a pain to her which quenched much of the pleasure she derived from the proof that she was idolized.
“I will try to love you,” she was saying, in a trembling voice quite unlike her usual self-confidence.
“And if I can believe in any way that I shall make you a good wife I shall indeed be willing to marry you.
Bathsheba knew more of him now; he had entirely bared his heart before her, even until he had almost worn in her eyes the sorry look of a grand bird without the feathers that make it grand.
Women are never tired of bewailing man’s fickleness in love, but they only seem to snub his constancy.
He could in this way be one thing and seem another: for instance, he could speak of love and think of dinner; call on the husband to look at the wife; be eager to pay and intend to owe.
if I may ask without offence.” “Because I don’t much want to thank you for any” thing.” “I am afraid I have made a hole with my tongue that my heart will never mend.
That remark seems somewhat digressive.” “It means that I would rather have your room than your company.” “And I would rather have curses from you than kisses from any other woman; so I’ll stay here.” Bathsheba was absolutely speechless.
“Probably some one man on an average falls in love, with each ordinary woman.
She can marry him: he is content, and leads a useful life.
Such women as you a hundred men always covet—your eyes will bewitch scores on scores into an unavailing fancy for you—you can only marry one of that many.
Out of these say twenty will endeavour to drown the bitterness of despised love in drink: twenty more will mope away their lives without a wish or attempt to make a mark in the world, because they have no ambition apart from their attachment to you: twenty more—the susceptible person myself possibly among them—will be always draggling after you, getting where they may just see you, doing desperate things.
And not only those ninety-nine men, but the ninety-nine women they might have married are saddened with them.
“I do—when I have an opportunity, which latterly has not been often (my mother was a Parisienne)—and there’s a proverb they have, ‘Qui aime bien, châtie bien’—‘He chastens who loves well.’ Do you understand me?” “Ah!” she replied, and there was even a little tremulousness in the usually cool girl’s voice; “if you can only fight half as winningly as you can talk, you are able to make a pleasure of a bayonet wound!” And then poor Bathsheba instantly perceived her slip in making this admission: in hastily trying to retrieve it, she went from bad to worse.
I loved you then, at once—as I do now.” Bathsheba surveyed him curiously, from the feet upward, as high as she liked to venture her glance, which was not quite so high as his eyes.
A more plebeian one will answer my purpose just as well, and the pleasure of knowing whose heart my old one beats against—well, I won’t speak of that.
You should not be so reckless, indeed, Sergeant Troy!” “I loved my father: good; but better, I love you more.
Her heart erratically flitting hither and thither from perplexed excitement, hot, and almost tearful, she retreated homeward, murmuring, “Oh, what have I done!
He had kissed her.
Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self-reliant women love when they abandon their self-reliance.
Her love was entire as a child’s, and though warm as summer it was fresh as spring.
The difference between love and respect was markedly shown in her conduct.
Bathsheba had spoken of her interest in Boldwood with the greatest freedom to Liddy, but she had only communed with her own heart concerning Troy.
All this infatuation Gabriel saw, and was troubled thereby from the time of his daily journey a-field to the time of his return, and on to the small hours of many a night.
That he was not beloved had hitherto been his great sorrow; that Bathsheba was getting into the toils was now a sorrow greater than the first, and one which nearly obscured it.
That is a noble though perhaps an unpromising love which not even the fear of breeding aversion in the bosom of the one beloved can deter from combating his or her errors.
No marriage is likely to take place between us.” Gabriel now put forth his unobscured opinion, for the moment had come.
“Well, Miss Everdene,” he said, “putting aside what people say, I never in my life saw any courting if his is not a courting of you.” Bathsheba would probably have terminated the conversation there and then by flatly forbidding the subject, had not her conscious weakness of position allured her to palter and argue in endeavours to better it.
I respect him, and he has urged me to marry him.
As soon as he returns I shall do so; and the answer will be that I cannot think of marrying him.” “People are full of mistakes, seemingly.” “They are.” “The other day they said you were trifling with him, and you almost proved that you were not; lately they have said that you are not, and you straightway begin to show——” “That I am, I suppose you mean.” “Well, I hope they speak the truth.” “They do, but wrongly applied.
He brimmed with deep feeling as he replied in a steady voice, the steadiness of which was spoilt by the palpableness of his great effort to keep it so:— “You know, mistress, that I love you, and shall love you always.
But Bathsheba, dear mistress, this I beg you to consider—that, both to keep yourself well honoured among the workfolk, and in common generosity to an honourable man who loves you as well as I, you should be more discreet in your bearing towards this soldier.” “Don’t, don’t, don’t!” she exclaimed, in a choking voice.
I am six years older than you, and Mr. Boldwood is ten years older than I, and consider—I do beg of you to consider before it is too late—how safe you would be in his hands!” Oak’s allusion to his own love for her lessened, to some extent, her anger at his interference; but she could not really forgive him for letting his wish to marry her be eclipsed by his wish to do her good, any more than for his slighting treatment of Troy.
He had also kissed her a second time.
In three minutes, without pause or modification, she had written a letter to Boldwood, at his address beyond Casterbridge, saying mildly but firmly that she had well considered the whole subject he had brought before her and kindly given her time to decide upon; that her final decision was that she could not marry him.
“If he marry her, she’ll gie up farming.” “’Twill be a gallant life, but may bring some trouble between the mirth—so say I.” “Well, I wish I had half such a husband.” Bathsheba had too much sense to mind seriously what her servitors said about her; but too much womanly redundance of speech to leave alone what was said till it died the natural death of unminded things.
“You admired him from your heart only this morning in the very world, you did.
Mind this, if any of you say a word against him you’ll be dismissed instantly.” She flung down the letter and surged back into the parlour, with a big heart and tearful eyes, Liddy following her.
I’ll make answer hencefor’ard, ‘Of course a lady like Miss Everdene can’t love him;’ I’ll say it out in plain black and white.” Bathsheba burst out: “O Liddy, are you such a simpleton?
“Oh, I love him to very distraction and misery and agony!
And don’t you know that a woman who loves at all thinks nothing of perjury when it is balanced against her love?
How can you have the cruel heart to repeat what they say?
My poor life and heart, how weak I am!” she moaned, in a relaxed, desultory way, heedless of Liddy’s presence.
“Mind this, Lydia Smallbury, if you repeat anywhere a single word of what I have said to you inside this closed door, I’ll never trust you, or love you, or have you with me a moment longer—not a moment.” “I don’t want to repeat anything,” said Liddy, with womanly dignity of a diminutive order; “but I don’t wish to stay with you.
Dear, dear—I don’t know what I am doing since this miserable ache o’ my heart has weighted and worn upon me so.
I am friendless enough, God knows.” “I won’t notice anything, nor will I leave you!” sobbed Liddy, impulsively putting up her lips to Bathsheba’s, and kissing her.
Then Bathsheba kissed Liddy, and all was smooth again.
Bathsheba’s companion, as a gage of their reconciliation, had been granted a week’s holiday to visit her sister, who was married to a thriving hurdler and cattle-crib-maker living in a delightful labyrinth of hazel copse not far from Yalbury.
That Bathsheba was a firm and positive girl, far less inconsequent than her fellows, had been the very lung of his hope; for he had held that these qualities would lead her to adhere to a straight course for consistency’s sake, and accept him, though her fancy might not flood him with the iridescent hues of uncritical love.
I am not to marry you, and that’s enough.
I never had you.” In her noon-clear sense that she had never loved him she forgot for a moment her thoughtless angle on that day in February.
Oh, could I but have foreseen the torture that trifling trick was going to lead me into, how I should have cursed you; but only having been able to see it since, I cannot do that, for I love you too well!
Bathsheba, you are the first woman of any shade or nature that I have ever looked at to love, and it is the having been so near claiming you for my own that makes this denial so hard to bear.
But I don’t speak now to move your heart, and make you grieve because of my pain; it is no use, that.
Your dear love, Bathsheba, is such a vast thing beside your pity, that the loss of your pity as well as your love is no great addition to my sorrow, nor does the gain of your pity make it sensibly less.
Where are your pleasant words all gone—your earnest hope to be able to love me?
Would you have had me a woman of clay when you paid me that furthest, highest compliment a man can pay a woman—telling her he loves her?
You overrate my capacity for love.
It isn’t because you have no feeling in you that you don’t love me.
You naturally would have me think so—you would hide from me that you have a burning heart like mine.
You have love enough, but it is turned into a new channel.
I know where.” The swift music of her heart became hubbub now, and she throbbed to extremity.
Go and marry your man—go on!” “Oh sir—Mr.
I loved a woman once.
He has kissed you—claimed you as his.
Do you hear—he has kissed you.
Let me go on!” “Deny that he has kissed you.” “I shall not.” “Ha—then he has!” came hoarsely from the farmer.
Oh, be kind to him, sir, for I love him true!” Boldwood’s ideas had reached that point of fusion at which outline and consistency entirely disappear.
He stole your dear heart away with his unfathomable lies!… It is a fortunate thing for him that he’s gone back to his regiment—that he’s in Melchester, and not here!
The force of the farmer’s threats lay in their relation to a circumstance known at present only to herself: her lover was coming back to Weatherby the very next day.

It was a picture full of misery, but for a while she contemplated it firmly, allowing herself, nevertheless, as girls will, to dwell upon the happy life she would have enjoyed had Troy been Boldwood, and the path of love the path of duty—inflicting upon herself gratuitous tortures by imagining him the lover of another woman after forgetting her; for she had penetrated Troy’s nature so far as to estimate his tendencies pretty accurately, but unfortunately loved him no less in thinking that he might soon cease to love her—indeed, considerably more.
Was Bathsheba altogether blind to the obvious fact that the support of a lover’s arms is not of a kind best calculated to assist a resolve to renounce him?
“’Twas a bad leg allowed me to read the _Pilgrim’s Progress_, and Mark Clark learnt All-Fours in a whitlow.” “Ay, and my father put his arm out of joint to have time to go courting,” said Jan Coggan, in an eclipsing tone, wiping his face with his shirt-sleeve and thrusting back his hat upon the nape of his neck.
And bymeby they got closer and closer, and then they went arm-in-crook, like courting complete—hok-hok!
like courting complete—hok!—courting complete—” Losing the thread of his narrative at this point simultaneously with his loss of breath, their informant looked up and down the field apparently for some clue to it.
“Ah,” said Matthew Moon, “she’ll wish her cake dough if so be she’s over intimate with that man.” “She’s not over intimate with him,” said Gabriel, indignantly.
What difference does it make whose sweetheart she is, since she can’t be yours?” “That’s the very thing I say to myself,” said Gabriel.
You ought to marry her.” “I suppose I ought.
“I was engaged to be married to Miss Everdene,” said Boldwood, “but you came and——” “Not engaged,” said Troy.
If you had not seen her you might have been married to Fanny.
Well, there’s too much difference between Miss Everdene’s station and your own for this flirtation with her ever to benefit you by ending in marriage.
We discern a grand force in the lover which he lacks whilst a free man; but there is a breadth of vision in the free man which in the lover we vainly seek.
Where there is much bias there must be some narrowness, and love, though added emotion, is subtracted capacity.
“I like Fanny best,” said Troy; “and if, as you say, Miss Everdene is out of my reach, why I have all to gain by accepting your money, and marrying Fan.
“Oh Troy, if you like her best, why then did you step in here and injure my happiness?” “I love Fanny best now,” said Troy.
“Shall I tell her I have come to give her up and cannot marry her?” said the soldier, mockingly.
I can’t, however, marry them both.
Boldwood loosened his hand, saying, “By Heaven, I’ve a mind to kill you!” “And ruin her.” “Save her.” “Oh, how can she be saved now, unless I marry her?” Boldwood groaned.
She must love you indeed to sell soul and body to you so utterly as she has done.
Wretched woman—deluded woman—you are, Bathsheba!” “But about Fanny?” “Bathsheba is a woman well to do,” continued Boldwood, in nervous anxiety, “and, Troy, she will make a good wife; and, indeed, she is worth your hastening on your marriage with her!” “But she has a will—not to say a temper, and I shall be a mere slave to her.
Troy went on,— “I shall soon purchase my discharge, and then——” “But I wish you to hasten on this marriage.
You love each other, and you must let me help you to do it.” “How?” “Why, by settling the five hundred on Bathsheba instead of Fanny, to enable you to marry at once.
I’ll pay it down to you on the wedding-day.” Troy paused in secret amazement at Boldwood’s wild and purblind infatuation.
Troy continued,— “Fifty pounds to marry Fanny, Good.
Twenty-one pounds not to marry Fanny, but Bathsheba.
Bad as I am, I am not such a villain as to make the marriage or misery of any woman a matter of huckster and sale.
You say you love Bathsheba; yet on the merest apparent evidence you instantly believe in her dishonour.
A fig for such love!
“She has married him!” he said.
That they were married he had instantly decided.
“I’d say good morning—you needn’t spend a hapeth of meaning upon it, and yet keep the man civil.” Gabriel soon decided too that, since the deed was done, to put the best face upon the matter would be the greatest kindness to her he loved.
“Why—they _may_ not be married!” suggested Coggan.
“For if he’s married to her, mark my words, he’ll buy his discharge and be our master here.
The clash of discord between mood and matter here was forced painfully home to the heart; and, as in laughter there are more dreadful phases than in tears, so was there in the steadiness of this agonized man an expression deeper than a cry.
WEALTH IN JEOPARDY—THE REVEL One night, at the end of August, when Bathsheba’s experiences as a married woman were still new, and when the weather was yet dry and sultry, a man stood motionless in the stackyard of Weatherbury Upper Farm, looking at the moon and sky.
“Then,” said the fiddler, “I’ll venture to name that the right and proper thing is ‘The Soldier’s Joy’—there being a gallant soldier married into the farm—hey, my sonnies, and gentlemen all?” “It shall be ‘The Soldier’s Joy,’ exclaimed a chorus.
Troy says it will not rain,” returned the messenger, “and he cannot stop to talk to you about such fidgets.” In juxtaposition with Troy, Oak had a melancholy tendency to look like a candle beside gas, and ill at ease, he went out again, thinking he would go home; for, under the circumstances, he had no heart for the scene in the barn.
It is possible that there was this golden legend under the utilitarian one: “I will help, to my last effort, the woman I have loved so dearly.” He went back to the barn to endeavour to obtain assistance for covering the ricks that very night.
Gabriel was almost blinded, and he could feel Bathsheba’s warm arm tremble in his hand—a sensation novel and thrilling enough; but love, life, everything human, seemed small and trifling in such close juxtaposition with an infuriated universe.
“I suppose you thought that when I galloped away to Bath that night it was on purpose to be married?” “I did at last—not at first,” he answered, somewhat surprised at the abruptness with which this new subject was broached.
It was owing to circumstances which occurred after I got there that—that we were married.
And perhaps it’s no harm, for you are certainly under no delusion that I ever loved you, or that I can have any object in speaking, more than that object I have mentioned.
“And then, between jealousy and distraction, I married him!” she whispered, with desperate impetuosity.
He worked in a reverie now, musing upon her story, and upon the contradictoriness of that feminine heart which had caused her to speak more warmly to him to-night than she ever had done whilst unmarried and free to speak as warmly as she chose.
Oak suddenly remembered that eight months before this time he had been fighting against fire in the same spot as desperately as he was fighting against water now—and for a futile love of the same woman.
Oak was just thinking that whatever he himself might have suffered from Bathsheba’s marriage, here was a man who had suffered more, when Boldwood spoke in a changed voice—that of one who yearned to make a confidence and relieve his heart by an outpouring.
I was going to get a little settled in life; but in some way my plan has come to nothing.” “I thought my mistress would have married you,” said Gabriel, not knowing enough of the full depths of Boldwood’s love to keep silence on the farmer’s account, and determined not to evade discipline by doing so on his own.
“Yes, if it hadn’t been for that wretched rain I should have cleared two hundred as easy as looking, my love,” he was saying.
Aye, Pimpernel regularly stuck fast when about sixty yards off, and when I saw Policy stepping on, it did knock my heart against the lining of my ribs, I assure you, my love!” “And you mean, Frank,” said Bathsheba, sadly—her voice was painfully lowered from the fulness and vivacity of the previous summer—“that you have lost more than a hundred pounds in a month by this dreadful horse-racing?
Whilst she sorrowed in her heart she cheered with her voice, and what was stranger than that the strong should need encouragement from the weak was that cheerfulness should be so well stimulated by such utter dejection.
He did not now love her enough to allow himself to be carried too far by her ways.
“What do you regret?” “That my romance has come to an end.” “All romances end at marriage.” “I wish you wouldn’t talk like that.
It is the hair of a young woman I was going to marry before I knew you.” “You ought to tell me her name, then.” “I cannot do that.” “Is she married yet?” “No.” “Is she alive?” “Yes.” “Is she pretty?” “Yes.” “It is wonderful how she can be, poor thing, under such an awful affliction!” “Affliction—what affliction?” he inquired, quickly.
“If I cared for your love as much as I used to I could say people had turned to look at mine.” “Bathsheba, don’t be so fitful and jealous.
You knew what married life would be like, and shouldn’t have entered it if you feared these contingencies.” Troy had by this time driven her to bitterness: her heart was big in her throat, and the ducts to her eyes were painfully full.
Ashamed as she was to show emotion, at last she burst out:— “This is all I get for loving you so well!
when I married you your life was dearer to me than my own.
And now you sneer at my foolishness in marrying you.
Whatever opinion you may have of my wisdom, you should not tell me of it so mercilessly, now that I am in your power.” “I can’t help how things fall out,” said Troy; “upon my heart, women will be the death of me!” “Well you shouldn’t keep people’s hair.
If you repent of marrying, so do I.” Trembling now, she put her hand upon his arm, saying, in mingled tones of wretchedness and coaxing, “I only repent it if you don’t love me better than any woman in the world.
You don’t repent because you already love somebody better than you love me, do you?” “I don’t know.
Her pride was indeed brought low by despairing discoveries of her spoliation by marriage with a less pure nature than her own.
Until she had met Troy, Bathsheba had been proud of her position as a woman; it had been a glory to her to know that her lips had been touched by no man’s on earth—that her waist had never been encircled by a lover’s arm.
She had never taken kindly to the idea of marriage in the abstract as did the majority of women she saw about her.
In the turmoil of her anxiety for her lover she had agreed to marry him; but the perception that had accompanied her happiest hours on this account was rather that of self-sacrifice than of promotion and honour.
Although she scarcely knew the divinity’s name, Diana was the goddess whom Bathsheba instinctively adored.
That she had never, by look, word, or sign, encouraged a man to approach her—that she had felt herself sufficient to herself, and had in the independence of her girlish heart fancied there was a certain degradation in renouncing the simplicity of a maiden existence to become the humbler half of an indifferent matrimonial whole—were facts now bitterly remembered.
Of course, she sometimes thought of him in the light of an old lover, and had momentary imaginings of what life with him as a husband would have been like; also of life with Boldwood under the same conditions.
“Whose sweetheart did you say, Joseph?” “I don’t know, ma’am.” “Are you quite sure?” “Yes, ma’am, quite sure.” “Sure of what?” “I’m sure that all I know is that she arrived in the morning and died in the evening without further parley.
It was a relief to Joseph’s heart when the friendly sign-board came in view, and, stopping his horse immediately beneath it, he proceeded to fulfil an intention made a long time before.
And while peace and plen-ty I find at my board, With a heart free from sick-ness and sor-row, With my friends will I share what to-day may af-ford, And let them spread the ta-ble to-mor-row.
But, thanks to Boldwood’s reticence and Oak’s generosity, the lover she had followed had never been individualized as Troy.
Bathsheba was lonely and miserable now; not lonelier actually than she had been before her marriage; but her loneliness then was to that of the present time as the solitude of a mountain is to the solitude of a cave.
Perhaps it would be more accurately described as a determined rebellion against her prejudices, a revulsion from a lower instinct of uncharitableness, which would have withheld all sympathy from the dead woman, because in life she had preceded Bathsheba in the attentions of a man whom Bathsheba had by no means ceased from loving, though her love was sick to death just now with the gravity of a further misgiving.
Bathsheba’s face, as she continued looking into the fire that evening, might have excited solicitousness on her account even among those who loved her least.
With a swollen heart she went again up the lane, and entered her own door.
He sank upon his knees with an indefinable union of remorse and reverence upon his face, and, bending over Fanny Robin, gently kissed her, as one would kiss an infant asleep to avoid awakening it.
She flung her arms round Troy’s neck, exclaiming wildly from the deepest deep of her heart,— “Don’t—don’t kiss them!
I love you better than she did: kiss me too, Frank—kiss me!
_You will, Frank, kiss me too!_” There was something so abnormal and startling in the childlike pain and simplicity of this appeal from a woman of Bathsheba’s calibre and independence, that Troy, loosening her tightly clasped arms from his neck, looked at her in bewilderment.
It was such and unexpected revelation of all women being alike at heart, even those so different in their accessories as Fanny and this one beside him, that Troy could hardly seem to believe her to be his proud wife Bathsheba.
“I will not kiss you,” he said, pushing her away.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>If Satan had not tempted me with that face of yours, and those cursed coquetries, I should have married her.
“A ceremony before a priest doesn’t make a marriage.
Bathsheba’s heart bounded with gratitude in the thought that she was not altogether deserted, and she jumped up.
“Liddy,” she said, with a lighter heart, for youth and hope had begun to re-assert themselves; “you are to be my confidante for the present—somebody must be—and I choose you.
I haven’t heart to read anything new.” “Some of your uncle’s old ones, ma’am?” “Yes.
The crocuses and hyacinths were to grow in rows; some of the summer flowers he placed over her head and feet, the lilies and forget-me-nots over her heart.
Troy, in his prostration at this time, had no perception that in the futility of these romantic doings, dictated by a remorseful reaction from previous indifference, there was any element of absurdity.
The flowers so carefully planted by Fanny’s repentant lover began to move and writhe in their bed.
Finally, with the superfluous magnanimity of a woman whose converse and narrower instincts have brought down bitterness upon her instead of love, she wiped the mud spots from the tomb as if she rather liked its words than otherwise, and went home again.
She had latterly been in great doubt as to what the legal effects of her marriage would be upon her position; but no notice had been taken as yet of her change of name, and only one point was clear—that in the event of her own or her husband’s inability to meet the agent at the forthcoming January rent-day, very little consideration would be shown, and, for that matter, very little would be deserved.
The first Saturday after Troy’s departure she went to Casterbridge alone, a journey she had not before taken since her marriage.
What he would try to recognize was that the severe schooling she had been subjected to had made Bathsheba much more considerate than she had formerly been of the feelings of others, and he trusted that, should she be willing at any time in the future to marry any man at all, that man would be himself.
There was a substratum of good feeling in her: her self reproach for the injury she had thoughtlessly done him might be depended upon now to a much greater extent than before her infatuation and disappointment.
She simpered, and wondered in her heart why he should speak so frankly to her.
And if she were to marry again I expect I should bide with her.” “She promises that you shall—quite natural,” said the strategic lover, throbbing throughout him at the presumption which Liddy’s words appeared to warrant—that his darling had thought of re-marriage.
When she alludes to the possibility of marrying again, you conclude——” “She never do allude to it, sir,” said Liddy, thinking how very stupid Mr. Boldwood was getting.
Well, perhaps, as she is absolute mistress again now, it is wise of her to resolve never to give up her freedom.” “My mistress did certainly once say, though not seriously, that she supposed she might marry again at the end of seven years from last year, if she wished.” “Ah, six years from the present time.
She might marry at once in every reasonable person’s opinion, whatever the lawyers may say to the contrary.” “Have you been to ask them?” said Liddy, innocently.
In little more than six years from this time Bathsheba might certainly marry him.
There was something definite in that hope, for admitting that there might have been no deep thought in her words to Liddy about marriage, they showed at least her creed on the matter.
Boldwood felt his love to be so deep and strong and eternal, that it was possible she had never yet known its full volume, and this patience in delay would afford him an opportunity of giving sweet proof on the point.
He would annihilate the six years of his life as if they were minutes—so little did he value his time on earth beside her love.
He would let her see, all those six years of intangible ethereal courtship, how little care he had for anything but as it bore upon the consummation.
These were so convinced by such genuine appeals to heart and understanding both that they soon began to crowd in abundantly, among the foremost being visible Jan Coggan and Joseph Poorgrass, who were holiday keeping here to-day.
A warmth overspread his face: surely she was not so unprincipled as to flirt in a fair!
Then he thought how the proud girl who had always looked down upon him even whilst it was to love him, would hate him on discovering him to be a strolling player.
Immediately after the incident in the tent, she had risen to go—now absolutely alarmed and really grateful for her old lover’s protection—though regretting Gabriel’s absence, whose company she would have much preferred, as being more proper as well as more pleasant, since he was her own managing-man and servant.
Hence her pity for the man who so persistently loved on to his own injury and permanent gloom had betrayed Bathsheba into an injudicious considerateness of manner, which appeared almost like tenderness, and gave new vigour to the exquisite dream of a Jacob’s seven years’ service in poor Boldwood’s mind.
Troy, you will marry again some day?” This point-blank query unmistakably confused her, it was not till a minute or more had elapsed that she said, “I have not seriously thought of any such subject.” “I quite understand that.
But though I am fully persuaded that I shall see him no more, I am far from thinking of marriage with another.
Bathsheba, suppose you had real complete proof that you are what, in fact, you are—a widow—would you repair the old wrong to me by marrying me?” “I cannot say.
I shouldn’t yet, at any rate.” “But you might at some future time of your life?” “Oh yes, I might at some time.” “Well, then, do you know that without further proof of any kind you may marry again in about six years from the present—subject to nobody’s objection or blame?” “Oh yes,” she said, quickly.
“If I wait that time, will you marry me?
O Bathsheba, promise—it is only a little promise—that if you marry again, you will marry me!” His tone was so excited that she almost feared him at this moment, even whilst she sympathized.
She said, with some distress in her voice, for she remembered vividly his outburst on the Yalbury Road, and shrank from a repetition of his anger:— “I will never marry another man whilst you wish me to be your wife, whatever comes—but to say more—you have taken me so by surprise—” “But let it stand in these simple words—that in six years’ time you will be my wife?
I don’t love you, and I much fear that I never shall love you as much as a woman ought to love a husband.
If you, sir, know that, and I can yet give you happiness by a mere promise without feeling, and just in friendliness, to marry at the end of six years, it is a great honour to me.
And if you value such an act of friendship from a woman who doesn’t esteem herself as she did, and has little love left, why I—I will—” “Promise!” “—Consider, if I cannot promise soon.” “But soon is perhaps never?” “Oh no, it is not!
“In fact the very thing that makes it doubtful if you ought to marry en under any condition, that is, your not caring about him—for I may suppose——” “Yes, you may suppose that love is wanting,” she said shortly.
“Love is an utterly bygone, sorry, worn-out, miserable thing with me—for him or any one else.” “Well, your want of love seems to me the one thing that takes away harm from such an agreement with him.
The real sin, ma’am, in my mind, lies in thinking of ever wedding with a man you don’t love honest and true.” “That I’m willing to pay the penalty of,” said Bathsheba, firmly.
If I had never played a trick upon him, he would never have wanted to marry me.
I’ve been a rake, and the single point I ask you is, considering that my own scruples, and the fact that in the eye of the law my husband is only missing, will keep any man from marrying me until seven years have passed—am I free to entertain such an idea, even though ’tis a sort of penance—for it will be that.
I _hate_ the act of marriage under such circumstances, and the class of women I should seem to belong to by doing it!” “It seems to me that all depends upon whe’r you think, as everybody else does, that your husband is dead.” “Yes—I’ve long ceased to doubt that.
I well know what would have brought him back long before this time if he had lived.” “Well, then, in religious sense you must be as free to think o’ marrying again as any other widow of one year’s standing.
Yet in the centremost parts of her complicated heart there existed at this minute a little pang of disappointment, for a reason she would not allow herself to recognize.
Oak had not once wished her free that he might marry her himself—had not once said, “I could wait for you as well as he.” That was the insect sting.
Yet he might have just hinted about that old love of his, and asked, in a playful off hand way, if he might speak of it.
However, does a woman keep a promise, not to marry, but to enter on an engagement to marry at some time?
She has a notion that a woman should not marry within seven years of her husband’s death—that her own self shouldn’t, I mean—because his body was not found.
If she promises me, she’ll marry me.
But knowing what rum things we women are, I just said—however, I won’t speak of it again.” “No marrying for me yet for many a year; if ever, ’twill be for reasons very, very different from those you think, or others will believe.
Then, if I marry her—and I hope—I feel I shall, why——” “Pray don’t speak of it, sir,” said Oak, hastily.
And now I’ve no heart to go in.
Somehow the fun seems to hang fire, though everything’s there that a heart can desire, and I couldn’t for my soul interfere and throw damp upon it—if ’twas to save my life, I couldn’t!” “I suppose we had better all go in together,” said Samway, gloomily.
“A promise to marry me at the end of five years and three-quarters.
I give it as the rendering of a debt.” “You’ll marry me between five and six years hence.” “Don’t press me too hard.
I’ll marry nobody else.” “But surely you will name the time, or there’s nothing in the promise at all.” “Oh I don’t know, pray let me go!” she said, her bosom beginning to rise.
There is a shadow of a doubt of his death, and then it is dreadful; let me ask a solicitor, Mr. Boldwood, if I ought or no!” “Say the words, dear one, and the subject shall be dismissed; a blissful loving intimacy of six years, and then marriage—O Bathsheba, say them!” he begged in a husky voice, unable to sustain the forms of mere friendship any longer.
“Promise yourself to me; I deserve it, indeed I do, for I have loved you more than anybody in the world.
I’ll marry you in six years from this day, if we both live,” she said solemnly.
“I cannot wear it,” she said, weeping as if her heart would break.
Now loosen my hand; I will, indeed I will wear it to-night.” “And it shall be the beginning of a pleasant secret courtship of six years, with a wedding at the end?” “It must be, I suppose, since you will have it so!” she said, fairly beaten into non-resistance.
Anybody married or engaged, born or dead?” inquired the farmer, gaily.
“There is another way for me to die.” Then he broke from Samway, crossed the room to Bathsheba, and kissed her hand.
She was indispensable to high generation, feared at tea parties, hated in shops, and loved at crises.
She must have the nerve of a stoic!” “The heart of a wife merely,” floated in a whisper about the ears of the three, and turning they saw Bathsheba in the midst of them.
That he had been from the time of Greenhill Fair until the fatal Christmas Eve in excited and unusual moods was known to those who had been intimate with him; but nobody imagined that there had shown unequivocal symptoms of the mental derangement which Bathsheba and Troy, alone of all others and at different times, had momentarily suspected.
These somewhat pathetic evidences of a mind crazed with care and love were the subject of discourse in Warren’s malthouse when Oak entered from Casterbridge with tidings of the sentence.
Gabriel’s anxiety was great that Boldwood might be saved even though in his conscience he felt that he ought to die; for there had been qualities in the farmer which Oak loved.
’Tis confinement during her Majesty’s pleasure.” “Hurrah!” said Coggan, with a swelling heart.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“Are you going in?” said Bathsheba; and there came from within the church as from a prompter— “I loved the garish day; in spite of fears Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.” “I was,” said Gabriel.
I’ll leave you, then.” “Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile,” sang the children.
On examining her heart it appeared beyond measure strange that the subject of which the season might have been supposed suggestive—the event in the hall at Boldwood’s—was not agitating her at all; but instead, an agonizing conviction that everybody abjured her—for what she could not tell—and that Oak was the ringleader of the recusants.
She was aggrieved and wounded that the possession of hopeless love from Gabriel, which she had grown to regard as her inalienable right for life, should have been withdrawn just at his own pleasure in this way.
Surely, surely you be the last person in the world I think of marrying.
“Bathsheba,” he said, tenderly and in surprise, and coming closer: “if I only knew one thing—whether you would allow me to love you and win you, and marry you after all—if I only knew that!” “But you never will know,” she murmured.
It was very cruel of you, considering I was the first sweetheart that you ever had, and you were the first I ever had; and I shall not forget it!” “Now, Bathsheba, was ever anybody so provoking?” he said, laughing.
Why Gabriel,” she said, with a slight laugh, as they went to the door, “it seems exactly as if I had come courting you—how dreadful!” “And quite right too,” said Oak.
Theirs was that substantial affection which arises (if any arises at all) when the two who are thrown together begin first by knowing the rougher sides of each other’s character, and not the best till further on, the romance growing up in the interstices of a mass of hard prosaic reality.
This good-fellowship—_camaraderie_—usually occurring through similarity of pursuits, is unfortunately seldom superadded to love between the sexes, because men and women associate, not in their labours, but in their pleasures merely.
Where, however, happy circumstance permits its development, the compounded feeling proves itself to be the only love which is strong as death—that love which many waters cannot quench, nor the floods drown, beside which the passion usually called by the name is evanescent as steam.
Well, then, mistress and I mean to get married to-morrow morning.” “Heaven’s high tower!
There, that’s what ’tis, and now I’ve told ye, Mother Tall, in a way I shouldn’t ha’ done if I hadn’t loved ye so hopeless well.” Coggan retired before she could ask any further; and next they called at the vicar’s in a way which excited no curiosity at all.
It makes my heart go quite bumpity-bump!” “It makes mine rather furious, too,” said Bathsheba.
I had a thought that we might very likely get a salute of some sort from our old friends, and I was saying so to my wife but now.” “Faith,” said Coggan, in a critical tone, turning to his companions, “the man hev learnt to say ‘my wife’ in a wonderful naterel way, considering how very youthful he is in wedlock as yet—hey, neighbours all?” “I never heerd a skilful old married feller of twenty years’ standing pipe ‘my wife’ in a more used note than ’a did,” said Jacob Smallbury.

What a strange, unaccountable character!—for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old, she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom stubborn, scarcely ever quarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones, with few interruptions of tyranny; she was moreover noisy and wild, hated confinement and cleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house.
Her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery, and she grew clean as she grew smart; she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement.
From Pope, she learnt to censure those who “bear about the mockery of woe.” From Gray, that “Many a flower is born to blush unseen, “And waste its fragrance on the desert air.” From Thomson, that— “It is a delightful task “To teach the young idea how to shoot.” And from Shakespeare she gained a great store of information—amongst the rest, that— “Trifles light as air, “Are, to the jealous, confirmation strong, “As proofs of Holy Writ.” That “The poor beetle, which we tread upon, “In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great “As when a giant dies.” And that a young woman in love always looks— “like Patience on a monument “Smiling at Grief.” So far her improvement was sufficient—and in many other points she came on exceedingly well; for though she could not write sonnets, she brought herself to read them; and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte, of her own composition, she could listen to other people’s performance with very little fatigue.
Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil—she had no notion of drawing—not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover’s profile, that she might be detected in the design.
At present she did not know her own poverty, for she had no lover to portray.
CHAPTER 2 In addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland’s personal and mental endowments, when about to be launched into all the difficulties and dangers of a six weeks’ residence in Bath, it may be stated, for the reader’s more certain information, lest the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is meant to be, that her heart was affectionate; her disposition cheerful and open, without conceit or affectation of any kind—her manners just removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl; her person pleasing, and, when in good looks, pretty—and her mind about as ignorant and uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is.
A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness, and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together; and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet.
Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm-house, must, at such a moment, relieve the fulness of her heart.
), must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante of her sister.
Mrs. Allen was one of that numerous class of females, whose society can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough to marry them.
I wish I had a large acquaintance here with all my heart, and then I should get you a partner.
Whether she thought of him so much, while she drank her warm wine and water, and prepared herself for bed, as to dream of him when there, cannot be ascertained; but I hope it was no more than in a slight slumber, or a morning doze at most; for if it be true, as a celebrated writer has maintained, that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman’s love is declared,[1] it must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her.
How proper Mr. Tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr. Allen’s head, but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied; for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was, and had been assured of Mr. Tilney’s being a clergyman, and of a very respectable family in Gloucestershire.
“What a delightful place Bath is,” said Mrs. Allen as they sat down near the great clock, after parading the room till they were tired; “and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here.” This sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had no particular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now; but we are told to “despair of nothing we would attain,” as “unwearied diligence our point would gain”; and the unwearied diligence with which she had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have its just reward, for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of about her own age, who was sitting by her, and had been looking at her attentively for several minutes, addressed her with great complaisance in these words: “I think, madam, I cannot be mistaken; it is a long time since I had the pleasure of seeing you, but is not your name Allen?” This question answered, as it readily was, the stranger pronounced hers to be Thorpe; and Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages, and that many years ago.
Mrs. Thorpe, however, had one great advantage as a talker, over Mrs. Allen, in a family of children; and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons, and the beauty of her daughters, when she related their different situations and views—that John was at Oxford, Edward at Merchant Taylors’, and William at sea—and all of them more beloved and respected in their different station than any other three beings ever were, Mrs. Allen had no similar information to give, no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend, and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions, consoling herself, however, with the discovery, which her keen eyes soon made, that the lace on Mrs. Thorpe’s pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own.
Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.
Miss Thorpe, however, being four years older than Miss Morland, and at least four years better informed, had a very decided advantage in discussing such points; she could compare the balls of Bath with those of Tunbridge, its fashions with the fashions of London; could rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful attire; could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other; and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd.
These powers received due admiration from Catherine, to whom they were entirely new; and the respect which they naturally inspired might have been too great for familiarity, had not the easy gaiety of Miss Thorpe’s manners, and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her, softened down every feeling of awe, and left nothing but tender affection.
Their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump-room, but required, when they all quitted it together, that Miss Thorpe should accompany Miss Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen’s house; and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands, after learning, to their mutual relief, that they should see each other across the theatre at night, and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning.
Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion—but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love, or the duties of friendship, to know when delicate raillery was properly called for, or when a confidence should be forced.
I have no notion of loving people by halves; it is not my nature.
i must tell you, that just after we parted yesterday, I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly—I am sure he is in love with you.” Catherine coloured, and disclaimed again.
Where the heart is really attached, I know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else.
Everything is so insipid, so uninteresting, that does not relate to the beloved object!
Aye, I remember, so it was; I was thinking of that other stupid book, written by that woman they make such a fuss about, she who married the French emigrant.” “I suppose you mean Camilla?” “Yes, that’s the book; such unnatural stuff!
an old man playing at see-saw, I took up the first volume once and looked it over, but I soon found it would not do; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be before I saw it: as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant, I was sure I should never be able to get through it.” “I have never read it.” “You had no loss, I assure you; it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man’s playing at see-saw and learning Latin; upon my soul there is not.” This critique, the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor Catherine, brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe’s lodgings, and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son, as they met Mrs. Thorpe, who had descried them from above, in the passage.
Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you, so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near.” And this address seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother’s heart, for she received him with the most delighted and exulting affection.
Had she been older or vainer, such attacks might have done little; but, where youth and diffidence are united, it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world, and of being so very early engaged as a partner; and the consequence was that, when the two Morlands, after sitting an hour with the Thorpes, set off to walk together to Mr. Allen’s, and James, as the door was closed on them, said, “Well, Catherine, how do you like my friend Thorpe?” instead of answering, as she probably would have done, had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case, “I do not like him at all,” she directly replied, “I like him very much; he seems very agreeable.” “He is as good-natured a fellow as ever lived; a little of a rattle; but that will recommend him to your sex, I believe: and how do you like the rest of the family?” “Very, very much indeed: Isabella particularly.” “I am very glad to hear you say so; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to; she has so much good sense, and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable; I always wanted you to know her; and she seems very fond of you.
She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be; and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you, Catherine,” taking her hand with affection, “may be proud of.” “Indeed I am,” she replied; “I love her exceedingly, and am delighted to find that you like her too.
I need not ask you whether you are happy here, my dear Catherine; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe, it would be impossible for you to be otherwise; and the Allens, I am sure, are very kind to you?” “Yes, very kind; I never was so happy before; and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever; how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see _me_.” James accepted this tribute of gratitude, and qualified his conscience for accepting it too, by saying with perfect sincerity, “Indeed, Catherine, I love you dearly.” Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters, the situation of some, the growth of the rest, and other family matters now passed between them, and continued, with only one small digression on James’s part, in praise of Miss Thorpe, till they reached Pulteney Street, where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen, invited by the former to dine with them, and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet.
The Thorpes and James Morland were there only two minutes before them; and Isabella having gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the most smiling and affectionate haste, of admiring the set of her gown, and envying the curl of her hair, they followed their chaperons, arm in arm, into the ballroom, whispering to each other whenever a thought occurred, and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand or a smile of affection.
“I assure you,” said she, “I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world; for if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening.” Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude, and they continued as they were for three minutes longer, when Isabella, who had been talking to James on the other side of her, turned again to his sister and whispered, “My dear creature, I am afraid I must leave you, your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin; I know you will not mind my going away, and I dare say John will be back in a moment, and then you may easily find me out.” Catherine, though a little disappointed, had too much good nature to make any opposition, and the others rising up, Isabella had only time to press her friend’s hand and say, “Good-bye, my dear love,” before they hurried off.
To be disgraced in the eye of the world, to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity, her actions all innocence, and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement, is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine’s life, and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character.
He looked as handsome and as lively as ever, and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing-looking young woman, who leant on his arm, and whom Catherine immediately guessed to be his sister; thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever, by being married already.
But guided only by what was simple and probable, it had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married; he had not behaved, he had not talked, like the married men to whom she had been used; he had never mentioned a wife, and he had acknowledged a sister.
The first wish of her heart was to improve her acquaintance with Miss Tilney, and almost her first resolution, to seek her for that purpose, in the pump-room at noon.
Mrs. Tilney was a Miss Drummond, and she and Mrs. Hughes were schoolfellows; and Miss Drummond had a very large fortune; and, when she married, her father gave her twenty thousand pounds, and five hundred to buy wedding-clothes.
my beloved Catherine, have I got you at last?” was her address on Catherine’s entering the box and sitting by her.
I assure you, my brother is quite in love with you already; and as for Mr. Tilney—but _that_ is a settled thing—even _your_ modesty cannot doubt his attachment now; his coming back to Bath makes it too plain.
It would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how little the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire; how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin, and how unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged, the mull, or the jackonet.
With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she granted his request, and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went with him to the set, may be easily imagined.
I consider a country-dance as an emblem of marriage.
Fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both; and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves, have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours.” “But they are such very different things!” “—That you think they cannot be compared together.” “To be sure not.
People that marry can never part, but must go and keep house together.
In marriage, the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman, the woman to make the home agreeable to the man; he is to purvey, and she is to smile.
james’s coming (my eldest brother) is quite delightful—and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already.
But papas and mammas, and brothers, and intimate friends are a good deal gone by, to most of the frequenters of Bath—and the honest relish of balls and plays, and everyday sights, is past with them.” Here their conversation closed, the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention.
my beloved creature, what do you mean?” “I cannot go, because”—looking down as she spoke, fearful of Isabella’s smile—“I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk.
“You will quite break my heart.
To Milsom Street she was directed, and having made herself perfect in the number, hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit, explain her conduct, and be forgiven; tripping lightly through the church-yard, and resolutely turning away her eyes, that she might not be obliged to see her beloved Isabella and her dear family, who, she had reason to believe, were in a shop hard by.
Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her; instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation—instead of proudly resolving, in conscious innocence, to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it, to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation, and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight, or flirting with somebody else—she took to herself all the shame of misconduct, or at least of its appearance, and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause.
Catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry; and, while they waited in the lobby for a chair, he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue, by asking, in a consequential manner, whether she had seen him talking with General Tilney: “He is a fine old fellow, upon my soul!
In a private consultation between Isabella and James, the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going, and the latter no less anxiously placed his upon pleasing her, it was agreed that, provided the weather were fair, the party should take place on the following morning; and they were to set off very early, in order to be at home in good time.
There has been no prior engagement.” But Isabella became only more and more urgent, calling on her in the most affectionate manner, addressing her by the most endearing names.
She was sure her dearest, sweetest Catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly.
She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart, so sweet a temper, to be so easily persuaded by those she loved.
She reproached her with having more affection for Miss Tilney, though she had known her so little a while, than for her best and oldest friends, with being grown cold and indifferent, in short, towards herself.
“I cannot help being jealous, Catherine, when I see myself slighted for strangers, I, who love you so excessively!
If I am wrong, I am doing what I believe to be right.” “I suspect,” said Isabella, in a low voice, “there is no great struggle.” Catherine’s heart swelled; she drew away her arm, and Isabella made no opposition.
But Catherine did not know her own advantages—did not know that a good-looking girl, with an affectionate heart and a very ignorant mind, cannot fail of attracting a clever young man, unless circumstances are particularly untoward.
The morning had passed away so charmingly as to banish all her friendship and natural affection, for no thought of Isabella or James had crossed her during their walk.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“Nay, my beloved, sweetest friend,” continued the other, “compose yourself.
my dear Catherine, you alone, who know my heart, can judge of my present happiness.
Can you—can you really be in love with James?” This bold surmise, however, she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact.
The anxious affection, which she was accused of having continually watched in Isabella’s every look and action, had, in the course of their yesterday’s party, received the delightful confession of an equal love.
Her heart and faith were alike engaged to James.
The very first day that Morland came to us last Christmas—the very first moment I beheld him—my heart was irrecoverably gone.
I remember I wore my yellow gown, with my hair done up in braids; and when I came into the drawing-room, and John introduced him, I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before.” Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love; for, though exceedingly fond of her brother, and partial to all his endowments, she had never in her life thought him handsome.
“I remember too, Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening, and wore her puce-coloured sarsenet; and she looked so heavenly that I thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her; I could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it.
but my secret I was always sure would be safe with _you_.” Catherine felt that nothing could have been safer; but ashamed of an ignorance little expected, she dared no longer contest the point, nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as Isabella chose to consider her.
Your brother, who might marry anybody!” Here Catherine again discerned the force of love.
my sweet Catherine, in _your_ generous heart I know it would signify nothing; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many.
Their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself, who came to breathe his parting sigh before he set off for Wiltshire.
To Catherine’s simple feelings, this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant, nor consistently supported; and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out, had its inconsistency been less their friend; but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their “I know what”; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit, a display of family ingenuity, on one side in the mystery of an affected secret, on the other of undefined discovery, all equally acute.
Her heart was overflowing with tenderness.
It was “dear John” and “dear Catherine” at every word; “dear Anne and dear Maria” must immediately be made sharers in their felicity; and two “dears” at once before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned.
He made no answer; but after a minute’s silence burst out with, “A famous good thing this marrying scheme, upon my soul!
Give me but a little cheerful company, let me only have the company of the people I love, let me only be where I like and with whom I like, and the devil take the rest, say I.
And to marry for money I think the wickedest thing in existence.
Instead of finding herself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney, from the intercourse of the day, she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before; instead of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever, in the ease of a family party, he had never said so little, nor been so little agreeable; and, in spite of their father’s great civilities to her—in spite of his thanks, invitations, and compliments—it had been a release to get away from him.
But do not insist upon my being very agreeable, for my heart, you know, will be some forty miles off.
The fairness of your friend was an open attraction; her firmness, you know, could only be understood by yourself.” “You are laughing; but, I assure you, Isabella is very firm in general.” “It is as much as should be said of anyone.
James expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude; and the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could marry, being, however unwelcome, no more than he had expected, was borne by him without discontent.
For myself, it is nothing; I never think of myself.” “I know you never do, my dear; and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you.
There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you, my dear child—but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things.
The long, long, endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living.” “Yes, yes, my darling Isabella,” said Mrs. Thorpe, “we perfectly see into your heart.
We perfectly understand the present vexation; and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection.” Catherine’s uncomfortable feelings began to lessen.
She endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of Isabella’s regret; and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever, endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise.
CHAPTER 17 The Allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in Bath; and whether it should be the last was for some time a question, to which Catherine listened with a beating heart.
I know how much your heart is in it.
Her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness.
The circumstances of the morning had led Catherine’s feelings through the varieties of suspense, security, and disappointment; but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss; and with spirits elated to rapture, with Henry at her heart, and Northanger Abbey on her lips, she hurried home to write her letter.
The affection of Isabella was to be secured to her in a sister.
With all the chances against her of house, hall, place, park, court, and cottage, Northanger turned up an abbey, and she was to be its inhabitant.
Well, the thing is this: I have just had a letter from John; you can guess the contents.” “No, indeed, I cannot.” “My sweet love, do not be so abominably affected.
You know he is over head and ears in love with you.” “With _me_, dear Isabella!” “Nay, my sweetest Catherine, this is being quite absurd!
So it is in vain to affect ignorance.” Catherine, with all the earnestness of truth, expressed her astonishment at such a charge, protesting her innocence of every thought of Mr. Thorpe’s being in love with her, and the consequent impossibility of her having ever intended to encourage him.
Well, my dear Catherine, the case seems to be that you are determined against poor John—is not it so?” “I certainly cannot return his affection, and as certainly never meant to encourage it.” “Since that is the case, I am sure I shall not tease you any further.
A little harmless flirtation or so will occur, and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by.
If I could believe it—my spirit, you know, is pretty independent.” “I wish your heart were independent.
That would be enough for me.” “My heart, indeed!
It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella, and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him; unconsciously it must be, for Isabella’s attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement.
The compliment of John Thorpe’s affection did not make amends for this thoughtlessness in his sister.
That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her was a matter of lively astonishment.
She saw him grave and uneasy; and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart, to _her_ it was always an object.
In this distress, the intended departure of the Tilney family became her chief consolation; their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days, and Captain Tilney’s removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own.
No man is offended by another man’s admiration of the woman he loves; it is the woman only who can make it a torment.” Catherine blushed for her friend, and said, “Isabella is wrong.
She has been in love with him ever since they first met, and while my father’s consent was uncertain, she fretted herself almost into a fever.
You know she must be attached to him.” “I understand: she is in love with James, and flirts with Frederick.” “Oh no, not flirts.
A woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another.” “It is probable that she will neither love so well, nor flirt so well, as she might do either singly.
I only ask what I want to be told.” “But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell?” “Yes, I think so; for you must know your brother’s heart.” “My brother’s heart, as you term it, on the present occasion, I assure you I can only guess at.” “Well?” “Well!
Would he thank you, either on his own account or Miss Thorpe’s, for supposing that her affection, or at least her good behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney?
Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else?
Their hearts are open to each other, as neither heart can be to you; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant.” Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave, he added, “Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us, he will probably remain but a very short time, perhaps only a few days behind us.
Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart; but that at such a moment was allowable; and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction, and once she drew back her hand; but Catherine remembered Henry’s instructions, and placed it all to judicious affection.
“Are not you with her?” “Northanger is not more than half my home; I have an establishment at my own house in Woodston, which is nearly twenty miles from my father’s, and some of my time is necessarily spent there.” “How sorry you must be for that!” “I am always sorry to leave Eleanor.” “Yes; but besides your affection for her, you must be so fond of the abbey!
Have you a stout heart?
Will not your heart sink within you?” “Oh!
Her heart instantaneously at ease on this point, she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything, as she greatly dreaded disobliging the General by any delay.
Thus wisely fortifying her mind, as she proceeded upstairs, she was enabled, especially on perceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from her, to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart; and her spirits were immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire.
Again, therefore, she applied herself to the key, and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with the determined celerity of hope’s last effort, the door suddenly yielded to her hand: her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory, and having thrown open each folding door, the second being secured only by bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock, though in that her eye could not discern anything unusual, a double range of small drawers appeared in view, with some larger drawers above and below them; and in the centre, a small door, closed also with a lock and key, secured in all probability a cavity of importance.
Catherine’s heart beat quick, but her courage did not fail her.
Her heart fluttered, her knees trembled, and her cheeks grew pale.
i have just learnt to love a hyacinth.” “And how might you learn?
Mrs. Allen used to take pains, year after year, to make me like them; but I never could, till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street; I am naturally indifferent about flowers.” “But now you love a hyacinth.
And though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic, who can tell, the sentiment once raised, but you may in time come to love a rose?” “But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors.
Mamma says I am never within.” “At any rate, however, I am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth.
The mere habit of learning to love is the thing; and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing.
The whole building enclosed a large court; and two sides of the quadrangle, rich in Gothic ornaments, stood forward for admiration.
He loved a garden.
Though careless enough in most matters of eating, he loved good fruit—or if he did not, his friends and children did.
“I used to walk here so often with her!” added Eleanor; “though I never loved it then, as I have loved it since.
But her memory endears it now.” “And ought it not,” reflected Catherine, “to endear it to her husband?
“I was only thirteen when it happened; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it, I did not, I could not, then know what a loss it was.” She stopped for a moment, and then added, with great firmness, “I have no sister, you know—and though Henry—though my brothers are very affectionate, and Henry is a great deal here, which I am most thankful for, it is impossible for me not to be often solitary.” “To be sure you must miss him very much.” “A mother would have been always present.
Of her unhappiness in marriage, she felt persuaded.
He did not love her walk: could he therefore have loved her?
Large as was the building, she had already visited the greatest part; though, on being told that, with the addition of the kitchen, the six or seven rooms she had now seen surrounded three sides of the court, she could scarcely believe it, or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted.
It was some relief, however, that they were to return to the rooms in common use, by passing through a few of less importance, looking into the court, which, with occasional passages, not wholly unintricate, connected the different sides; and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister, having traces of cells pointed out, and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her—by finding herself successively in a billiard-room, and in the General’s private apartment, without comprehending their connection, or being able to turn aright when she left them; and lastly, by passing through a dark little room, owning Henry’s authority, and strewed with his litter of books, guns, and greatcoats.
To involve her in the danger of a second detection, to court her into an apartment which must wring her heart, could not be the office of a friend.
She was sick of exploring, and desired but to be safe in her own room, with her own heart only privy to its folly; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered, when the sound of footsteps, she could hardly tell where, made her pause and tremble.
During the progress of her disorder, Frederick and I (_we_ were both at home) saw her repeatedly; and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her, or which her situation in life could command.
He loved her, I am persuaded, as well as it was possible for him to—we have not all, you know, the same tenderness of disposition—and I will not pretend to say that while she lived, she might not often have had much to bear, but though his temper injured her, his judgment never did.
CHAPTER 25 The visions of romance were over.
He had—she thought he had, once or twice before this fatal morning, shown something like affection for her.
But now—in short, she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour, went down when the clock struck five, with a broken heart, and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to Eleanor’s inquiry if she was well.
She saw that the infatuation had been created, the mischief settled, long before her quitting Bath, and it seemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which she had there indulged.
Of the Alps and Pyrenees, with their pine forests and their vices, they might give a faithful delineation; and Italy, Switzerland, and the south of France might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there represented.
But in the central part of England there was surely some security for the existence even of a wife not beloved, in the laws of the land, and the manners of the age.
There were still some subjects, indeed, under which she believed they must always tremble—the mention of a chest or a cabinet, for instance—and she did not love the sight of japan in any shape: but even _she_ could allow that an occasional memento of past folly, however painful, might not be without use.
The anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of romance.
You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned.
let me soon hear from you, dear Catherine; you are my only friend; _your_ love I do build upon.
Poor Thorpe is in town: I dread the sight of him; his honest heart would feel so much.
I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it; but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved, I was that man.
Dearest Catherine, beware how you give your heart.
you will soon know why.” “To have so kind-hearted, so affectionate a sister,” replied Henry warmly, “must be a comfort to him under any distress.” “I have one favour to beg,” said Catherine, shortly afterwards, in an agitated manner, “that, if your brother should be coming here, you will give me notice of it, that I may go away.” “Our brother!
Isabella—no wonder _now_ I have not heard from her—Isabella has deserted my brother, and is to marry yours!
His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable.
I am very sorry for Mr. Morland—sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy; but my surprise would be greater at Frederick’s marrying her than at any other part of the story.” “It is very true, however; you shall read James’s letter yourself.
I do not envy his situation, either as a lover or a son.” Miss Tilney, at Catherine’s invitation, now read the letter likewise, and, having expressed also her concern and surprise, began to inquire into Miss Thorpe’s connections and fortune.
“But,” said Eleanor, after a short pause, “would it be to promote his happiness, to enable him to marry such a girl?
And how strange an infatuation on Frederick’s side!
Frederick too, who always wore his heart so proudly!
who found no woman good enough to be loved!” “That is the most unpromising circumstance, the strongest presumption against him.
You feel, I suppose, that in losing Isabella, you lose half yourself: you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy.
To say the truth, though I am hurt and grieved, that I cannot still love her, that I am never to hear from her, perhaps never to see her again, I do not feel so very, very much afflicted as one would have thought.” “You feel, as you always do, what is most to the credit of human nature.
CHAPTER 26 From this time, the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people; and Catherine found, with some surprise, that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella’s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother.
Two hours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston, I suppose; we shall be in the carriage by ten; so, about a quarter before one on Wednesday, you may look for us.” A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than this little excursion, so strong was her desire to be acquainted with Woodston; and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry, about an hour afterwards, came booted and greatcoated into the room where she and Eleanor were sitting, and said, “I am come, young ladies, in a very moralizing strain, to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for, and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage, giving ready-monied actual happiness for a draft on the future, that may not be honoured.
Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it, as the General seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country, and the size of the village; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at, and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage, and at all the little chandler’s shops which they passed.
Your kind offices will set all right: he is the only man I ever did or could love, and I trust you will convince him of it.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>She was ashamed of Isabella, and ashamed of having ever loved her.
As it happens, there is no great harm done, because I do not think Isabella has any heart to lose.
But, suppose he had made her very much in love with him?” “But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose—consequently to have been a very different creature; and, in that case, she would have met with very different treatment.” “It is very right that you should stand by your brother.” “And if you would stand by _yours_, you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe.
Such ease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and more every day; and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one, and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other, she would at each moment of each day have been perfectly happy; but she was now in the fourth week of her visit; before the General came home, the fourth week would be turned, and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she stayed much longer.
She did—almost always—believe that Henry loved her, and quite always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong to them; and believing so far, her doubts and anxieties were merely sportive irritations.
Catherine, supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney’s account, could only express her concern by silent attention, obliged her to be seated, rubbed her temples with lavender water, and hung over her with affectionate solicitude.
His unlooked-for return was enough in itself to make Catherine’s heart sink, and for a few moments she hardly supposed there were anything worse to be told.
after courting you from the protection of real friends to this—almost double distance from your home, to have you driven out of the house, without the considerations even of decent civility!
Let me be called in time.” Eleanor saw that she wished to be alone; and believing it better for each that they should avoid any further conversation, now left her with, “I shall see you in the morning.” Catherine’s swelling heart needed relief.
I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you.” But this, with the look of sorrow accompanying it, was enough to melt Catherine’s pride in a moment, and she instantly said, “Oh, Eleanor, I _will_ write to you indeed.” There was yet another point which Miss Tilney was anxious to settle, though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of.
It had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home, Catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey, and, upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation, it proved to be exactly the case.
The carriage was soon announced to be ready; and Catherine, instantly rising, a long and affectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu; and, as they entered the hall, unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either, she paused a moment, and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left “her kind remembrance for her absent friend.” But with this approach to his name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings; and, hiding her face as well as she could with her handkerchief, she darted across the hall, jumped into the chaise, and in a moment was driven from the door.
It was there, it was on that day, that the General had made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself, had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage.
Henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each.
From this, she was preserved too by another cause, by feeling no eagerness for her journey’s conclusion; for to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best, even after an absence such as hers—an eleven weeks’ absence.
She could never do justice to Henry and Eleanor’s merit; she felt it too strongly for expression; and should a dislike be taken against them, should they be thought of unfavourably, on their father’s account, it would cut her to the heart.
Her father, mother, Sarah, George, and Harriet, all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness, was a sight to awaken the best feelings of Catherine’s heart; and in the embrace of each, as she stepped from the carriage, she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible.
in the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued, and the pleasure of seeing her, leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity, they were all seated round the tea-table, which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller, whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice, before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her.
Without suffering any romantic alarm, in the consideration of their daughter’s long and lonely journey, Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasantness to her; that it was what they could never have voluntarily suffered; and that, in forcing her on such a measure, General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly—neither as a gentleman nor as a parent.
Why he had done it, what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality, and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will, was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as Catherine herself; but it did not oppress them by any means so long; and, after a due course of useless conjecture, that “it was a strange business, and that he must be a very strange man,” grew enough for all their indignation and wonder; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility, exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour.
They never once thought of her heart, which, for the parents of a young lady of seventeen, just returned from her first excursion from home, was odd enough!
The money therefore which Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks, and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart.
It was not three months ago since, wild with joyful expectation, she had there run backwards and forwards some ten times a day, with an heart light, gay, and independent; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed, and free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it.
She was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her unlooked-for appearance, acting on a steady affection, would naturally call forth; and great was their surprise, and warm their displeasure, on hearing how she had been treated—though Mrs. Morland’s account of it was no inflated representation, no studied appeal to their passions.
But no wonder; Milsom Street, you know.” As they walked home again, Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter’s mind the happiness of having such steady well-wishers as Mr. and Mrs. Allen, and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with her, while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends.
He did not address himself to an uncandid judge or a resentful heart.
He was not ill-inclined to obey this request, for, though his heart was greatly relieved by such unlooked-for mildness, it was not just at that moment in his power to say anything to the purpose.
Catherine meanwhile—the anxious, agitated, happy, feverish Catherine—said not a word; but her glowing cheek and brightened eye made her mother trust that this good-natured visit would at least set her heart at ease for a time, and gladly therefore did she lay aside the first volume of The Mirror for a future hour.
She was assured of his affection; and that heart in return was solicited, which, perhaps, they pretty equally knew was already entirely his own; for, though Henry was now sincerely attached to her, though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her society, I must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude, or, in other words, that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought.
It is a new circumstance in romance, I acknowledge, and dreadfully derogatory of an heroine’s dignity; but if it be as new in common life, the credit of a wild imagination will at least be all my own.
Under a mistaken persuasion of her possessions and claims, he had courted her acquaintance in Bath, solicited her company at Northanger, and designed her for his daughter-in-law.
Thorpe, most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of General Tilney’s importance, had been joyfully and proudly communicative; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland’s engaging Isabella, but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself, his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them.
That they were false, the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested them, from Thorpe himself, whom he had chanced to meet again in town, and who, under the influence of exactly opposite feelings, irritated by Catherine’s refusal, and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella, convinced that they were separated forever, and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable, hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands—confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character, misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit, whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families, with the most liberal proposals, he had, on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator, been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support.
He felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland, and believing that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain, no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent, no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger, could shake his fidelity, or influence the resolutions it prompted.
CHAPTER 31 Mr. and Mrs. Morland’s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was, for a few minutes, considerable, it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side; but as nothing, after all, could be more natural than Catherine’s being beloved, they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride, and, as far as they alone were concerned, had not a single objection to start.
Of a very considerable fortune, his son was, by marriage settlements, eventually secure; his present income was an income of independence and comfort, and under every pecuniary view, it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter.
They felt and they deplored—but they could not resent it; and they parted, endeavouring to hope that such a change in the General, as each believed almost impossible, might speedily take place, to unite them again in the fulness of privileged affection.
The anxiety, which in this state of their attachment must be the portion of Henry and Catherine, and of all who loved either, as to its final event, can hardly extend, I fear, to the bosom of my readers, who will see in the tell-tale compression of the pages before them, that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity.
The means by which their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt: what probable circumstance could work upon a temper like the General’s?
The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence, which took place in the course of the summer—an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour, from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry, and his permission for him “to be a fool if he liked it!” The marriage of Eleanor Tilney, her removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been made by Henry’s banishment, to the home of her choice and the man of her choice, is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance.
His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties; and never had the General loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship, utility, and patient endurance as when he first hailed her “Your Ladyship!” Her husband was really deserving of her; independent of his peerage, his wealth, and his attachment, being to a precision the most charming young man in the world.
On the strength of this, the General, soon after Eleanor’s marriage, permitted his son to return to Northanger, and thence made him the bearer of his consent, very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland.
The event which it authorized soon followed: Henry and Catherine were married, the bells rang, and everybody smiled; and, as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their meeting, it will not appear, after all the dreadful delays occasioned by the General’s cruelty, that they were essentially hurt by it.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I know a man must have the love o’ God in his soul, and the Bible’s God’s word.
There was no keenness in the eyes; they seemed rather to be shedding love than making observations; they had the liquid look which tells that the mind is full of what it has to give out, rather than impressed by external objects.
The eyes had no peculiar beauty, beyond that of expression; they looked so simple, so candid, so gravely loving, that no accusing scowl, no light sneer could help melting away before their glance.
Joshua Rann gave a long cough, as if he were clearing his throat in order to come to a new understanding with himself; Chad Cranage lifted up his leather skull-cap and scratched his head; and Wiry Ben wondered how Seth had the pluck to think of courting her.
And he gave us our souls and put love between parents and children, and husband and wife.
Not but what he did good to the rich too, for he was full of love to all men, only he saw as the poor were more in want of his help.
“Ah, wouldn’t you love such a man if you saw him—if he were here in this village?
What a kind heart he must have!
So then, all the love that Jesus showed to the poor is the same love that God has for us.
But our blessed Saviour has showed us what God is in a way us poor ignorant people can understand; he has showed us what God’s heart is, what are his feelings towards us.
Her pale face became paler; the circles under her eyes deepened, as they did when tears half-gather without falling; and the mild loving eyes took an expression of appalled pity, as if she had suddenly discerned a destroying angel hovering over the heads of the people.
She appealed first to one and then to another, beseeching them with tears to turn to God while there was yet time; painting to them the desolation of their souls, lost in sin, feeding on the husks of this miserable world, far away from God their Father; and then the love of the Saviour, who was waiting and watching for their return.
The gentle tones, the loving persuasion, did not touch her, but when the more severe appeals came she began to be frightened.
Now he looks at you with love and mercy and says, ‘Come to me that you may have life’; then he will turn away from you, and say, ‘Depart from me into ever-lasting fire!’” Poor Bessy’s wide-open black eyes began to fill with tears, her great red cheeks and lips became quite pale, and her face was distorted like a little child’s before a burst of crying.
_She_ thought of her lace caps and saved all her money to buy ’em; she thought nothing about how she might get a clean heart and a right spirit—she only wanted to have better lace than other girls.
But now Dinah began to tell of the joys that were in store for the penitent, and to describe in her simple way the divine peace and love with which the soul of the believer is filled—how the sense of God’s love turns poverty into riches and satisfies the soul so that no uneasy desire vexes it, no fear alarms it: how, at last, the very temptation to sin is extinguished, and heaven is begun upon earth, because no cloud passes between the soul and God, who is its eternal sun.
“Dear friends,” she said at last, “brothers and sisters, whom I love as those for whom my Lord has died, believe me, I know what this great blessedness is; and because I know it, I want you to have it too.
I am poor, like you: I have to get my living with my hands; but no lord nor lady can be so happy as me, if they haven’t got the love of God in their souls.
Think what it is—not to hate anything but sin; to be full of love to every creature; to be frightened at nothing; to be sure that all things will turn to good; not to mind pain, because it is our Father’s will; to know that nothing—no, not if the earth was to be burnt up, or the waters come and drown us—nothing could part us from God who loves us, and who fills our souls with peace and joy, because we are sure that whatever he wills is holy, just, and good.
God is without end; his love is without end—” Its streams the whole creation reach, So plenteous is the store; Enough for all, enough for each, Enough for evermore.
It was an expression of unconscious placid gravity—of absorption in thoughts that had no connection with the present moment or with her own personality—an expression that is most of all discouraging to a lover.
But another thought gave him courage: “There’s no man could love her better and leave her freer to follow the Lord’s work.” They had been silent for many minutes now, since they had done talking about Bessy Cranage; Dinah seemed almost to have forgotten Seth’s presence, and her pace was becoming so much quicker that the sense of their being only a few minutes’ walk from the yard-gates of the Hall Farm at last gave Seth courage to speak.
And this morning when I opened the Bible for direction, the first words my eyes fell on were, ‘And after we had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia.’ If it wasn’t for that clear showing of the Lord’s will, I should be loath to go, for my heart yearns over my aunt and her little ones, and that poor wandering lamb Hetty Sorrel.
“For I doubt Adam’s heart is so set on her, he’ll never turn to anybody else; and yet it ’ud go to my heart if he was to marry her, for I canna think as she’d make him happy.
It’s a deep mystery—the way the heart of man turns to one woman out of all the rest he’s seen i’ the world, and makes it easier for him to work seven year for _her_, like Jacob did for Rachel, sooner than have any other woman for th’ asking.
I often think of them words, ‘And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days for the love he had to her.’ I know those words ’ud come true with me, Dinah, if so be you’d give me hope as I might win you after seven years was over.
I know you think a husband ’ud be taking up too much o’ your thoughts, because St. Paul says, ‘She that’s married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband’; and may happen you’ll think me overbold to speak to you about it again, after what you told me o’ your mind last Saturday.
And it seems to me there’s more texts for your marrying than ever you can find against it.
For St. Paul says as plain as can be in another place, ‘I will that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully’; and then ‘two are better than one’; and that holds good with marriage as well as with other things.
For we should be o’ one heart and o’ one mind, Dinah.
They had reached one of those very narrow passes between two tall stones, which performed the office of a stile in Loamshire, and Dinah paused as she turned towards Seth and said, in her tender but calm treble notes, “Seth Bede, I thank you for your love towards me, and if I could think of any man as more than a Christian brother, I think it would be you.
But my heart is not free to marry.
I’ve not turned a deaf ear to your words, Seth, for when I saw as your love was given to me, I thought it might be a leading of Providence for me to change my way of life, and that we should be fellow-helpers; and I spread the matter before the Lord.
But whenever I tried to fix my mind on marriage, and our living together, other thoughts always came in—the times when I’ve prayed by the sick and dying, and the happy hours I’ve had preaching, when my heart was filled with love, and the Word was given to me abundantly.
I believe what you say, Seth, that you would try to be a help and not a hindrance to my work; but I see that our marriage is not God’s will—He draws my heart another way.
I seem to have no room in my soul for wants and fears of my own, it has pleased God to fill my heart so full with the wants and sufferings of his poor people.” Seth was unable to reply, and they walked on in silence.
I think it’s something passing the love of women as I feel for you, for I could be content without your marrying me if I could go and live at Snowfield and be near you.
I trusted as the strong love God has given me towards you was a leading for us both; but it seems it was only meant for my trial.
Farewell.” Dinah pressed his hand with rather a sad look in her loving eyes, and then passed through the gate, while Seth turned away to walk lingeringly home.
He was but three-and-twenty, and had only just learned what it is to love—to love with that adoration which a young man gives to a woman whom he feels to be greater and better than himself.
What deep and worthy love is so, whether of woman or child, or art or music.
Our caresses, our tender words, our still rapture under the influence of autumn sunsets, or pillared vistas, or calm majestic statues, or Beethoven symphonies all bring with them the consciousness that they are mere waves and ripples in an unfathomable ocean of love and beauty; our emotion in its keenest moment passes from expression into silence, our love at its highest flood rushes beyond its object and loses itself in the sense of divine mystery.
And this blessed gift of venerating love has been given to too many humble craftsmen since the world began for us to feel any surprise that it should have existed in the soul of a Methodist carpenter half a century ago, while there was yet a lingering after-glow from the time when Wesley and his fellow-labourer fed on the hips and haws of the Cornwall hedges, after exhausting limbs and lungs in carrying a divine message to the poor.
That afterglow has long faded away; and the picture we are apt to make of Methodism in our imagination is not an amphitheatre of green hills, or the deep shade of broad-leaved sycamores, where a crowd of rough men and weary-hearted women drank in a faith which was a rudimentary culture, which linked their thoughts with the past, lifted their imagination above the sordid details of their own narrow lives, and suffused their souls with the sense of a pitying, loving, infinite Presence, sweet as summer to the houseless needy.
Lisbeth Bede loves her son with the love of a woman to whom her first-born has come late in life.
“Nay, my lad, my lad, thee wouldstna go away an’ break thy mother’s heart, an’ leave thy feyther to ruin.
But leave me alone, Mother, and let me get on with the work.” Lisbeth dared not say any more; but she got up and called Gyp, thinking to console herself somewhat for Adam’s refusal of the supper she had spread out in the loving expectation of looking at him while he ate it, by feeding Adam’s dog with extra liberality.
We are apt to be kinder to the brutes that love us than to the women that love us.
Depend upon it, he meant a good creature, who had no joy but in the happiness of the loved ones whom she contributed to make uncomfortable, putting by all the tid-bits for them and spending nothing on herself.
But a certain awe mingled itself with her idolatrous love of Adam, and when he said, “Leave me alone,” she was always silenced.
So he turned, with rather a heavy heart, into the house-place.
He loves a bit o’ taters an’ gravy.
He may say such a thing when he’s in wrath—and he’s got excuse for being wrathful sometimes—but his heart ’ud never let him go.
Think how he’s stood by us all when it’s been none so easy—paying his savings to free me from going for a soldier, an’ turnin’ his earnin’s into wood for father, when he’s got plenty o’ uses for his money, and many a young man like him ’ud ha’ been married and settled before now.
“He’s set’s heart on that Hetty Sorrel, as ’ull niver save a penny, an’ ’ull toss up her head at’s old mother.
An’ to think as he might ha’ Mary Burge, an’ be took partners, an’ be a big man wi’ workmen under him, like Mester Burge—Dolly’s told me so o’er and o’er again—if it warna as he’s set’s heart on that bit of a wench, as is o’ no more use nor the gillyflower on the wall.
An’ he so wise at bookin’ an’ figurin’, an’ not to know no better nor that!” “But, Mother, thee know’st we canna love just where other folks ’ud have us.
There’s nobody but God can control the heart of man.
A pig may poke his nose into the trough and think o’ nothing outside it; but if you’ve got a man’s heart and soul in you, you can’t be easy a-making your own bed an’ leaving the rest to lie on the stones.
Adam’s heart rose to his mouth: the vague anxiety about his father was changed into a great dread.
If it had not been a wet morning, Mr. Irwine would not have been in the dining-room playing at chess with his mother, and he loves both his mother and chess quite well enough to pass some cloudy hours very easily by their help.
He bore the same sort of resemblance to his mother that our loving memory of a friend’s face often bears to the face itself: the lines were all more generous, the smile brighter, the expression heartier.
“An’ Seth Bede’s been to me this morning to say he wished me to tell Your Reverence as his brother Adam begged of you particular t’ allow his father’s grave to be dug by the White Thorn, because his mother’s set her heart on it, on account of a dream as she had; an’ they’d ha’ come theirselves to ask you, but they’ve so much to see after with the crowner, an’ that; an’ their mother’s took on so, an’ wants ’em to make sure o’ the spot for fear somebody else should take it.
She had set her heart on that, sweet soul!
Mr. Irwine went to the bedside and took up one of the delicate hands and kissed it, a slight pressure from the small fingers told him that it was worth-while to have come upstairs for the sake of doing that.
Miss Anne, indeed, if her chronic headaches could have been accounted for by a pathetic story of disappointed love, might have had some romantic interest attached to her: but no such story had either been known or invented concerning her, and the general impression was quite in accordance with the fact, that both the sisters were old maids for the prosaic reason that they had never received an eligible offer.
On the other hand, I must plead, for I have an affectionate partiality towards the rector’s memory, that he was not vindictive—and some philanthropists have been so; that he was not intolerant—and there is a rumour that some zealous theologians have not been altogether free from that blemish; that although he would probably have declined to give his body to be burned in any public cause, and was far from bestowing all his goods to feed the poor, he had that charity which has sometimes been lacking to very illustrious virtue—he was tender to other men’s failings, and unwilling to impute evil.
You’re never easy till you’ve got some sweetheart as is as big a fool as yourself: you think you’ll be finely off when you’re married, I daresay, and have got a three-legged stool to sit on, and never a blanket to cover you, and a bit o’ oat-cake for your dinner, as three children are a-snatching at.” “I’m sure I donna want t’ go wi’ the whittaws,” said Molly, whimpering, and quite overcome by this Dantean picture of her future, “on’y we allays used to comb the wool for ’n at Mester Ottley’s; an’ so I just axed ye.
And she was just the same from the first o’ my remembering her; it made no difference in her, as I could see, when she took to the Methodists, only she talked a bit different and wore a different sort o’ cap; but she’d never in her life spent a penny on herself more than keeping herself decent.” “She was a blessed woman,” said Dinah; “God had given her a loving, self-forgetting nature, and He perfected it by grace.
When she had that bad illness, and I was only eleven years old, she used to say, ‘You’ll have a friend on earth in your Aunt Rachel, if I’m taken from you, for she has a kind heart,’ and I’m sure I’ve found it so.” “I don’t know how, child; anybody ’ud be cunning to do anything for you, I think; you’re like the birds o’ th’ air, and live nobody knows how.
And then you might get married to some decent man, and there’d be plenty ready to have you, if you’d only leave off that preaching, as is ten times worse than anything your Aunt Judith ever did.
And even if you’d marry Seth Bede, as is a poor wool-gathering Methodist and’s never like to have a penny beforehand, I know your uncle ’ud help you with a pig, and very like a cow, for he’s allays been good-natur’d to my kin, for all they’re poor, and made ’em welcome to the house; and ’ud do for you, I’ll be bound, as much as ever he’d do for Hetty, though she’s his own niece.
I can no more help spending my life in trying to do what I can for the souls of others, than you could help running if you heard little Totty crying at the other end of the house; the voice would go to your heart, you would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger, and you couldn’t rest without running to help her and comfort her.” “Ah,” said Mrs. Poyser, rising and walking towards the door, “I know it ’ud be just the same if I was to talk to you for hours.
I think yours is the prettiest farm on the estate, though; and do you know, Mrs. Poyser, if I were going to marry and settle, I should be tempted to turn you out, and do up this fine old house, and turn farmer myself.” “Oh, sir,” said Mrs. Poyser, rather alarmed, “you wouldn’t like it at all.
Mrs. Fletcher, as you may have heard about, was the first woman to preach in the Society, I believe, before she was married, when she was Miss Bosanquet; and Mr. Wesley approved of her undertaking the work.
They don’t go every one his own way and say, ‘Am I my brother’s keeper?’” “But tell me—if I may ask, and I am really interested in knowing it—how you first came to think of preaching?” “Indeed, sir, I didn’t think of it at all—I’d been used from the time I was sixteen to talk to the little children, and teach them, and sometimes I had had my heart enlarged to speak in class, and was much drawn out in prayer with the sick.
It’s better than twelve miles from Snowfield, so we set out early in the morning, for it was summertime; and I had a wonderful sense of the Divine love as we walked over the hills, where there’s no trees, you know, sir, as there is here, to make the sky look smaller, but you see the heavens stretched out like a tent, and you feel the everlasting arms around you.
Did you find them quiet and attentive?” “Very quiet, sir, but I saw no signs of any great work upon them, except in a young girl named Bessy Cranage, towards whom my heart yearned greatly, when my eyes first fell on her blooming youth, given up to folly and vanity.
I had some private talk and prayer with her afterwards, and I trust her heart is touched.
“She will mourn heavily, for Seth has told me she’s of an anxious, troubled heart.
Perhaps I can be of use to her, so I have fetched my bonnet and am going to set out.” “Dear heart, dear heart!

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bright, admiring glances from a handsome young gentleman with white hands, a gold chain, occasional regimentals, and wealth and grandeur immeasurable—those were the warm rays that set poor Hetty’s heart vibrating and playing its little foolish tunes over and over again.
She was aware, too, that Mr. Craig, the gardener at the Chase, was over head and ears in love with her, and had lately made unmistakable avowals in luscious strawberries and hyperbolical peas.
Hetty was quite certain her uncle wanted her to encourage Adam, and would be pleased for her to marry him.
Mester Burge is in the right on’t to want him to go partners and marry his daughter, if it’s true what they say; the woman as marries him ’ull have a good take, be’t Lady day or Michaelmas,” a remark which Mrs. Poyser always followed up with her cordial assent.
I allays said I’d never marry a man as had got no brains; for where’s the use of a woman having brains of her own if she’s tackled to a geck as everybody’s a-laughing at?
But as to marrying Adam, that was a very different affair!
Her cheeks never grew a shade deeper when his name was mentioned; she felt no thrill when she saw him passing along the causeway by the window, or advancing towards her unexpectedly in the footpath across the meadow; she felt nothing, when his eyes rested on her, but the cold triumph of knowing that he loved her and would not care to look at Mary Burge.
He could no more stir in her the emotions that make the sweet intoxication of young love than the mere picture of a sun can stir the spring sap in the subtle fibres of the plant.
She thought, if Adam had been rich and could have given her these things, she loved him well enough to marry him.
The poor child no more conceived at present the idea that the young squire could ever be her lover than a baker’s pretty daughter in the crowd, whom a young emperor distinguishes by an imperial but admiring smile, conceives that she shall be made empress.
The little puss seems already to have airs enough to make a husband as miserable as it’s a law of nature for a quiet man to be when he marries a beauty.
Apropos of marrying, I hope our friend Adam will get settled, now the poor old man’s gone.
When I’ve made up my mind that I can’t afford to buy a tempting dog, I take no notice of him, because if he took a strong fancy to me and looked lovingly at me, the struggle between arithmetic and inclination might become unpleasantly severe.
Lisbeth had even mended a long-neglected and unnoticeable rent in the checkered bit of bed-curtain; for the moments were few and precious now in which she would be able to do the smallest office of respect or love for the still corpse, to which in all her thoughts she attributed some consciousness.
Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them: they can be injured by us, they can be wounded; they know all our penitence, all our aching sense that their place is empty, all the kisses we bestow on the smallest relic of their presence.
An’ him to be drownded in the brook as we passed o’er the day we war married an’ come home together, an’ he’d made them lots o’ shelves for me to put my plates an’ things on, an’ showed ’em me as proud as could be, ’cause he know’d I should be pleased.
An’ us as war young folks once, an’ thought we should do rarely when we war married.
“I know thee couldst do better wi’out me, for thee couldst go where thee likedst an’ marry them as thee likedst.
An’ if thee’st set thy heart on a lass as’ll bring thee nought and waste all, when thee mightst ha’ them as ’ud make a man on thee, I’ll say nought, now thy feyther’s dead an’ drownded, for I’m no better nor an old haft when the blade’s gone.” Adam, unable to bear this any longer, rose silently from the bench and walked out of the workshop into the kitchen.
Dinah, believing that this pause of wonder was in itself a relief for the sorrowing woman, said no more just yet, but quietly took off her bonnet, and then, motioning silence to Seth, who, on hearing her voice, had come in with a beating heart, laid one hand on the back of Lisbeth’s chair and leaned over her, that she might be aware of a friendly presence.
She saw nothing at first but a face—a pure, pale face, with loving grey eyes, and it was quite unknown to her.
You know Mrs. Poyser—she’s my aunt, and she has heard of your great affliction, and is very sorry; and I’m come to see if I can be any help to you in your trouble; for I know your sons Adam and Seth, and I know you have no daughter; and when the clergyman told me how the hand of God was heavy upon you, my heart went out towards you, and I felt a command to come and be to you in the place of a daughter in this grief, if you will let me.” “Ah!
It would be hardness of heart to say that your trouble was not heavy to bear.
She had no children, for she was never married and she brought me up as tenderly as if I’d been her own child.” “Eh, she’d fine work wi’ ye, I’ll warrant, bringin’ ye up from a babby, an’ her a lone woman—it’s ill bringin’ up a cade lamb.
But the heart of man is the same everywhere, and there are the children of this world and the children of light there as well as elsewhere.
And so there was earnest prayer—there was faith, love, and hope pouring forth that evening in the little kitchen.
And poor, aged, fretful Lisbeth, without grasping any distinct idea, without going through any course of religious emotions, felt a vague sense of goodness and love, and of something right lying underneath and beyond all this sorrowing life.
Adam had seen Dinah several times, but always at the Hall Farm, where he was not very vividly conscious of any woman’s presence except Hetty’s, and he had only in the last day or two begun to suspect that Seth was in love with her, so that his attention had not hitherto been drawn towards her for his brother’s sake.
But I can stay here all to-day, if your mother would like me; and her heart seemed inclined towards me last night.” “Ah, then, she’s sure to want you to-day.
Come, then,” she added, in a tone of complaining affection, as Dinah sat down by her side, “I’ll be loath for ye t’ go, but ye canna stay much longer, I doubt.
It seems to me as if that was heaven where there’s always joy and sunshine, though this life’s dark and cloudy.” “Oh, I love the Stonyshire side,” said Dinah; “I shouldn’t like to set my face towards the countries where they’re rich in corn and cattle, and the ground so level and easy to tread; and to turn my back on the hills where the poor people have to live such a hard life and the men spend their days in the mines away from the sunlight.
It’s very blessed on a bleak cold day, when the sky is hanging dark over the hill, to feel the love of God in one’s soul, and carry it to the lonely, bare, stone houses, where there’s nothing else to give comfort.” “Eh!” said Lisbeth, “that’s very well for ye to talk, as looks welly like the snowdrop-flowers as ha’ lived for days an’ days when I’n gethered ’em, wi’ nothin’ but a drop o’ water an’ a peep o’ daylight; but th’ hungry foulks had better leave th’ hungry country.
I can come back at noon, and then he can go.” “Nay, nay,” persisted Lisbeth, beginning to cry, “I’n set my heart on’t as thee shalt ma’ thy feyther’s coffin.
As soon as she was gone, he said, “I don’t wonder at thee for loving her, Seth.
She’s got a face like a lily.” Seth’s soul rushed to his eyes and lips: he had never yet confessed his secret to Adam, but now he felt a delicious sense of disburdenment, as he answered, “Aye, Addy, I do love her—too much, I doubt.
But she doesna love me, lad, only as one child o’ God loves another.
She’ll never love any man as a husband—that’s my belief.” “Nay, lad, there’s no telling; thee mustna lose heart.
“I shall take you with me, Pym, and set off this morning; so be ready by half-past eleven.” The low whistle, which had assisted him in arriving at this resolution, here broke out into his loudest ringing tenor, and the corridor, as he hurried along it, echoed to his favourite song from the Beggar’s Opera, “When the heart of a man is oppressed with care.” Not an heroic strain; nevertheless Arthur felt himself very heroic as he strode towards the stables to give his orders about the horses.
He was nothing if not good-natured; and all his pictures of the future, when he should come into the estate, were made up of a prosperous, contented tenantry, adoring their landlord, who would be the model of an English gentleman—mansion in first-rate order, all elegance and high taste—jolly housekeeping, finest stud in Loamshire—purse open to all public objects—in short, everything as different as possible from what was now associated with the name of Donnithorne.
His hearty affection for the rector dated from the age of frocks and trousers.
It was an affection partly filial, partly fraternal—fraternal enough to make him like Irwine’s company better than that of most younger men, and filial enough to make him shrink strongly from incurring Irwine’s disapprobation.
To be shut up at the Chase with a broken arm when every other fellow in his regiment was enjoying himself at Windsor—shut up with his grandfather, who had the same sort of affection for him as for his parchment deeds!
It was a pity they were not in that golden age of childhood when they would have stood face to face, eyeing each other with timid liking, then given each other a little butterfly kiss, and toddled off to play together.
Love is such a simple thing when we have only one-and-twenty summers and a sweet girl of seventeen trembles under our glance, as if she were a bud first opening her heart with wondering rapture to the morning.
He hurried to the Hermitage, which stood in the heart of the wood, unlocked the door with a hasty wrench, slammed it after him, pitched _Zeluco_ into the most distant corner, and thrusting his right hand into his pocket, first walked four or five times up and down the scanty length of the little room, and then seated himself on the ottoman in an uncomfortable stiff way, as we often do when we wish not to abandon ourselves to feeling.
He was getting in love with Hetty—that was quite plain.
She enters the wood, where it is already twilight, and at every step she takes, the fear at her heart becomes colder.
She is beginning to cry: her heart has swelled so, the tears stand in her eyes; she gives one great sob, while the corners of her mouth quiver, and the tears roll down.
That look was too much: he must have had eyes of Egyptian granite not to look too lovingly in return.
He may be a shepherd in Arcadia for aught he knows, he may be the first youth kissing the first maiden, he may be Eros himself, sipping the lips of Psyche—it is all one.
Then they looked at each other, not quite as they had looked before, for in their eyes there was the memory of a kiss.
To flirt with Hetty was a very different affair from flirting with a pretty girl of his own station: that was understood to be an amusement on both sides, or, if it became serious, there was no obstacle to marriage.
No gentleman, out of a ballad, could marry a farmer’s niece.
Eh, I wouldna mind ha’in a daughter like that; but nobody ne’er marries them as is good for aught.” “Well, Mother, I hope thee wilt have her for a daughter; for Seth’s got a liking for her, and I hope she’ll get a liking for Seth in time.” “Where’s th’ use o’ talkin’ a-that’n?
But that’s the way; folks mun allays choose by contrairies, as if they must be sorted like the pork—a bit o’ good meat wi’ a bit o’ offal.” To the feminine mind in some of its moods, all things that might be receive a temporary charm from comparison with what is; and since Adam did not want to marry Dinah himself, Lisbeth felt rather peevish on that score—as peevish as she would have been if he _had_ wanted to marry her, and so shut himself out from Mary Burge and the partnership as effectually as by marrying Hetty.
“Seth Bede would have come and spoken to you, my dear,” she said, as she reached Hetty, “but he’s very full of trouble to-night.” Hetty answered with a dimpled smile, as if she did not quite know what had been said; and it made a strange contrast to see that sparkling self-engrossed loveliness looked at by Dinah’s calm pitying face, with its open glance which told that her heart lived in no cherished secrets of its own, but in feelings which it longed to share with all the world.
And then my heart is drawn out towards them, and I feel their lot as if it was my own, and I take comfort in spreading it before the Lord and resting in His love, on their behalf as well as my own.
And I’m sure he has a loving spirit too.
Her son Adam’s been at home all day, working at his father’s coffin, and she loves to have him at home.
She has a loving heart, though she’s sorely given to fret and be fearful.
But Totty only cried louder, and said, “Don’t yock!” So the mother, with that wondrous patience which love gives to the quickest temperament, sat up again, and pressed her cheek against the linen night-cap and kissed it, and forgot to scold Hetty any longer.
The vainest woman is never thoroughly conscious of her own beauty till she is loved by the man who sets her own passion vibrating in return.
Captain Donnithorne couldn’t like her to go on doing work: he would like to see her in nice clothes, and thin shoes, and white stockings, perhaps with silk clocks to them; for he must love her very much—no one else had ever put his arm round her and kissed her in that way.
He would want to marry her and make a lady of her; she could hardly dare to shape the thought—yet how else could it be?
Marry her quite secretly, as Mr. James, the doctor’s assistant, married the doctor’s niece, and nobody ever found it out for a long while after, and then it was of no use to be angry.
It would be the easiest folly in the world to fall in love with her: there is such a sweet babylike roundness about her face and figure; the delicate dark rings of hair lie so charmingly about her ears and neck; her great dark eyes with their long eye-lashes touch one so strangely, as if an imprisoned frisky sprite looked out of them.
Her heart must be just as soft, her temper just as free from angles, her character just as pliant.
And the lover himself thinks so too: the little darling is so fond of him, her little vanities are so bewitching, he wouldn’t consent to her being a bit wiser; those kittenlike glances and movements are just what one wants to make one’s hearth a paradise.
It is a marriage such as they made in the golden age, when the men were all wise and majestic and the women all lovely and loving.
If ever she behaved with cold vanity towards him, he said to himself it is only because she doesn’t love me well enough; and he was sure that her love, whenever she gave it, would be the most precious thing a man could possess on earth.
No: people who love downy peaches are apt not to think of the stone, and sometimes jar their teeth terribly against it.
He felt sure she was a dear, affectionate, good little thing.
The man who awakes the wondering tremulous passion of a young girl always thinks her affectionate; and if he chances to look forward to future years, probably imagines himself being virtuously tender to her, because the poor thing is so clingingly fond of him.
They are but dim ill-defined pictures that her narrow bit of an imagination can make of the future; but of every picture she is the central figure in fine clothes; Captain Donnithorne is very close to her, putting his arm round her, perhaps kissing her, and everybody else is admiring and envying her—especially Mary Burge, whose new print dress looks very contemptible by the side of Hetty’s resplendent toilette.
Does any sweet or sad memory mingle with this dream of the future—any loving thought of her second parents—of the children she had helped to tend—of any youthful companion, any pet animal, any relic of her own childhood even?
And we found her wi’ her little shoes stuck i’ the mud an’ crying fit to break her heart by the far horse-pit.
It’s my belief her heart’s as hard as a pebble.” “Nay, nay,” said Mr. Poyser, “thee mustn’t judge Hetty too hard.
It was well: for there now came a light tap, and Hetty, with a leaping heart, rushed to blow out the candles and throw them into the drawer.
Her heart was very full, for there was to be only one more night on which she would look out on those fields for a long time to come; but she thought little of leaving the mere scene, for, to her, bleak Snowfield had just as many charms.
She thought of all the dear people whom she had learned to care for among these peaceful fields, and who would now have a place in her loving remembrance for ever.
She began slowly to undress; but now, owing to the suggestions of this sound, her thoughts became concentrated on Hetty—that sweet young thing, with life and all its trials before her—the solemn daily duties of the wife and mother—and her mind so unprepared for them all, bent merely on little foolish, selfish pleasures, like a child hugging its toys in the beginning of a long toilsome journey in which it will have to bear hunger and cold and unsheltered darkness.
Dinah felt a double care for Hetty, because she shared Seth’s anxious interest in his brother’s lot, and she had not come to the conclusion that Hetty did not love Adam well enough to marry him.
She saw too clearly the absence of any warm, self-devoting love in Hetty’s nature to regard the coldness of her behaviour towards Adam as any indication that he was not the man she would like to have for a husband.
Still she hesitated; she was not quite certain of a divine direction; the voice that told her to go to Hetty seemed no stronger than the other voice which said that Hetty was weary, and that going to her now in an unseasonable moment would only tend to close her heart more obstinately.
The first words she looked at were those at the top of the left-hand page: “And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him.” That was enough for Dinah; she had opened on that memorable parting at Ephesus, when Paul had felt bound to open his heart in a last exhortation and warning.
Dinah, covered with her long white dress, her pale face full of subdued emotion, almost like a lovely corpse into which the soul has returned charged with sublimer secrets and a sublimer love.
They were nearly of the same height; Dinah evidently a little the taller as she put her arm round Hetty’s waist and kissed her forehead.
I want to tell you that if ever you are in trouble, and need a friend that will always feel for you and love you, you have got that friend in Dinah Morris at Snowfield, and if you come to her, or send for her, she’ll never forget this night and the words she is speaking to you now.
Do you know of anything?” Hetty had seated herself as she tied on her cap, and now Dinah leaned forwards and took her hands as she answered, “Because, dear, trouble comes to us all in this life: we set our hearts on things which it isn’t God’s will for us to have, and then we go sorrowing; the people we love are taken from us, and we can joy in nothing because they are not with us; sickness comes, and we faint under the burden of our feeble bodies; we go astray and do wrong, and bring ourselves into trouble with our fellow-men.
Hetty sat quite still; she felt no response within herself to Dinah’s anxious affection; but Dinah’s words uttered with solemn pathetic distinctness, affected her with a chill fear.
She kissed the sobbing thing, and began to cry with her for grateful joy.
But Hetty was simply in that excitable state of mind in which there is no calculating what turn the feelings may take from one moment to another, and for the first time she became irritated under Dinah’s caress.
Good-night.” She went out of the room almost as quietly and quickly as if she had been a ghost; but once by the side of her own bed, she threw herself on her knees and poured out in deep silence all the passionate pity that filled her heart.
However, Arthur Donnithorne, as he winds among the pleasant lanes on horseback in the morning sunshine, has a sincere determination to open his heart to the rector, and the swirling sound of the scythe as he passes by the meadow is all the pleasanter to him because of this honest purpose.
I will not say that his love for that good fellow did not owe some of its force to the love of patronage: our friend Arthur liked to do everything that was handsome, and to have his handsome deeds recognized.
Thus there was both respect and affection in the smile with which he raised his paper cap as Arthur Donnithorne rode up.
Only don’t set your heart too strongly on the goodwill you are to get in consequence.
For my part, I couldn’t live in a neighbourhood where I was not respected and beloved.
And if fair allowances were made to them, and their buildings attended to, one could persuade them to farm on a better plan, stupid as they are.” “Then mind you fall in love in the right place, and don’t get a wife who will drain your purse and make you niggardly in spite of yourself.
My mother and I have a little discussion about you sometimes: she says, ‘I’ll never risk a single prophecy on Arthur until I see the woman he falls in love with.’ She thinks your lady-love will rule you as the moon rules the tides.
He was of an impressible nature, and lived a great deal in other people’s opinions and feelings concerning himself; and the mere fact that he was in the presence of an intimate friend, who had not the slightest notion that he had had any such serious internal struggle as he came to confide, rather shook his own belief in the seriousness of the struggle.
It had required no noticeable pause for this rush and rebound of feeling, before he answered, “But I think it is hardly an argument against a man’s general strength of character that he should be apt to be mastered by love.
A man may be very firm in other matters and yet be under a sort of witchery from a woman.” “Yes; but there’s this difference between love and smallpox, or bewitchment either—that if you detect the disease at an early stage and try change of air, there is every chance of complete escape without any further development of symptoms.
I daresay, now, even a man fortified with a knowledge of the classics might be lured into an imprudent marriage, in spite of the warning given him by the chorus in the Prometheus.” The smile that flitted across Arthur’s face was a faint one, and instead of following Mr. Irwine’s playful lead, he said, quite seriously—“Yes, that’s the worst of it.
His honest, patronizing pride in the good-will and respect of everybody about him was a safeguard even against foolish romance, still more against a lower kind of folly.
These fellow-mortals, every one, must be accepted as they are: you can neither straighten their noses, nor brighten their wit, nor rectify their dispositions; and it is these people—amongst whom your life is passed—that it is needful you should tolerate, pity, and love: it is these more or less ugly, stupid, inconsistent people whose movements of goodness you should be able to admire—for whom you should cherish all possible hopes, all possible patience.
What clumsy, ugly people!” But bless us, things may be lovable that are not altogether handsome, I hope?
Yet there is a great deal of family love amongst us.
I have a friend or two whose class of features is such that the Apollo curl on the summit of their brows would be decidedly trying; yet to my certain knowledge tender hearts have beaten for them, and their miniatures—flattering, but still not lovely—are kissed in secret by motherly lips.
I have seen many an excellent matron, who could have never in her best days have been handsome, and yet she had a packet of yellow love-letters in a private drawer, and sweet children showered kisses on her sallow cheeks.
And I believe there have been plenty of young heroes, of middle stature and feeble beards, who have felt quite sure they could never love anything more insignificant than a Diana, and yet have found themselves in middle life happily settled with a wife who waddles.
But let us love that other beauty too, which lies in no secret of proportion, but in the secret of deep human sympathy.
Therefore, let Art always remind us of them; therefore let us always have men ready to give the loving pains of a life to the faithful representing of commonplace things—men who see beauty in these commonplace things, and delight in showing how kindly the light of heaven falls on them.
I can’t afford to give all my love and reverence to such rarities: I want a great deal of those feelings for my every-day fellow-men, especially for the few in the foreground of the great multitude, whose faces I know, whose hands I touch, for whom I have to make way with kindly courtesy.
Neither are picturesque lazzaroni or romantic criminals half so frequent as your common labourer, who gets his own bread and eats it vulgarly but creditably with his own pocket-knife.
It is more needful that I should have a fibre of sympathy connecting me with that vulgar citizen who weighs out my sugar in a vilely assorted cravat and waistcoat, than with the handsomest rascal in red scarf and green feathers—more needful that my heart should swell with loving admiration at some trait of gentle goodness in the faulty people who sit at the same hearth with me, or in the clergyman of my own parish, who is perhaps rather too corpulent and in other respects is not an Oberlin or a Tillotson, than at the deeds of heroes whom I shall never know except by hearsay, or at the sublimest abstract of all clerical graces that was ever conceived by an able novelist.
But I am not sure of that; at least I know that the people in Broxton and Hayslope would have been very sorry to part with their clergyman, and that most faces brightened at his approach; and until it can be proved that hatred is a better thing for the soul than love, I must believe that Mr. Irwine’s influence in his parish was a more wholesome one than that of the zealous Mr. Ryde, who came there twenty years afterwards, when Mr. Irwine had been gathered to his fathers.
It’s the same with the notions in religion as it is with math’matics—a man may be able to work problems straight off in’s head as he sits by the fire and smokes his pipe, but if he has to make a machine or a building, he must have a will and a resolution and love something else better than his own ease.
And he made folks love him and respect him, and that was better nor stirring up their gall wi’ being overbusy.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I have often been favoured with the confidence of these select natures, and find them to concur in the experience that great men are overestimated and small men are insupportable; that if you would love a woman without ever looking back on your love as a folly, she must die while you are courting her; and if you would maintain the slightest belief in human heroism, you must never make a pilgrimage to see the hero.
For I have observed this remarkable coincidence, that the select natures who pant after the ideal, and find nothing in pantaloons or petticoats great enough to command their reverence and love, are curiously in unison with the narrowest and pettiest.
So she turned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house door, followed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she trod on.
It’s well seen what choice the most of ’em know how to make, by the poor draggle-tails o’ wives you see, like bits o’ gauze ribbin, good for nothing when the colour’s gone.” “Well, well, thee canstna say but what I knowed how to make a choice when I married thee,” said Mr. Poyser, who usually settled little conjugal disputes by a compliment of this sort; “and thee wast twice as buxom as Dinah ten year ago.” “I niver said as a woman had need to be ugly to make a good missis of a house.
She provoked me past bearing sometimes; and, as I told her, she went clean again’ the Scriptur’, for that says, ‘Love your neighbour as yourself’; ‘but,’ I said, ‘if you loved your neighbour no better nor you do yourself, Dinah, it’s little enough you’d do for him.
Sitting by that sick woman, I daresay, as she’d set her heart on going to all of a sudden.” “Ah, it was a pity she should take such megrims into her head, when she might ha’ stayed wi’ us all summer, and eaten twice as much as she wanted, and it ’ud niver ha’ been missed.
If Hetty gets married, theed’st like to ha’ Dinah wi’ thee constant.” “It’s no use thinking o’ that,” said Mrs. Poyser.
But you see Adam, as has got one o’ the best head-pieces hereabout, knows better; he’s a good Churchman, else I’d never encourage him for a sweetheart for Hetty.” “Why, goodness me,” said Mrs. Poyser, who had looked back while her husband was speaking, “look where Molly is with them lads!
But they knew a few “good words” by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved silently, following the service without any very clear comprehension indeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and bring blessing.
Melodies die out, like the pipe of Pan, with the ears that love them and listen for them.
When she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat so, she dared not look up.
Where that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery even to his most intimate acquaintances.
It was poor Lisbeth’s blind way of feeling that human love and pity are a ground of faith in some other love.
“It’s a sore fault in me as I’m so hot and out o’ patience with people when they do wrong, and my heart gets shut up against ’em, so as I can’t bring myself to forgive ’em.
I see clear enough there’s more pride nor love in my soul, for I could sooner make a thousand strokes with th’ hammer for my father than bring myself to say a kind word to him.
“Well, Mrs. Bede,” said Mrs. Poyser, as they walked on together, “you must keep up your heart; husbands and wives must be content when they’ve lived to rear their children and see one another’s hair grey.” “Aye, aye,” said Mr. Poyser; “they wonna have long to wait for one another then, anyhow.
Yet in her secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would perhaps learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church.
She had a sickening sense that no lot could ever be pleasant to her again if her Thursday night’s vision was not to be fulfilled; and in this moment of chill, bare, wintry disappointment and doubt, she looked towards the possibility of being with Arthur again, of meeting his loving glance, and hearing his soft words with that eager yearning which one may call the “growing pain” of passion.
It was summer morning in his heart, and he saw Hetty in the sunshine—a sunshine without glare, with slanting rays that tremble between the delicate shadows of the leaves.
We look at the one little woman’s face we love as we look at the face of our mother earth, and see all sorts of answers to our own yearnings.
It was impossible for Adam not to feel that what had happened in the last week had brought the prospect of marriage nearer to him.
Hitherto he had felt keenly the danger that some other man might step in and get possession of Hetty’s heart and hand, while he himself was still in a position that made him shrink from asking her to accept him.
To be sure, if she loved him very much, she would be content to wait for him: but _did_ she love him?
But now he could not help saying to himself that the heaviest part of his burden was removed, and that even before the end of another year his circumstances might be brought into a shape that would allow him to think of marrying.
It would never do, he feared, for his mother to live in the same house with him when he was married; and yet how hard she would think it if he asked her to leave him!
For himself, he would have liked that they should all live together till Seth was married, and they might have built a bit themselves to the old house, and made more room.
He had long made up his mind that it would be wrong as well as foolish for him to marry a blooming young girl, so long as he had no other prospect than that of growing poverty with a growing family.
The sound of tools to a clever workman who loves his work is like the tentative sounds of the orchestra to the violinist who has to bear his part in the overture: the strong fibres begin their accustomed thrill, and what was a moment before joy, vexation, or ambition, begins its change into energy.
Perhaps, if you had not been already in the secret, you might not have guessed what sad memories, what warm affection, what tender fluttering hopes, had their home in this athletic body with the broken finger-nails—in this rough man, who knew no better lyrics than he could find in the Old and New Version and an occasional hymn; who knew the smallest possible amount of profane history; and for whom the motion and shape of the earth, the course of the sun, and the changes of the seasons lay in the region of mystery just made visible by fragmentary knowledge.
Of course, the secret of her objection to the best clothes was her suspicion that they were put on for Hetty’s sake; but deeper than all her peevishness lay the need that her son should love her.
An’ thee sha’t put on thy Sunday cloose when thee lik’st for me—I’ll ne’er plague thee no moor about’n.” “Well, well; good-bye, mother,” said Adam, kissing her and hurrying away.
I war gone thirty, an’ th’ feyther too, afore we war married; an’ young enough too.
Run in this minute—there’s a good little girl.” He lifted her up in his strong arms and kissed her as he spoke, a ceremony which Totty regarded as a tiresome interruption to cherry-eating; and when he set her down she trotted off quite silently towards the house, sucking her cherries as she went along.
That blush made his heart beat with a new happiness.
“I frightened you,” he said, with a delicious sense that it didn’t signify what he said, since Hetty seemed to feel as much as he did; “let _me_ pick the currants up.” That was soon done, for they had only fallen in a tangled mass on the grass-plot, and Adam, as he rose and gave her the basin again, looked straight into her eyes with the subdued tenderness that belongs to the first moments of hopeful love.
Adam’s heart was too full to speak, and he thought Hetty knew all that was in it.
She was not indifferent to his presence after all; she had blushed when she saw him, and then there was that touch of sadness about her which must surely mean love, since it was the opposite of her usual manner, which had often impressed him as indifference.
And he could glance at her continually as she bent over the fruit, while the level evening sunbeams stole through the thick apple-tree boughs, and rested on her round cheek and neck as if they too were in love with her.
It was to Adam the time that a man can least forget in after-life, the time when he believes that the first woman he has ever loved betrays by a slight something—a word, a tone, a glance, the quivering of a lip or an eyelid—that she is at least beginning to love him in return.
But the first glad moment in our first love is a vision which returns to us to the last, and brings with it a thrill of feeling intense and special as the recurrent sensation of a sweet odour breathed in a far-off hour of happiness.
Like many other men, he thought the signs of love for another were signs of love towards himself.
She wanted to be treated lovingly—oh, it was very hard to bear this blank of absence, silence, apparent indifference, after those moments of glowing love!
She was not afraid that Adam would tease her with love-making and flattering speeches like her other admirers; he had always been so reserved to her; she could enjoy without any fear the sense that this strong brave man loved her and was near her.
Hetty, we know, was not the first woman that had behaved more gently to the man who loved her in vain because she had herself begun to love another.
Hetty’s love of finery was just the thing that would most provoke his mother, and he himself disliked it as much as it was possible for him to dislike anything that belonged to her.
For the world he would not have spoken of his love to Hetty yet, till this commencing kindness towards him should have grown into unmistakable love.
But whativer did you let her run away from you along wi’ Tommy for, and stuff herself wi’ fruit as she can’t eat a bit o’ good victual?” This was said in a lower tone than usual, while her husband was talking to Adam; for Mrs. Poyser was strict in adherence to her own rules of propriety, and she considered that a young girl was not to be treated sharply in the presence of a respectable man who was courting her.
It little becomes anybody i’ this house to make fun o’ my sister’s child, an’ her just gone away from us, as it went to my heart to part wi’ her.
For she’s one o’ them things as looks the brightest on a rainy day, and loves you the best when you’re most i’ need on’t.” Mrs. Poyser, you perceive, was aware that nothing would be so likely to expel the comic as the terrible.
It was a sort of scene which Adam had beheld almost weekly for years; he knew by heart every arabesque flourish in the framed specimen of Bartle Massey’s handwriting which hung over the schoolmaster’s head, by way of keeping a lofty ideal before the minds of his pupils; he knew the backs of all the books on the shelf running along the whitewashed wall above the pegs for the slates; he knew exactly how many grains were gone out of the ear of Indian corn that hung from one of the rafters; he had long ago exhausted the resources of his imagination in trying to think how the bunch of leathery seaweed had looked and grown in its native element; and from the place where he sat, he could make nothing of the old map of England that hung against the opposite wall, for age had turned it of a fine yellow brown, something like that of a well-seasoned meerschaum.
You may say to yourselves, ‘I’m one fool, and Jack’s another; if my fool’s head weighed four pound, and Jack’s three pound three ounces and three quarters, how many pennyweights heavier would my head be than Jack’s?’ A man that had got his heart in learning figures would make sums for himself and work ’em in his head.
Adam was used to hear him talk in this way, but had never learned so much of Bartle’s past life as to know whether his view of married comfort was founded on experience.
Bartle kept his eye on the moving figure till it passed into the darkness, while Vixen, in a state of divided affection, had twice run back to the house to bestow a parenthetic lick on her puppies.
But Hetty had another passion, only a little less strong than her love of finery, and that other passion made her like to wear the locket even hidden in her bosom.
To be sure, Captain Donnithorne loved her so that he would never care about looking at other people, but then those other people didn’t know how he loved her, and she was not satisfied to appear shabby and insignificant in their eyes even for a short space.
It was the band of the Benefit Club, which had mustered in all its glory—that is to say, in bright-blue scarfs and blue favours, and carrying its banner with the motto, “Let brotherly love continue,” encircling a picture of a stone-pit.
I believe if I were to break my neck, he would feel it the greatest misfortune that could befall him, and yet it seems a pleasure to him to make my life a series of petty annoyances.” “Ah, my boy, it is not only woman’s love that is ἀπέρωτος ἒρως as old Æschylus calls it.
There’s plenty of ‘unloving love’ in the world of a masculine kind.
Gone a little too far, perhaps, in flirtation, but another man in his place would have acted much worse; and no harm would come—no harm _should_ come, for the next time he was alone with Hetty, he would explain to her that she must not think seriously of him or of what had passed.
I know you have all reason to love him, but no one of his parishioners has so much reason as I.
But I am not speaking to you about a stranger; some of you are his intimate friends, and I believe there is not one here who does not know enough of him to join heartily in drinking his health.” As Mr. Irwine paused, Arthur jumped up and, filling his glass, said, “A bumper to Adam Bede, and may he live to have sons as faithful and clever as himself!” No hearer, not even Bartle Massey, was so delighted with this toast as Mr. Poyser.
The foolish child felt her heart swelling with discontent; for what woman was ever satisfied with apparent neglect, even when she knows it to be the mask of love?

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“Upon my word it’s a pretty sight,” said the old lady, in her deep voice, when she was seated, and looked round on the bright scene with its dark-green background; “and it’s the last fête-day I’m likely to see, unless you make haste and get married, Arthur.
Poor Seth has looked rather down-hearted of late; I thought it was because of his father’s dying in that sad way, but Joshua Rann tells me he wanted to marry that sweet little Methodist preacher who was here about a month ago, and I suppose she refused him.” “Ah, I remember hearing about her.
I daresay, now, she’ll marry a man who would have thought her just as pretty if she had had round eyes and red hair.” Arthur dared not turn his eyes towards Hetty while Mrs. Irwine was speaking of her.
The man may be no better able than the dog to explain the influence the more refined beauty has on him, but he feels it.” “Bless me, Dauphin, what does an old bachelor like you know about it?” “Oh, that is one of the matters in which old bachelors are wiser than married men, because they have time for more general contemplation.
Any one who could have looked into poor Bessy’s heart would have seen a striking resemblance between her little hopes and anxieties and Hetty’s.
You would have been inclined to box Bessy’s ears, and you would have longed to kiss Hetty.
“Couldn’t you find something else for this girl, and save that grim-looking gown for one of the older women?” “I have bought nothing but what is useful and substantial,” said Miss Lydia, adjusting her own lace; “I should not think of encouraging a love of finery in young women of that class.
That simple dancing of well-covered matrons, laying aside for an hour the cares of house and dairy, remembering but not affecting youth, not jealous but proud of the young maidens by their side—that holiday sprightliness of portly husbands paying little compliments to their wives, as if their courting days were come again—those lads and lasses a little confused and awkward with their partners, having nothing to say—it would be a pleasant variety to see all that sometimes, instead of low dresses and large skirts, and scanning glances exploring costumes, and languid men in lacquered boots smiling with double meaning.
How Hetty’s heart beat as Arthur approached her!
There are faces which nature charges with a meaning and pathos not belonging to the single human soul that flutters beneath them, but speaking the joys and sorrows of foregone generations—eyes that tell of deep love which doubtless has been and is somewhere, but not paired with these eyes—perhaps paired with pale eyes that can say nothing; just as a national language may be instinct with poetry unfelt by the lips that use it.
That look of Hetty’s oppressed Arthur with a dread which yet had something of a terrible unconfessed delight in it, that she loved him too well.
“Now, sit down in this comfortable chair, and here is Mills ready to give you what you would like best.” He hurried away to seek another matronly partner, for due honour must be paid to the married women before he asked any of the young ones; and the country-dances, and the stamping, and the gracious nodding, and the waving of the hands, went on joyously.
At last the time had come for the fourth dance—longed for by the strong, grave Adam, as if he had been a delicate-handed youth of eighteen; for we are all very much alike when we are in our first love; and Adam had hardly ever touched Hetty’s hand for more than a transient greeting—had never danced with her but once before.
His eyes had followed her eagerly to-night in spite of himself, and had taken in deeper draughts of love.
He thought she behaved so prettily, so quietly; she did not seem to be flirting at all, she smiled less than usual; there was almost a sweet sadness about her.
“God bless her!” he said inwardly; “I’d make her life a happy ’un, if a strong arm to work for her, and a heart to love her, could do it.” And then there stole over him delicious thoughts of coming home from work, and drawing Hetty to his side, and feeling her cheek softly pressed against his, till he forgot where he was, and the music and the tread of feet might have been the falling of rain and the roaring of the wind, for what he knew.
She took it with an air of indifference and put it in her pocket, in her heart vexed and angry with Adam because he had seen it, but determined now that she would show no more signs of agitation.
Had Hetty a lover he didn’t know of?
For none of her relations, he was sure, would give her a locket like that; and none of her admirers, with whom he was acquainted, was in the position of an accepted lover, as the giver of that locket must be.
He could only feel with a terrible pang that there was something in Hetty’s life unknown to him; that while he had been rocking himself in the hope that she would come to love him, she was already loving another.
Perhaps Hetty had had as much as that in Christmas boxes, and there was no knowing but she might have been childish enough to spend it in that way; she was such a young thing, and she couldn’t help loving finery!
How could Hetty have an accepted lover, quite unknown to him?
It would be folly to believe that the locket was given to her by a lover.
From this last trouble the Broxton and Hayslope farmers, on their pleasant uplands and in their brook-watered valleys, had not suffered, and as I cannot pretend that they were such exceptional farmers as to love the general good better than their own, you will infer that they were not in very low spirits about the rapid rise in the price of bread, so long as there was hope of gathering in their own corn undamaged; and occasional days of sunshine and drying winds flattered this hope.
For there is no hour that has not its births of gladness and despair, no morning brightness that does not bring new sickness to desolation as well as new forces to genius and love.
To “make a good job” of anything, however small, was always a pleasure to Adam, and he sat on a block, with his book resting on a planing-table, whistling low every now and then and turning his head on one side with a just perceptible smile of gratification—of pride, too, for if Adam loved a bit of good work, he loved also to think, “I did it!” And I believe the only people who are free from that weakness are those who have no work to call their own.
A nature like Adam’s, with a great need of love and reverence in it, depends for so much of its happiness on what it can believe and feel about others!
And he had no ideal world of dead heroes; he knew little of the life of men in the past; he must find the beings to whom he could cling with loving admiration among those who came within speech of him.
The two figures were standing opposite to each other, with clasped hands about to part; and while they were bending to kiss, Gyp, who had been running among the brushwood, came out, caught sight of them, and gave a sharp bark.
So I took care of her to the gate, and asked for a kiss for my pains.
Susceptible persons are more affected by a change of tone than by unexpected words, and Arthur had the susceptibility of a nature at once affectionate and vain.
This is not the first time you’ve met Hetty Sorrel in this grove, and this is not the first time you’ve kissed her.” Arthur felt a startled uncertainty how far Adam was speaking from knowledge, and how far from mere inference.
You know as well as I do what it’s to lead to when a gentleman like you kisses and makes love to a young woman like Hetty, and gives her presents as she’s frightened for other folks to see.
And I say it again, you’re acting the part of a selfish light-minded scoundrel though it cuts me to th’ heart to say so, and I’d rather ha’ lost my right hand.” “Let me tell you, Adam,” said Arthur, bridling his growing anger and trying to recur to his careless tone, “you’re not only devilishly impertinent, but you’re talking nonsense.
Every man likes to flirt with a pretty girl, and every pretty girl likes to be flirted with.
The wider the distance between them, the less harm there is, for then she’s not likely to deceive herself.” “I don’t know what you mean by flirting,” said Adam, “but if you mean behaving to a woman as if you loved her, and yet not loving her all the while, I say that’s not th’ action of an honest man, and what isn’t honest does come t’ harm.
What if you meant nothing by your kissing and your presents?
I tell you as you’ve filled her mind so with the thought of you as it’ll mayhap poison her life, and she’ll never love another man as ’ud make her a good husband.” Arthur had felt a sudden relief while Adam was speaking; he perceived that Adam had no positive knowledge of the past, and that there was no irrevocable damage done by this evening’s unfortunate rencontre.
Perhaps I’ve gone a little too far in taking notice of the pretty little thing and stealing a kiss now and then.
“No, it’ll not be soon forgot, as you’ve come in between her and me, when she might ha’ loved me—it’ll not soon be forgot as you’ve robbed me o’ my happiness, while I thought you was my best friend, and a noble-minded man, as I was proud to work for.
And you’ve been kissing her, and meaning nothing, have you?
And I never kissed her i’ my life—but I’d ha’ worked hard for years for the right to kiss her.
Arthur’s lips were now as pale as Adam’s; his heart was beating violently.
The discovery that Adam loved Hetty was a shock which made him for the moment see himself in the light of Adam’s indignation, and regard Adam’s suffering as not merely a consequence, but an element of his error.
“I didn’t know you loved her.” “But you’ve made her love _you_,” said Adam.
The intense joy that flooded his soul brought back some of the old affection with it.
“And perhaps I judged you too harsh—I’m apt to be harsh—and you may have acted out o’ thoughtlessness more than I should ha’ believed was possible for a man with a heart and a conscience.
I’ve told you already that you think too seriously of a little flirtation.
I’m none o’ them men as can go making love first to one woman and then t’ another, and don’t think it much odds which of ’em I take.
What I feel for Hetty’s a different sort o’ love, such as I believe nobody can know much about but them as feel it and God as has given it to ’em.
And if it’s true what you’ve been saying all along—and if it’s only been trifling and flirting as you call it, as ’ll be put an end to by your going away—why, then, I’d wait, and hope her heart ’ud turn to me after all.
I know she’s been fixing her heart on you, for there’s a many things clear to me now as I didn’t understand before.
“Well, then, if you feel it,” Adam rejoined, eagerly; “if you feel as you may ha’ put false notions into her mind, and made her believe as you loved her, when all the while you meant nothing, I’ve this demand to make of you—I’m not speaking for myself, but for her.
Arthur’s, as you know, was a loving nature.
But Adam could receive no amends; his suffering could not be cancelled; his respect and affection could not be recovered by any prompt deeds of atonement.
He had found out the dream in which she was living—that she was to be a lady in silks and satins—and when he had first talked to her about his going away, she had asked him tremblingly to let her go with him and be married.
He loved her the better because she knew nothing of his secrets.
Hetty knew that their meeting yesterday must be the last before Arthur went away—there was no possibility of their contriving another without exciting suspicion—and she was like a frightened child, unable to think of anything, only able to cry at the mention of parting, and then put her face up to have the tears kissed away.
Her heart might really turn to Adam, as he said, after a while; and in that case there would have been no great harm done, since it was still Adam’s ardent wish to make her his wife.
He must have seen them kissing, she knew, but she had no conception of the scene that had taken place between Arthur and Adam.
Besides, she _must_ go on seeming to encourage Adam, lest her uncle and aunt should be angry and suspect her of having some secret lover.
And when they rejoined her aunt and uncle, she could pursue her thoughts without interruption, for Mr. Poyser held that though a young man might like to have the woman he was courting on his arm, he would nevertheless be glad of a little reasonable talk about business the while; and, for his own part, he was curious to hear the most recent news about the Chase Farm.
She clung to the comforting hopeful words Arthur had uttered in their last meeting—“I shall come again at Christmas, and then we will see what can be done.” She clung to the belief that he was so fond of her, he would never be happy without her; and she still hugged her secret—that a great gentleman loved her—with gratified pride, as a superiority over all the girls she knew.
If you was being courted by any man as ’ud make you his wife, and I’d known you was fond of him and meant to have him, I should have no right to speak a word to you about it; but when I see you’re being made love to by a gentleman as can never marry you, and doesna think o’ marrying you, I feel bound t’ interfere for you.
And besides that, you’ll have to suffer in your feelings, wi’ giving your love to a man as can never marry you, so as he might take care of you all your life.” Adam paused and looked at Hetty, who was plucking the leaves from the filbert-trees and tearing them up in her hand.
“You’ve no right to say as I love him,” she said, faintly, but impetuously, plucking another rough leaf and tearing it up.
Adam’s heart yearned over her as he looked at her.
“I doubt it must be so, Hetty,” he said, tenderly; “for I canna believe you’d let any man kiss you by yourselves, and give you a gold box with his hair, and go a-walking i’ the Grove to meet him, if you didna love him.
It’s him I blame for stealing your love i’ that way, when he knew he could never make you the right amends.
He told me himself he meant nothing by his kissing and presents, and he wanted to make me believe as you thought light of ’em too.
I can’t help thinking as you’ve been trusting to his loving you well enough to marry you, for all he’s a gentleman.
It’s never entered his head the thought o’ marrying you.” “How do you know?
“Perhaps you can’t believe me, Hetty, because you think too well of him—because you think he loves you better than he does.
It wouldna ha’ been good for you if he’d wanted to do such a mad thing as marry you: it ’ud ha’ led to no happiness i’ th’ end.” Hetty said nothing; she felt a revival of hope at the mention of a letter which Adam had not read.
“Bless your sweet face, my pet,” she said, the mother’s strong love filling her keen eyes with mildness, as Totty leaned forward and put out her arms.
But he must go at last, and all he could do was to press her hand gently as he said “Good-bye,” and hope she would take that as a sign that if his love could ever be a refuge for her, it was there the same as ever.
But if Aristides the Just was ever in love and jealous, he was at that moment not perfectly magnanimous.
And I cannot pretend that Adam, in these painful days, felt nothing but righteous indignation and loving pity.
He was bitterly jealous, and in proportion as his love made him indulgent in his judgment of Hetty, the bitterness found a vent in his feeling towards Arthur.
“I’m a roughish fellow, altogether; I don’t know, now I come to think on’t, what there is much for a woman to like about me; and yet I might ha’ got another wife easy enough, if I hadn’t set my heart on her.
But it’s little matter what other women think about me, if she can’t love me.
She might ha’ loved me, perhaps, as likely as any other man—there’s nobody hereabouts as I’m afraid of, if _he_ hadn’t come between us; but now I shall belike be hateful to her because I’m so different to him.
There’s many a good bit o’ work done with a bad heart.
Adam was not inclined to enter into the subtleties of religious experience, but he was inclined to interchange a word or two of brotherly affection and confidence with Seth.
That was a rare impulse in him, much as the brothers loved each other.
The honour and love you bear him is nothing but meet, for God has given him great gifts, and he uses them as the patriarch Joseph did, who, when he was exalted to a place of power and trust, yet yearned with tenderness towards his parent and his younger brother.
“My heart is knit to your aged mother since it was granted me to be near her in the day of trouble.
For I feel it, I feel it—infinite love is suffering too—yea, in the fulness of knowledge it suffers, it yearns, it mourns; and that is a blind self-seeking which wants to be freed from the sorrow wherewith the whole creation groaneth and travaileth.
Surely it is not true blessedness to be free from sorrow, while there is sorrow and sin in the world: sorrow is then a part of love, and love does not seek to throw it off.
And is He not one with the Infinite Love itself—as our love is one with our sorrow?
“These thoughts have been much borne in on me of late, and I have seen with new clearness the meaning of those words, ‘If any man love me, let him take up my cross.’ I have heard this enlarged on as if it meant the troubles and persecutions we bring on ourselves by confessing Jesus.
My heart cleaves to her and her children as the nearest of all to me in the flesh—yea, and to all in that house.
Greet your mother for me with a kiss.
She asked me to kiss her twice when we parted.” Adam had refolded the letter, and was sitting meditatively with his head resting on his arm at the head of the bed, when Seth came upstairs.
A woman may get to love by degrees—the best fire dosna flare up the soonest.
But her heart began to flutter strangely, and her hands to tremble as she broke the seal.
“DEAREST HETTY—I have spoken truly when I have said that I loved you, and I shall never forget our love.
If I say anything to pain you in this letter, do not believe it is for want of love and tenderness towards you, for there is nothing I would not do for you, if I knew it to be really for your happiness.
I cannot bear to think of my little Hetty shedding tears when I am not there to kiss them away; and if I followed only my own inclinations, I should be with her at this moment instead of writing.
“Dear, dear Hetty, sweet as our love has been to me, sweet as it would be to me for you to love me always, I feel that it would have been better for us both if we had never had that happiness, and that it is my duty to ask you to love me and care for me as little as you can.
The fault has all been mine, for though I have been unable to resist the longing to be near you, I have felt all the while that your affection for me might cause you grief.
And I feel it would be a great evil for you if your affections continued so fixed on me that you could think of no other man who might be able to make you happier by his love than I ever can, and if you continued to look towards something in the future which cannot possibly happen.
I know you can never be happy except by marrying a man in your own station; and if I were to marry you now, I should only be adding to any wrong I have done, besides offending against my duty in the other relations of life.
“And since I cannot marry you, we must part—we must try not to feel like lovers any more.
Forgive me, and try to forget everything about me, except that I shall be, as long as I live, your affectionate friend, “ARTHUR DONNITHORNE.” Slowly Hetty had read this letter; and when she looked up from it there was the reflection of a blanched face in the old dim glass—a white marble face with rounded childish forms, but with something sadder than a child’s pain in it.
She felt nothing but that Arthur was cruel—cruel to write so, cruel not to marry her.
Reasons why he could not marry her had no existence for her mind; how could she believe in any misery that could come to her from the fulfilment of all she had been longing for and dreaming of?
She hated the writer of that letter—hated him for the very reason that she hung upon him with all her love—all the girlish passion and vanity that made up her love.
Of Dinah’s affectionate entreaty to think of her as a friend in trouble?
Any affection or comfort Dinah could have given her would have been as indifferent to Hetty this morning as everything else was except her bruised passion.
I’d hard work t’ hould _her_ in, an’ she married i’ spite o’ me—a feller wi’ on’y two head o’ stock when there should ha’ been ten on’s farm—she might well die o’ th’ inflammation afore she war thirty.” It was seldom the old man made so long a speech, but his son’s question had fallen like a bit of dry fuel on the embers of a long unextinguished resentment, which had always made the grandfather more indifferent to Hetty than to his son’s children.
I’ll never gi’ my consent to her going for a lady’s maid, while she’s got good friends to take care on her till she’s married to somebody better nor one o’ them valets, as is neither a common man nor a gentleman, an’ must live on the fat o’ the land, an’s like enough to stick his hands under his coat-tails and expect his wife to work for him.” “Aye, aye,” said Mr. Poyser, “we must have a better husband for her nor that, and there’s better at hand.
An’ here I’m having linen spun, an’ thinking all the while it’ll make sheeting and table-clothing for her when she’s married, an’ she’ll live i’ the parish wi’ us, and never go out of our sights—like a fool as I am for thinking aught about her, as is no better nor a cherry wi’ a hard stone inside it.” “Nay, nay, thee mustna make much of a trifle,” said Mr. Poyser, soothingly.
She knew quite well whom he had in his mind in his allusions to marriage, and to a sober, solid husband; and when she was in her bedroom again, the possibility of her marrying Adam presented itself to her in a new light.
Why should she not marry Adam?
She felt confident that he would still want to marry her, and any further thought about Adam’s happiness in the matter had never yet visited her.
Why, I say you may do as you like about giving up any o’ your corn-land afore your lease is up, which it won’t be for a year come next Michaelmas, but I’ll not consent to take more dairy work into my hands, either for love or money; and there’s nayther love nor money here, as I can see, on’y other folks’s love o’ theirselves, and the money as is to go into other folks’s pockets.
“Bethell will do that regularly with the cart and pony.” “Oh, sir, begging your pardon, I’ve never been used t’ having gentlefolks’s servants coming about my back places, a-making love to both the gells at once and keeping ’em with their hands on their hips listening to all manner o’ gossip when they should be down on their knees a-scouring.
It’s only women who have a right to live as long as that.” “When they’ve got old-bachelor sons who would be forlorn without them,” said Mr. Irwine, laughing, and kissing his mother’s hand.
It must be, after all, that she had set her heart on Adam at last, and her sudden freak of wanting to be a lady’s maid must have been caused by some little pique or misunderstanding between them, which had passed by.
She was not in the house-place when he entered, and he sat talking to Mr. and Mrs. Poyser for a few minutes with a heavy fear on his heart that they might presently tell him Hetty was ill.
Thank God for that.” As the weeks went by, and he saw her always looking pleased to see him—turning up her lovely face towards him as if she meant him to understand that she was glad for him to come—and going about her work in the same equable way, making no sign of sorrow, he began to believe that her feeling towards Arthur must have been much slighter than he had imagined in his first indignation and alarm, and that she had been able to think of her girlish fancy that Arthur was in love with her and would marry her as a folly of which she was timely cured.
And it perhaps was, as he had sometimes in his more cheerful moments hoped it would be—her heart was really turning with all the more warmth towards the man she knew to have a serious love for her.
Possibly you think that Adam was not at all sagacious in his interpretations, and that it was altogether extremely unbecoming in a sensible man to behave as he did—falling in love with a girl who really had nothing more than her beauty to recommend her, attributing imaginary virtues to her, and even condescending to cleave to her after she had fallen in love with another man, waiting for her kind looks as a patient trembling dog waits for his master’s eye to be turned upon him.
Of course, I know that, as a rule, sensible men fall in love with the most sensible women of their acquaintance, see through all the pretty deceits of coquettish beauty, never imagine themselves loved when they are not loved, cease loving on all proper occasions, and marry the woman most fitted for them in every respect—indeed, so as to compel the approbation of all the maiden ladies in their neighbourhood.
For my own part, however, I respect him none the less—nay, I think the deep love he had for that sweet, rounded, blossom-like, dark-eyed Hetty, of whose inward self he was really very ignorant, came out of the very strength of his nature and not out of any inconsistent weakness.
To feel its wondrous harmonies searching the subtlest windings of your soul, the delicate fibres of life where no memory can penetrate, and binding together your whole being past and present in one unspeakable vibration, melting you in one moment with all the tenderness, all the love that has been scattered through the toilsome years, concentrating in one emotion of heroic courage or resignation all the hard-learnt lessons of self-renouncing sympathy, blending your present joy with past sorrow and your present sorrow with all your past joy?
It is more than a woman’s love that moves us in a woman’s eyes—it seems to be a far-off mighty love that has come near to us, and made speech for itself there; the rounded neck, the dimpled arm, move us by something more than their prettiness—by their close kinship with all we have known of tenderness and peace.
Our good Adam had no fine words into which he could put his feeling for Hetty: he could not disguise mystery in this way with the appearance of knowledge; he called his love frankly a mystery, as you have heard him.
He only knew that the sight and memory of her moved him deeply, touching the spring of all love and tenderness, all faith and courage within him.
Surely his attentions to Hetty must have been of a slight kind; they were altogether wrong, and such as no man in Arthur’s position ought to have allowed himself, but they must have had an air of playfulness about them, which had probably blinded him to their danger and had prevented them from laying any strong hold on Hetty’s heart.
Adam’s enthusiasm lay in these things; and our love is inwrought in our enthusiasm as electricity is inwrought in the air, exalting its power by a subtle presence.
Adam would be able to take a separate house now, and provide for his mother in the old one; his prospects would justify his marrying very soon, and if Dinah consented to have Seth, their mother would perhaps be more contented to live apart from Adam.
But Tommy must have the start up to the next stile, because he’s the smallest.” Adam had never behaved so much like a determined lover before.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Her heart beat no faster, and she looked at the half-bare hedgerows and the ploughed field with the same sense of oppressive dulness as before.
The calm patience with which he had once waited for Hetty’s love, content only with her presence and the thought of the future, had forsaken him since that terrible shock nearly three months ago.
But though he might not speak to Hetty of his love, he would tell her about his new prospects and see if she would be pleased.
Hetty thought he was going to marry Mary Burge—she didn’t like him to marry—perhaps she didn’t like him to marry any one but herself?
He leaned towards her and took her hand, as he said: “I could afford to be married now, Hetty—I could make a wife comfortable; but I shall never want to be married if you won’t have me.” Hetty looked up at him and smiled through her tears, as she had done to Arthur that first evening in the wood, when she had thought he was not coming, and yet he came.
His right hand held her left, and he pressed her arm close against his heart as he leaned down towards her.
“Do you really love me, Hetty?
Will you be my own wife, to love and take care of as long as I live?” Hetty did not speak, but Adam’s face was very close to hers, and she put up her round cheek against his, like a kitten.
“It ud be a poor tale if I hadna feathers and linen,” she said, hoarsely, “when I never sell a fowl but what’s plucked, and the wheel’s a-going every day o’ the week.” “Come, my wench,” said Mr. Poyser, when Hetty came down, “come and kiss us, and let us wish you luck.” Hetty went very quietly and kissed the big good-natured man.
“There!” he said, patting her on the back, “go and kiss your aunt and your grandfather.
Come, come, now,” he went on, becoming jocose, as soon as Hetty had kissed her aunt and the old man, “Adam wants a kiss too, I’ll warrant, and he’s a right to one now.” Hetty turned away, smiling, towards her empty chair.
“Come, Adam, then, take one,” persisted Mr. Poyser, “else y’ arena half a man.” Adam got up, blushing like a small maiden—great strong fellow as he was—and, putting his arm round Hetty stooped down and gently kissed her lips.
Even Hetty felt something like contentment in the midst of all this love.
Adam’s attachment to her, Adam’s caress, stirred no passion in her, were no longer enough to satisfy her vanity, but they were the best her life offered her now—they promised her some change.
You canna think o’ getting married afore Easter.
I’m not for long courtships, but there must be a bit o’ time to make things comfortable.” “Aye, to be sure,” said Mrs. Poyser, in a hoarse whisper; “Christian folks can’t be married like cuckoos, I reckon.” “I’m a bit daunted, though,” said Mr. Poyser, “when I think as we may have notice to quit, and belike be forced to take a farm twenty mile off.” “Eh,” said the old man, staring at the floor and lifting his hands up and down, while his arms rested on the elbows of his chair, “it’s a poor tale if I mun leave th’ ould spot an be buried in a strange parish.
But a happy time, nevertheless, for it was taking him nearer and nearer to March, when they were to be married, and all the little preparations for their new housekeeping marked the progress towards the longed-for day.
Lisbeth had cried so piteously at the thought of leaving Adam that he had gone to Hetty and asked her if, for the love of him, she would put up with his mother’s ways and consent to live with her.
So Adam was consoled for the disappointment he had felt when Seth had come back from his visit to Snowfield and said “it was no use—Dinah’s heart wasna turned towards marrying.” For when he told his mother that Hetty was willing they should all live together and there was no more need of them to think of parting, she said, in a more contented tone than he had heard her speak in since it had been settled that he was to be married, “Eh, my lad, I’ll be as still as th’ ould tabby, an’ ne’er want to do aught but th’ offal work, as _she_ wonna like t’ do.
He would not know that hidden behind the apple-blossoms, or among the golden corn, or under the shrouding boughs of the wood, there might be a human heart beating heavily with anguish—perhaps a young blooming girl, not knowing where to turn for refuge from swift-advancing shame, understanding no more of this life of ours than a foolish lost lamb wandering farther and farther in the nightfall on the lonely heath, yet tasting the bitterest of life’s bitterness.
But now necessity was pressing hard upon her—now the time of her marriage was close at hand—she could no longer rest in this blind trust.
She had had a letter from Dinah lately, full of kind words about the coming marriage, which she had heard of from Seth; and when Hetty had read this letter aloud to her uncle, he had said, “I wish Dinah ’ud come again now, for she’d be a comfort to your aunt when you’re gone.
Hetty felt a sense of protection in his presence—she was used to it now: if she could have had the past undone and known no other love than her quiet liking for Adam!
“God bless her for loving me,” said Adam, as he went on his way to work again, with Gyp at his heels.
Book Fifth Chapter XXXVI The Journey of Hope A long, lonely journey, with sadness in the heart; away from the familiar to the strange: that is a hard and dreary thing even to the rich, the strong, the instructed; a hard thing, even when we are called by duty, not urged by dread.
“Why, the sweetheart as you’ve left behind, or else him as you’re goin’ arter—which is it?” Hetty felt her face flushing and then turning pale.
Such a pretty lass as you can get a sweetheart any day.” Hetty’s fear was allayed by and by, when she found that the coachman made no further allusion to her personal concerns; but it still had the effect of preventing her from asking him what were the places on the road to Windsor.
And yet, before the cruel letter, Arthur had been so tender and loving.
For Hetty could conceive no other existence for herself in future than a hidden one, and a hidden life, even with love, would have had no delights for her; still less a life mingled with shame.
She knew no romances, and had only a feeble share in the feelings which are the source of romance, so that well-read ladies may find it difficult to understand her state of mind.
He would not marry her and make her a lady; and apart from that she could think of nothing he could give towards which she looked with longing and ambition.
Now in her faintness of heart at the length and difficulty of her journey, she was most of all afraid of spending her money, and becoming so destitute that she would have to ask people’s charity; for Hetty had the pride not only of a proud nature but of a proud class—the class that pays the most poor-rates, and most shudders at the idea of profiting by a poor-rate.
She set out walking again; but this day she was fortunate, for she was soon overtaken by a carrier’s cart which carried her to Hinckley, and by the help of a return chaise, with a drunken postilion—who frightened her by driving like Jehu the son of Nimshi, and shouting hilarious remarks at her, twisting himself backwards on his saddle—she was before night in the heart of woody Warwickshire: but still almost a hundred miles from Windsor, they told her.
Perhaps I can let you know where to find him.” “It’s Captain Donnithorne,” said Hetty tremulously, her heart beginning to beat painfully at this disappointment of her hope that she should find Arthur at once.
Now, for the first time, she remembered without indifference the affectionate kindness Dinah had shown her, and those words of Dinah in the bed-chamber—that Hetty must think of her as a friend in trouble.
It was already five days since she had left Windsor, for she had wandered about, always avoiding speech or questioning looks, and recovering her air of proud self-dependence whenever she was under observation, choosing her decent lodging at night, and dressing herself neatly in the morning, and setting off on her way steadily, or remaining under shelter if it rained, as if she had a happy life to cherish.
It was the same rounded, pouting, childish prettiness, but with all love and belief in love departed from it—the sadder for its beauty, like that wondrous Medusa-face, with the passionate, passionless lips.
Hetty’s heart gave a great beat as she thought there must be a pool there.
The very consciousness of her own limbs was a delight to her: she turned up her sleeves, and kissed her arms with the passionate love of life.
Poor wandering Hetty, with the rounded childish face and the hard, unloving, despairing soul looking out of it—with the narrow heart and narrow thoughts, no room in them for any sorrows but her own, and tasting that sorrow with the more intense bitterness!
My heart bleeds for her as I see her toiling along on her weary feet, or seated in a cart, with her eyes fixed vacantly on the road before her, never thinking or caring whither it tends, till hunger comes and makes her desire that a village may be near.
What will be the end, the end of her objectless wandering, apart from all love, caring for human beings only through her pride, clinging to life only as the hunted wounded brute clings to it?
“I’ll be an old bachelor, belike, and make a fuss wi’ thy children.” They turned away from each other, and Seth walked leisurely homeward, mentally repeating one of his favourite hymns—he was very fond of hymns: “Dark and cheerless is the morn Unaccompanied by thee: Joyless is the day’s return Till thy mercy’s beams I see: Till thou inward light impart, Glad my eyes and warm my heart.
Hetty had been deceiving herself in thinking that she could love and marry him: she had been loving Arthur all the while; and now, in her desperation at the nearness of their marriage, she had run away.
The poor thing hadn’t perhaps known her own mind for a long while; had thought that she could forget Arthur; had been momentarily drawn towards the man who offered her a protecting, faithful love.
There were but two alternatives in his mind: either Arthur had written to her again and enticed her away, or she had simply fled from her approaching marriage with himself because she found, after all, she could not love him well enough, and yet was afraid of her friends’ anger if she retracted.
Seth felt that that was the greatest happiness he could look forward to for himself, though he had no hope left that she would ever love him well enough to marry him; but he had often said to himself, it was better to be Dinah’s friend and brother than any other woman’s husband.
He came downstairs and opened the inner door leading from the kitchen into the workshop, intending to let out Gyp; but he stood still in the doorway, smitten with a sudden shock at the sight of Adam seated listlessly on the bench, pale, unwashed, with sunken blank eyes, almost like a drunkard in the morning.
The strong man, accustomed to suppress the signs of sorrow, had felt his heart swell like a child’s at this first approach of sympathy.
“She can’t ha’ loved me.
She didn’t like our marriage when it came nigh—that must be it,” said Adam.
I’m for doing nought but what’s a man’s duty.” The thought that if he betrayed his trouble to his mother, she would only distress him by words, half of blundering affection, half of irrepressible triumph that Hetty proved as unfit to be his wife as she had always foreseen, brought back some of his habitual firmness and self-command.
“She didn’t like our marriage when it came to the point—that must be it.
But if I speak o’ the wrong other people have done, you’ll see I didn’t speak till I’d good reason.” Mr. Irwine nodded slowly, and Adam went on rather tremulously, “You was t’ ha’ married me and Hetty Sorrel, you know, sir, o’ the fifteenth o’ this month.
I thought she loved me, and I was th’ happiest man i’ the parish.
“It’s plain enough she didn’t want to marry me, sir,” said Adam.
There’d been nothing said between me and Hetty then, though I’d loved her for a long while, and she knew it.
But I reproached him with his wrong actions, and words and blows passed between us; and he said solemnly to me, after that, as it had been all nonsense and no more than a bit o’ flirting.
But I made him write a letter to tell Hetty he’d meant nothing, for I saw clear enough, sir, by several things as I hadn’t understood at the time, as he’d got hold of her heart, and I thought she’d belike go on thinking of him and never come to love another man as wanted to marry her.
But I was encouraged to think she loved me, and—you know the rest, sir.
Let ’em put _him_ on his trial—let him stand in court beside her, and I’ll tell ’em how he got hold of her heart, and ’ticed her t’ evil, and then lied to me.
Adam stood motionless, with his eyes vacantly fixed in this way for a minute or two; in that short space he was living through all his love again.
“It’s right they should know it was a fine gentleman made love to her, and turned her head wi’ notions.
I say nothing now, only that his punishment is in other hands than ours.” Mr. Irwine felt it hard upon him that he should have to tell of Arthur’s sad part in the story of sin and sorrow—he who cared for Arthur with fatherly affection, who had cared for him with fatherly pride.
I’ll ne’er lift my hat to him again, nor sit i’ the same church wi’ him... a man as has brought shame on respectable folks... an’ pretended to be such a friend t’ everybody.... Poor Adam there... a fine friend he’s been t’ Adam, making speeches an’ talking so fine, an’ all the while poisoning the lad’s life, as it’s much if he can stay i’ this country any more nor we can.” “An’ you t’ ha’ to go into court, and own you’re akin t’ her,” said the old man.
It is not only you—some fatal influence seems to have shut up her heart against her fellow-creatures.
It’s his work... she was a child as it ’ud ha’ gone t’ anybody’s heart to look at...
He has a heart and a conscience: I can’t be entirely deceived in his character.
I thought she loved me... and was good...” Adam’s voice had been gradually sinking into a hoarse undertone, as if he were only talking to himself; but now he said abruptly, looking at Mr. Irwine, “But she isn’t as guilty as they say?
But think of this: if you were to obey your passion—for it _is_ passion, and you deceive yourself in calling it justice—it might be with you precisely as it has been with Arthur; nay, worse; your passion might lead you yourself into a horrible crime.” “No—not worse,” said Adam, bitterly; “I don’t believe it’s worse—I’d sooner do it—I’d sooner do a wickedness as I could suffer for by myself than ha’ brought _her_ to do wickedness and then stand by and see ’em punish her while they let me alone; and all for a bit o’ pleasure, as, if he’d had a man’s heart in him, he’d ha’ cut his hand off sooner than he’d ha’ taken it.
An act of vengeance on your part against Arthur would simply be another evil added to those we are suffering under: you could not bear the punishment alone; you would entail the worst sorrows on every one who loves you.
And now you mention it, I wish she would come, for it is possible that a gentle mild woman like her might move Hetty to open her heart.
If she saw he bore her no ill will for what she had done to him, she might open her heart to him.
Such a little while ago looking so happy and so pretty... kissing ’em all, her grandfather and all of ’em, and they wishing her luck.... O my poor, poor Hetty... dost think on it now?” Adam started and looked round towards the door.
Bartle entered quietly, and, going up to Adam, grasped his hand and said, “I’m just come to look at you, my boy, for the folks are gone out of court for a bit.” Adam’s heart beat so violently he was unable to speak—he could only return the pressure of his friend’s hand—and Bartle, drawing up the other chair, came and sat in front of him, taking off his hat and his spectacles.
If a man had got no feelings, it ’ud be as good as a demonstration to listen to what goes on in court; but a tender heart makes one stupid.
Everybody in court felt for him—it was like one sob, the sound they made when he came down again.
Mr. Irwine put himself near him and went with him out o’ court.
But Mr. Irwine ’ull leave no stone unturned with the judge—you may rely upon that, Adam.” “Is there nobody to stand by her and seem to care for her in the court?” said Adam.
I’ll go into court.
He only said, “Take a bit, then, and another sup, Adam, for the love of me.
Chapter XLIII The Verdict The place fitted up that day as a court of justice was a grand old hall, now destroyed by fire.
In the broad sunlight of the great hall, among the sleek shaven faces of other men, the marks of suffering in his face were startling even to Mr. Irwine, who had last seen him in the dim light of his small room; and the neighbours from Hayslope who were present, and who told Hetty Sorrel’s story by their firesides in their old age, never forgot to say how it moved them when Adam Bede, poor fellow, taller by the head than most of the people round him, came into court and took his place by her side.
Adam had not dared to look at her in the first moments, but at last, when the attention of the court was withdrawn by the proceedings he turned his face towards her with a resolution not to shrink.
In the corpse we love, it is the _likeness_ we see—it is the likeness, which makes itself felt the more keenly because something else _was_ and _is not_.
But the mother’s yearning, that completest type of the life in another life which is the essence of real human love, feels the presence of the cherished child even in the debased, degraded man; and to Adam, this pale, hard-looking culprit was the Hetty who had smiled at him in the garden under the apple-tree boughs—she was that Hetty’s corpse, which he had trembled to look at the first time, and then was unwilling to turn away his eyes from.
And her prettiness, and her condition, and something respectable about her clothes and looks, and the trouble she seemed to be in made me as I couldn’t find in my heart to send her away at once.
Hetty could not be guilty of the crime—her heart must have clung to her baby—else why should she have taken it with her?
His mind was so occupied with imaginary arguments against such suspicions, that he could not listen to the cross-examination by Hetty’s counsel, who tried, without result, to elicit evidence that the prisoner had shown some movements of maternal affection towards the child.
And I saw it was a little baby’s hand.” At these words a thrill ran through the court.
There was a mingled rustling, whispering, and low buzzing throughout the court during this interval.
Still the sympathy of the court was not with the prisoner.
But the arms could not reach her: she had fallen down in a fainting-fit, and was carried out of court.
The Irwines should dine with him every week, and have their own carriage to come in, for in some very delicate way that Arthur would devise, the lay-impropriator of the Hayslope tithes would insist on paying a couple of hundreds more to the vicar; and his aunt should be as comfortable as possible, and go on living at the Chase, if she liked, in spite of her old-maidish ways—at least until he was married, and that event lay in the indistinct background, for Arthur had not yet seen the woman who would play the lady-wife to the first-rate country gentleman.
Mr. Irwine, who had been a regular correspondent, telling him all the news about the old places and people, had sent him word nearly three months ago that Adam Bede was not to marry Mary Burge, as he had thought, but pretty Hetty Sorrel.
Martin Poyser and Adam himself had both told Mr. Irwine all about it—that Adam had been deeply in love with Hetty these two years, and that now it was agreed they were to be married in March.
That stalwart rogue Adam was more susceptible than the rector had thought; it was really quite an idyllic love affair; and if it had not been too long to tell in a letter, he would have liked to describe to Arthur the blushing looks and the simple strong words with which the fine honest fellow told his secret.
For really she could not have felt much, since she had so soon made up her mind to marry Adam.
It was March now; they were soon to be married: perhaps they were already married.
That little figure coming towards him in the Grove, those dark-fringed childish eyes, the lovely lips put up to kiss him—that picture had got no fainter with the lapse of months.
Strange, how long this sort of influence lasts, for he was certainly not in love with Hetty now.
He had been earnestly desiring, for months, that she should marry Adam, and there was nothing that contributed more to his happiness in these moments than the thought of their marriage.
It was the exaggerating effect of imagination that made his heart still beat a little more quickly at the thought of her.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Many men would have retained a feeling of vindictiveness towards Adam, but _he_ would not—he would resolutely overcome all littleness of that kind, for he had certainly been very much in the wrong; and though Adam had been harsh and violent, and had thrust on him a painful dilemma, the poor fellow was in love, and had real provocation.
His heart swelled agreeably as he said, “Well, Mills, how is my aunt?” But now Mr. Bygate, the lawyer, who had been in the house ever since the death, came forward to give deferential greetings and answer all questions, and Arthur walked with him towards the library, where his Aunt Lydia was expecting him.
But Arthur kissed her tearful face more tenderly than he had ever done in his life before.
My own aunt married her uncle, Martin Poyser.
I entreat you, sir, for the love of our heavenly Father, to let me go to her and stay with her.” “How did you know she was condemned to death, if you are only just come from Leeds?” “I have seen my uncle since the trial, sir.
She is very sullen, and will scarcely make answer when she is spoken to.” “Oh, sir, it may please God to open her heart still.
Don’t let us delay.” “Come, then,” said the elderly gentleman, ringing and gaining admission, “I know you have a key to unlock hearts.” Dinah mechanically took off her bonnet and shawl as soon as they were within the prison court, from the habit she had of throwing them off when she preached or prayed, or visited the sick; and when they entered the jailer’s room, she laid them down on a chair unthinkingly.
I happened to see him at Hayslope the same evening I heard you preach, and recognized him in court to-day, ill as he looked.” “Ah, sir, can you tell me anything about him?
I am grateful to you.” As Dinah crossed the prison court with the turnkey, the solemn evening light seemed to make the walls higher than they were by day, and the sweet pale face in the cap was more than ever like a white flower on this background of gloom.
Dinah stood still for a minute, hesitating to speak because Hetty might be asleep, and looking at the motionless heap with a yearning heart.
The two pale faces were looking at each other: one with a wild hard despair in it, the other full of sad yearning love.
Hetty, without any distinct thought of it, hung on this something that was come to clasp her now, while she was sinking helpless in a dark gulf; and Dinah felt a deep joy in the first sign that her love was welcomed by the wretched lost one.
But it was borne in upon her, as she afterwards said, that she must not hurry God’s work: we are overhasty to speak—as if God did not manifest himself by our silent feeling, and make his love felt through ours.
But she felt the Divine presence more and more—nay, as if she herself were a part of it, and it was the Divine pity that was beating in her heart and was willing the rescue of this helpless one.
But isn’t the suffering less hard when you have somebody with you, that feels for you—that you can speak to, and say what’s in your heart?...
But if you had a friend to take care of you after death—in that other world—some one whose love is greater than mine—who can do everything?...
If you could believe he loved you and would help you, as you believe I love you and will help you, it wouldn’t be so hard to die on Monday, would it?” “But I can’t know anything about it,” Hetty said, with sullen sadness.
God’s love and mercy can overcome all things—our ignorance, and weakness, and all the burden of our past wickedness—all things but our wilful sin, sin that we cling to, and will not give up.
You believe in my love and pity for you, Hetty, but if you had not let me come near you, if you wouldn’t have looked at me or spoken to me, you’d have shut me out from helping you.
I couldn’t have made you feel my love; I couldn’t have told you what I felt for you.
Don’t shut God’s love out in that way, by clinging to sin....
He can’t bless you while you have one falsehood in your soul; his pardoning mercy can’t reach you until you open your heart to him, and say, ‘I have done this great wickedness; O God, save me, make me pure from sin.’ While you cling to one sin and will not part with it, it must drag you down to misery after death, as it has dragged you to misery here in this world, my poor, poor Hetty.
I can’t feel anything like you...my heart is hard.” Dinah held the clinging hand, and all her soul went forth in her voice: “Jesus, thou present Saviour!
She can only feel her heart is hard, and she is helpless.
Look upon her with thy face of love and sorrow that thou didst turn on him who denied thee, and melt her hard heart.
I believe—I believe in thy infinite love.
What is _my_ love or _my_ pleading?
Melt the hard heart.
My heart went like a stone.
But they came and took me away.” Hetty was silent, but she shuddered again, as if there was still something behind; and Dinah waited, for her heart was so full that tears must come before words.
“You will surely come, and let her speak the words that are in her heart.
The pride of her heart has given way, and she leans on me for help and desires to be taught.
This fills me with trust, for I cannot but think that the brethren sometimes err in measuring the Divine love by the sinner’s knowledge.
Tell her, I forgive her; tell her I will come—at the very last.” “I will not urge you against the voice of your own heart,” said Dinah.
She used never to make any return to my affection before, but now tribulation has opened her heart.
But you must remember this: when you thought of marrying her, you’d a notion she’d got another sort of a nature inside her.
“I thought she was loving and tender-hearted, and wouldn’t tell a lie, or act deceitful.
And if he’d never come near her, and I’d married her, and been loving to her, and took care of her, she might never ha’ done anything bad.
Adam lingered in the court half an hour before he could bring himself to send word to Dinah that he was come.
The last time they had met his was when he parted from her with his heart full of joyous hopeful love, and they looked out with a tearful smile from a pink, dimpled, childish face.
It seemed as if her last faint strength and hope lay in that contact, and the pitying love that shone out from Dinah’s face looked like a visible pledge of the Invisible Mercy.
Hetty made an involuntary movement towards him, some of the love that she had once lived in the midst of was come near her again.
She kept hold of Dinah’s hand, but she went up to Adam and said timidly, “Will you kiss me again, Adam, for all I’ve been so wicked?” Adam took the blanched wasted hand she put out to him, and they gave each other the solemn unspeakable kiss of a lifelong parting.
“Close your eyes, Hetty,” Dinah said, “and let us pray without ceasing to God.” And in a low voice, as the cart went slowly along through the midst of the gazing crowd, she poured forth her soul with the wrestling intensity of a last pleading, for the trembling creature that clung to her and clutched her as the only visible sign of love and pity.
And yet, at this moment, there was a stirring of affection at the remembrance of that Arthur Donnithorne whom he had believed in before he had come up to this beech eight months ago.
It was affection for the dead: _that_ Arthur existed no longer.
He is a good fellow.” Adam could not help being moved: it was impossible for him not to feel that this was the voice of the honest warm-hearted Arthur whom he had loved and been proud of in old days; but nearer memories would not be thrust away.
You would know then that it’s worse for me than for you.” Arthur rose from his seat with the last words, and went to one of the windows, looking out and turning his back on Adam, as he continued, passionately, “Haven’t _I_ loved her too?
“I wouldn’t shake hands with you once, sir, when you asked me—but if you’re willing to do it now, for all I refused then...” Arthur’s white hand was in Adam’s large grasp in an instant, and with that action there was a strong rush, on both sides, of the old, boyish affection.
“Adam,” Arthur said, impelled to full confession now, “it would never have happened if I’d known you loved her.
Adam, don’t try to make things worse for me; I’m punished enough without that.” “No, sir, no,” Adam said, looking at Arthur with mournful affection.
The milking of the cows was a sight Mrs. Poyser loved, and at this hour on mild days she was usually standing at the house door, with her knitting in her hands, in quiet contemplation, only heightened to a keener interest when the vicious yellow cow, who had once kicked over a pailful of precious milk, was about to undergo the preventive punishment of having her hinder-legs strapped.
An’ who is it, I should like to know, as you’re bound t’ help and comfort i’ the world more nor your own flesh and blood—an’ me th’ only aunt you’ve got above-ground, an’ am brought to the brink o’ the grave welly every winter as comes, an’ there’s the child as sits beside you ’ull break her little heart when you go, an’ the grandfather not been dead a twelvemonth, an’ your uncle ’ull miss you so as never was—a-lighting his pipe an’ waiting on him, an’ now I can trust you wi’ the butter, an’ have had all the trouble o’ teaching you, and there’s all the sewing to be done, an’ I must have a strange gell out o’ Treddles’on to do it—an’ all because you must go back to that bare heap o’ stones as the very crows fly over an’ won’t stop at.” “Dear Aunt Rachel,” said Dinah, looking up in Mrs. Poyser’s face, “it’s your kindness makes you say I’m useful to you.
Your wish for me to stay is not a call of duty which I refuse to hearken to because it is against my own desires; it is a temptation that I must resist, lest the love of the creature should become like a mist in my soul shutting out the heavenly light.” “It passes my cunning to know what you mean by ease and luxury,” said Mrs. Poyser, as she cut the bread and butter.
I wonder how it is he’s come so early.” Mrs. Poyser hastened to the door for the pleasure of looking at her darling in a new position, with love in her eyes but reproof on her tongue.
Why, Adam, she’ll break your arm, such a big gell as that; set her down—for shame!” “Nay, nay,” said Adam, “I can lift her with my hand—I’ve no need to take my arm to it.” Totty, looking as serenely unconscious of remark as a fat white puppy, was set down at the door-place, and the mother enforced her reproof with a shower of kisses.
“It’s an errand to you brought me, Dinah,” said Adam, apparently unconscious that he was holding her hand all the while; “mother’s a bit ailing, and she’s set her heart on your coming to stay the night with her, if you’ll be so kind.
You shanna have a morsel o’ cake if you behave so.” Tommy, with true brotherly sympathy, was amusing himself by turning Dolly’s skirt over her bald head and exhibiting her truncated body to the general scorn—an indignity which cut Totty to the heart.
It’s easy talking for them as can’t love her so well as her own aunt does.
“You’re ready, I see, Dinah,” Adam said; “so we’ll set off, for the sooner I’m at home the better.” “Mother,” said Totty, with her treble pipe, “Dinah was saying her prayers and crying ever so.” “Hush, hush,” said the mother, “little gells mustn’t chatter.” Whereupon the father, shaking with silent laughter, set Totty on the white deal table and desired her to kiss him.
“It’s a pity, seeing they’re so fond of you.” “You know, Adam, my heart is as their heart, so far as love for them and care for their welfare goes, but they are in no present need.
I know it is a vain thought to flee from the work that God appoints us, for the sake of finding a greater blessing to our own souls, as if we could choose for ourselves where we shall find the fulness of the Divine Presence, instead of seeking it where alone it is to be found, in loving obedience.
“I don’t believe you’d go against the wishes of them that love you, and are akin to you, without a good and sufficient reason in your own conscience.
I shall think of you just as much as I do now, for you’re bound up with what I can no more help remembering than I can help my heart beating.” Poor Adam!
He’s no heart for it yet, and it’s better for others that he should keep away.
“That meeting between the brothers, where Esau is so loving and generous, and Jacob so timid and distrustful, notwithstanding his sense of the Divine favour, has always touched me greatly.
Does he know of you’re going, Dinah?” “Yes, I told him last Sabbath.” Adam remembered now that Seth had come home much depressed on Sunday evening, a circumstance which had been very unusual with him of late, for the happiness he had in seeing Dinah every week seemed long to have outweighed the pain of knowing she would never marry him.
It would be a poor result of all our anguish and our wrestling if we won nothing but our old selves at the end of it—if we could return to the same blind loves, the same self-confident blame, the same light thoughts of human suffering, the same frivolous gossip over blighted human lives, the same feeble sense of that Unknown towards which we have sent forth irrepressible cries in our loneliness.
Let us rather be thankful that our sorrow lives in us as an indestructible force, only changing its form, as forces do, and passing from pain into sympathy—the one poor word which includes all our best insight and our best love.
He did not know that the power of loving was all the while gaining new force within him; that the new sensibilities bought by a deep experience were so many new fibres by which it was possible, nay, necessary to him, that his nature should intertwine with another.
Yet he was aware that common affection and friendship were more precious to him than they used to be—that he clung more to his mother and Seth, and had an unspeakable satisfaction in the sight or imagination of any small addition to their happiness.
He had become used to watching her light quiet movements, her pretty loving ways to the children, when he went to the Hall Farm; to listen for her voice as for a recurrent music; to think everything she said and did was just right, and could not have been better.
Yes, there was one thing that might have been better; she might have loved Seth and consented to marry him.
“It’s wonderful she doesn’t love th’ lad,” Adam had said sometimes to himself, “for anybody ’ud think he was just cut out for her.
But her heart’s so taken up with other things.
She thinks she should be filled up with her own life then, and she’s been used so to living in other folks’s cares, she can’t bear the thought of her heart being shut up from ’em.
She’s never easy but when she’s helping somebody, and marriage ’ud interfere with her ways—that’s true.
It was not possible she should hear anything but self-renouncing affection and respect in his assurance that he was contented for her to go away; and yet there remained an uneasy feeling in his mind that he had not said quite the right thing—that, somehow, Dinah had not understood him.
She opened the window and let in the fresh morning air, and the smell of the sweet-brier, and the bright low-slanting rays of the early sun, which made a glory about her pale face and pale auburn hair as she held the long brush, and swept, singing to herself in a very low tone—like a sweet summer murmur that you have to listen for very closely—one of Charles Wesley’s hymns: Eternal Beam of Light Divine, Fountain of unexhausted love, In whom the Father’s glories shine, Through earth beneath and heaven above; Jesus!
the weary wanderer’s rest, Give me thy easy yoke to bear; With steadfast patience arm my breast, With spotless love and holy fear.
Speak to my warring passions, “Peace!” Say to my trembling heart, “Be still!” Thy power my strength and fortress is, For all things serve thy sovereign will.
You know I do mind parting with you, Dinah?” “Yes, dear friend,” said Dinah, trembling, but trying to speak calmly, “I know you have a brother’s heart towards me, and we shall often be with one another in spirit; but at this season I am in heaviness through manifold temptations.
I am of opinion that love is a great and beautiful thing too, and if you agree with me, the smallest signs of it will not be chips and sawdust to you: they will rather be like those little words, “light” and “music,” stirring the long-winding fibres of your memory and enriching your present with your most precious past.
“The God of love and peace be with them,” Dinah prayed, as she looked back from the last stile.
She only thinks it ’ud be troubling thee for nought, just to come in to say good-bye over again.” “She’d ne’er go away, I know, if Adam ’ud be fond on her an’ marry her, but everything’s so contrairy,” said Lisbeth, with a burst of vexation.
An’ he might be willin’ to marry her if he know’d she’s fond on him, but he’ll ne’er think on’t if somebody doesna put it into’s head.” His mother’s suggestion about Dinah’s feeling towards Adam was not quite a new thought to Seth, but her last words alarmed him, lest she should herself undertake to open Adam’s eyes.
He feels very grateful and affectionate toward Dinah, but he’s no thoughts towards her that ’ud incline him to make her his wife, and I don’t believe Dinah ’ud marry him either.
I don’t think she’ll marry at all.” “Eh,” said Lisbeth, impatiently.
She’ll ne’er marry thee; thee mightst as well like her t’ ha’ thy brother.” Seth was hurt.
He’ll ne’er think o’ marrying if it isna put into’s head, an’ if thee’dst any love for thy mother, thee’dst put him up to’t an’ not let her go away out o’ my sight, when I might ha’ her to make a bit o’ comfort for me afore I go to bed to my old man under the white thorn.” “Nay, Mother,” said Seth, “thee mustna think me unkind, but I should be going against my conscience if I took upon me to say what Dinah’s feelings are.
And besides that, I think I should give offence to Adam by speaking to him at all about marrying; and I counsel thee not to do’t.
Lisbeth, in the pauses of attending to her dinner, always sat opposite to him and watched him, till she could rest no longer without going up to him and giving him a caress, to call his attention to her.
She was encouraged to continue this caress, because when she first went up to him, he had thrown himself back in his chair to look at her affectionately and say, “Why, Mother, thee look’st rare and hearty this morning.
He can’t abide to think I love thee the best.” Lisbeth said nothing, because she wanted to say so many things.
If it had been so that she could ha’ married Seth, that ’ud ha’ been a great blessing to us, but we can’t have things just as we like in this life.
Dinah’s not for marrying; she’s fixed her heart on a different sort o’ life.” “Very like,” said Lisbeth, impatiently, “very like she’s none for marr’ing, when them as she’d be willin’ t’ marry wonna ax her.
She doesna want to marry _him?_ But I can see as she doesna behave tow’rt thee as she daes tow’rt Seth.
Thee think’st thy mother knows nought, but she war alive afore thee wast born.” “But thee canstna be sure as the trembling means love?” said Adam anxiously.
An’ what should she do but love thee?
Adam needed the calm influence; he was amazed at the way in which this new thought of Dinah’s love had taken possession of him, with an overmastering power that made all other feelings give way before the impetuous desire to know that the thought was true.
Her love was so like that calm sunshine that they seemed to make one presence to him, and he believed in them both alike.
And Dinah was so bound up with the sad memories of his first passion that he was not forsaking them, but rather giving them a new sacredness by loving her.
Nay, his love for her had grown out of that past: it was the noon of that morning.
How is it that the poets have said so many fine things about our first love, so few about our later love?
Dost think she’s quite fixed against marrying, Seth?
She calls me her brother, and that’s enough.” “But dost think she might ever get fond enough of anybody else to be willing to marry ’em?” said Adam rather shyly.
And she’s allays seemed clear about that—as her work was to minister t’ others, and make no home for herself i’ this world.” “But suppose,” said Adam, earnestly, “suppose there was a man as ’ud let her do just the same and not interfere with her—she might do a good deal o’ what she does now, just as well when she was married as when she was single.
He turned round, and laying his hand on Adam’s shoulder, said, “Why, wouldst like her to marry _thee_, brother?” Adam looked doubtfully at Seth’s inquiring eyes and said, “Wouldst be hurt if she was to be fonder o’ me than o’ thee?” “Nay,” said Seth warmly, “how canst think it?
“Dinah,” he said suddenly, taking both her hands between his, “I love you with my whole heart and soul.
I love you next to God who made me.” Dinah’s lips became pale, like her cheeks, and she trembled violently under the shock of painful joy.
“Don’t tell me you can’t love me, Dinah.
We must part.” “Not if you love me, Dinah—not if you love me,” Adam said passionately.
“Tell me—tell me if you can love me better than a brother?” Dinah was too entirely reliant on the Supreme guidance to attempt to achieve any end by a deceptive concealment.
She was recovering now from the first shock of emotion, and she looked at Adam with simple sincere eyes as she said, “Yes, Adam, my heart is drawn strongly towards you; and of my own will, if I had no clear showing to the contrary, I could find my happiness in being near you and ministering to you continually.
I fear I should forget to rejoice and weep with others; nay, I fear I should forget the Divine presence, and seek no love but yours.” Adam did not speak immediately.
They sat looking at each other in delicious silence—for the first sense of mutual love excludes other feelings; it will have the soul all to itself.
Who put this great love into our hearts?
You’d follow your conscience as much as you do now.” “Yes, Adam,” Dinah said, “I know marriage is a holy state for those who are truly called to it, and have no other drawing; but from my childhood upwards I have been led towards another path; all my peace and my joy have come from having no life of my own, no wants, no wishes for myself, and living only in God and those of his creatures whose sorrows and joys he has given me to know.
We could not bless each other, Adam, if there were doubts in my soul, and if I yearned, when it was too late, after that better part which had once been given me and I had put away from me.” “But if a new feeling has come into your mind, Dinah, and if you love me so as to be willing to be nearer to me than to other people, isn’t that a sign that it’s right for you to change your life?
Doesn’t the love make it right when nothing else would?” “Adam, my mind is full of questionings about that; for now, since you tell me of your strong love towards me, what was clear to me has become dark again.
I felt before that my heart was too strongly drawn towards you, and that your heart was not as mine; and the thought of you had taken hold of me, so that my soul had lost its freedom, and was becoming enslaved to an earthly affection, which made me anxious and careful about what should befall myself.
For in all other affection I had been content with any small return, or with none; but my heart was beginning to hunger after an equal love from you.
And I had no doubt that I must wrestle against that as a great temptation, and the command was clear that I must go away.” “But now, dear, dear Dinah, now you know I love you better than you love me... it’s all different now.
I have seen that again and again when I have been sitting in stillness and darkness, and a great terror has come upon me lest I should become hard, and a lover of self, and no more bear willingly the Redeemer’s cross.” Dinah had closed her eyes, and a faint shudder went through her.
I don’t believe your loving me could shut up your heart—it’s only adding to what you’ve been before, not taking away from it.
For it seems to me it’s the same with love and happiness as with sorrow—the more we know of it the better we can feel what other people’s lives are or might be, and so we shall only be more tender to ’em, and wishful to help ’em.
And you can help the sick just as much, and you’ll have more means o’ making ’em a bit comfortable; and you’ll be among all your own friends as love you, and can help ’em and be a blessing to ’em till their dying day.
Adam was still holding her hands and looking at her with almost trembling anxiety, when she turned her grave loving eyes on his and said, in rather a sad voice, “Adam there is truth in what you say, and there’s many of the brethren and sisters who have greater strength than I have, and find their hearts enlarged by the cares of husband and kindred.
I have felt as it were a division in my heart.
That life I have led is like a land I have trodden in blessedness since my childhood; and if I long for a moment to follow the voice which calls me to another land that I know not, I cannot but fear that my soul might hereafter yearn for that early blessedness which I had forsaken; and where doubt enters there is not perfect love.
Then I shall know that my calling is not towards marriage.
But we must wait.” “Dinah,” said Adam mournfully, “you can’t love me so well as I love you, else you’d have no doubts.
I can’t doubt it’s right for me to love the best thing God’s ever given me to know.” “Nay, Adam.
It seems to me that my love for you is not weak, for my heart waits on your words and looks, almost as a little child waits on the help and tenderness of the strong on whom it depends.
But no sadness in the prospect of her going away—in the uncertainty of the issue—could rob the sweetness from Adam’s sense that Dinah loved him.
Dost think she will?” “Nay,” said Mrs. Poyser, not sufficiently on her guard against a possible surprise, “she’ll never marry anybody, if he isn’t a Methodist and a cripple.” “It ’ud ha’ been a pretty thing though for ’em t’ marry,” said Martin, turning his head on one side, as if in pleased contemplation of his new idea.
An’ I should be glad to see the poor thing settled like a Christian woman, with a house of her own over her head; and we’d stock her well wi’ linen and feathers, for I love her next to my own children.
An’ she makes one feel safer when she’s i’ the house, for she’s like the driven snow: anybody might sin for two as had her at their elbow.” “Dinah,” said Tommy, running forward to meet her, “mother says you’ll never marry anybody but a Methodist cripple.
“It’s wonderful,” he thought, “how that sound goes to one’s heart almost like a funeral bell, for all it tells one o’ the joyfullest time o’ the year, and the time when men are mostly the thankfullest.
I should never ha’ come to know that her love ’ud be the greatest o’ blessings to me, if what I counted a blessing hadn’t been wrenched and torn away from me, and left me with a greater need, so as I could crave and hunger for a greater and a better comfort.” He expected to see Dinah again this evening, and get leave to accompany her as far as Oakbourne; and then he would ask her to fix some time when he might go to Snowfield, and learn whether the last best hope that had been born to him must be resigned like the rest.
As he curtsied along, with his eyes upturned to the straw knobs imitative of golden globes at the summits of the beehive ricks, which indeed were gold of the best sort, you might have imagined him to be engaged in some pagan act of adoration.
Good-tempered Tim, the waggoner, who loved his horses, had his grudge against Alick in the matter of corn.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I thought she’d ha’ no sperrit for th’ harvest supper.” Mrs. Poyser had thought of Dinah several times since Adam had come in, but she had had “no heart” to mention the bad news.
An’ that’s how it is there’s old bachelors.” “Come, Craig,” said Mr. Poyser jocosely, “you mun get married pretty quick, else you’ll be set down for an old bachelor; an’ you see what the women ’ull think on you.” “Well,” said Mr. Craig, willing to conciliate Mrs. Poyser and setting a high value on his own compliments, “_I_ like a cleverish woman—a woman o’ sperrit—a managing woman.” “You’re out there, Craig,” said Bartle, dryly; “you’re out there.
“Why, I say as some folks’ tongues are like the clocks as run on strikin’, not to tell you the time o’ the day, but because there’s summat wrong i’ their own inside...” Mrs. Poyser would probably have brought her rejoinder to a further climax, if every one’s attention had not at this moment been called to the other end of the table, where the lyricism, which had at first only manifested itself by David’s _sotto voce_ performance of “My love’s a rose without a thorn,” had gradually assumed a rather deafening and complex character.
If her tongue’s keen, her heart’s tender: I’ve seen that in times o’ trouble.
There is a wonderful amount of sustenance in the first few words of love.
Let a woman say what she will after she has once told a man that she loves him, he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first draught she offers him to care much about the taste of the second.
You perceive how it was: Adam was hungering for the sight of Dinah, and when that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage, a lover is likely to still it though he may have to put his future in pawn.
He had often been to Oakbourne and back since that first journey to Snowfield, but beyond Oakbourne the greystone walls, the broken country, the meagre trees, seemed to be telling him afresh the story of that painful past which he knew so well by heart.
Tender and deep as his love for Hetty had been—so deep that the roots of it would never be torn away—his love for Dinah was better and more precious to him, for it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his acquaintance with deep sorrow.
“It’s like as if it was a new strength to me,” he said to himself, “to love her and know as she loves me.
Now she was beginning to wind along the path up the hill, but Adam would not move yet; he would not meet her too soon; he had set his heart on meeting her in this assured loneliness.
Perhaps she had found complete repose without him, and had ceased to feel any need of his love.
Adam was glad, for, with the fine instinct of a lover, he felt that it would be best for her to hear his voice before she saw him.
What a look of yearning love it was that the mild grey eyes turned on the strong dark-eyed man!
And this moment, now you are with me, and I feel that our hearts are filled with the same love.
“Then we’ll never part any more, Dinah, till death parts us.” And they kissed each other with a deep joy.
Chapter LV Marriage Bells In little more than a month after that meeting on the hill—on a rimy morning in departing November—Adam and Dinah were married.
I think there was hardly an inhabitant of Hayslope specially mentioned in this history and still resident in the parish on this November morning who was not either in church to see Adam and Dinah married, or near the church door to greet them as they came forth.
And no wonder they showed this eager interest on her marriage morning, for nothing like Dinah and the history which had brought her and Adam Bede together had been known at Hayslope within the memory of man.
Bessy Cranage, in her neatest cap and frock, was crying, though she did not exactly know why; for, as her cousin Wiry Ben, who stood near her, judiciously suggested, Dinah was not going away, and if Bessy was in low spirits, the best thing for her to do was to follow Dinah’s example and marry an honest fellow who was ready to have her.
Next to Bessy, just within the church door, there were the Poyser children, peeping round the corner of the pews to get a sight of the mysterious ceremony; Totty’s face wearing an unusual air of anxiety at the idea of seeing cousin Dinah come back looking rather old, for in Totty’s experience no married people were young.
I envy them all the sight they had when the marriage was fairly ended and Adam led Dinah out of church.
Bartle Massey had consented to attend the wedding at Adam’s earnest request, under protest against marriage in general and the marriage of a sensible man in particular.
Nevertheless, Mr. Poyser had a joke against him after the wedding dinner, to the effect that in the vestry he had given the bride one more kiss than was necessary.
Behind this last couple came Mr. Irwine, glad at heart over this good morning’s work of joining Adam and Dinah.
The love that had brought hope and comfort in the hour of despair, the love that had found its way to the dark prison cell and to poor Hetty’s darker soul—this strong gentle love was to be Adam’s companion and helper till death.
Adam patted her head and lifted her up to kiss her, but Dinah could see the marks of agitation on his face as she approached him, and he put her arm within his in silence.

As we went, however, in her gondola, gliding there under the sociable hood with the bright Venetian picture framed on either side by the movable window, I could see that she was amused by my infatuation, the way my interest in the papers had become a fixed idea.
As if a woman needed an excuse for having loved the divine poet!
The old woman won’t have the documents spoken of; they are personal, delicate, intimate, and she hasn’t modern notions, God bless her!
You don’t say, ‘Mr.’ Shakespeare.” “Would I, any more, if I had a box full of his letters?” “Yes, if he had been your lover and someone wanted them!” And I added that John Cumnor was so convinced, and so all the more convinced by Miss Bordereau’s tone, that he would have come himself to Venice on the business were it not that for him there was the obstacle that it would be difficult to disprove his identity with the person who had written to them, which the old ladies would be sure to suspect in spite of dissimulation and a change of name.
“To make love to the niece.” “Ah,” cried Mrs. Prest, “wait till you see her!” II “I must work the garden--I must work the garden,” I said to myself, five minutes later, as I waited, upstairs, in the long, dusky sala, where the bare scagliola floor gleamed vaguely in a chink of the closed shutters.
She flitted, at the far end of it, into impenetrable regions, and I looked at the place with my heart beating as I had known it to do in the dentist’s parlor.
I grew used to her afterward, though never completely; but as she sat there before me my heart beat as fast as if the miracle of resurrection had taken place for my benefit.
I had fallen in love at sight with the whole place (she herself probably was so used to it that she did not know the impression it was capable of making on a stranger), and I had felt it was really a case to risk something.
I should have been glad if he had fallen in love with Miss Bordereau’s maid or, failing this, had taken her in aversion; either event might have brought about some kind of catastrophe, and a catastrophe might have led to some parley.
I foresaw that I should have a summer after my own literary heart, and the sense of holding my opportunity was much greater than the sense of losing it.
There could be no Venetian business without patience, and since I adored the place I was much more in the spirit of it for having laid in a large provision.
See how it glows with the advancing summer; how the sky and the sea and the rosy air and the marble of the palaces all shimmer and melt together.” My eccentric private errand became a part of the general romance and the general glory--I felt even a mystic companionship, a moral fraternity with all those who in the past had been in the service of art.
That was what the old woman represented--esoteric knowledge; and this was the idea with which my editorial heart used to thrill.
I on the other hand had hatched a little romance according to which she was the daughter of an artist, a painter or a sculptor, who had left the western world when the century was fresh, to study in the ancient schools.
It was a part of my idea that the young lady had had a foreign lover (and an unedifying tragical rupture) before her meeting with Jeffrey Aspern.
When Americans went abroad in 1820 there was something romantic, almost heroic in it, as compared with the perpetual ferryings of the present hour, when photography and other conveniences have annihilated surprise.
That was originally what I had loved him for: that at a period when our native land was nude and crude and provincial, when the famous “atmosphere” it is supposed to lack was not even missed, when literature was lonely there and art and form almost impossible, he had found means to live and write like one of the first; to be free and general and not at all afraid; to feel, understand, and express everything.
At first I only made out an indistinct figure, not in the least counting on such an overture from one of my hostesses; it even occurred to me that some sentimental maidservant had stolen in to keep a tryst with her sweetheart.
Also English people--the Churtons and the Goldies and Mrs. Stock-Stock, whom they had loved dearly; she was dead and gone, poor dear.
“Why don’t you believe me?” “Because I don’t understand you.” “That is just the sort of occasion to have faith.” I could not say more, though I should have liked to, as I saw that I only mystified her; for I had no wish to have it on my conscience that I might pass for having made love to her.
“Oh, by heart--that’s nothing!” she murmured, smiling.
If I had been late for a love tryst I would have stayed for this, and I quickly signified that I should be delighted to wait upon the old lady.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>But why should she not destroy her papers?” “Oh, she loves them too much.” “Even now, when she may be near her end?” “Perhaps when she’s sure of that she will.” “Well, Miss Tita,” I said, “it’s just what I should like you to prevent.” “How can I prevent it?” “Couldn’t you get them away from her?” “And give them to you?” This put the case very crudely, though I am sure there was no irony in her intention.
I felt this inquiry sufficiently answered when my companion murmured in a musing, almost envious way, “Oh, but she loves them--she loves them!” This reflection, repeated with such emphasis, gave me great comfort; but to obtain more of that balm I said, “If she shouldn’t intend to destroy the objects we speak of before her death she will probably have made some disposition by will.” “By will?” “Hasn’t she made a will for your benefit?” “Why, she has so little to leave.
I suppose you don’t accuse her of making believe!” I forget what reply I made to this, but I grant that in my heart I thought the old woman capable of any weird maneuver.
I couldn’t prevent you--and you would have no responsibility.” She brought out this droll explanation with a little nervous rush, as if she were speaking words she had got by heart.
My gondolier, behind me, must have seen my ears red as I wondered, sitting there under the fluttering tenda, with my hidden face, noticing nothing as we passed--wondered whether her delusion, her infatuation had been my own reckless work.
Did she think I had made love to her, even to get the papers?
I had said to Mrs. Prest that I would make love to her; but it had been a joke without consequences and I had never said it to Tita Bordereau.
I could not, for a bundle of tattered papers, marry a ridiculous, pathetic, provincial old woman.
That question was in my heart; for what had now come to pass was that in the unconscious cerebration of sleep I had swung back to a passionate appreciation of Miss Bordereau’s papers.

memories_and_portraits

Memories of childhood and youth, portraits of those who have gone before us in the battle--taken together, they build up a face that &quot;I have loved long since and lost awhile,&quot; the face of what was once myself.
This has come by accident; I had no design at first to be autobiographical; I was but led away by the charm of beloved memories and by regret for the irrevocable dead; and when my own young face (which is a face of the dead also) began to appear in the well as by a kind of magic, I was the first to be surprised at the occurrence.
Of their descendant, the person of to-day, I wish to keep the secret: not because I love him better, but because, with him, I am still in a business partnership, and cannot divide interests.
Miss Bird, an authoress with whom I profess myself in love, declares all the viands of Japan to be uneatable--a staggering pretension.
So, when the Prince of Wales&#39;s marriage was celebrated at Mentone by a dinner to the Mentonese, it was proposed to give them solid English fare--roast beef and plum pudding, and no tomfoolery.
There are, indeed, few merrier spectacles than that of many windmills bickering together in a fresh breeze over a woody country; their halting alacrity of movement, their pleasant business, making bread all day with uncouth gesticulations, their air, gigantically human, as of a creature half alive, put a spirit of romance into the tamest landscape.
When the Scotch child sees them first he falls immediately in love; and from that time forward windmills keep turning in his dreams.
Yet surely his complaint is grounded; surely the speech of Englishmen is too often lacking in generous ardour, the better part of the man too often withheld from the social commerce, and the contact of mind with mind evaded as with terror.
That you should continually try to establish human and serious relations, that you should actually feel an interest in John Bull, and desire and invite a return of interest from him, may argue something more awake and lively in your mind, but it still puts you in the attitude of a suitor and a poor relation.
The boy of the South seems more wholesome, but less thoughtful; he gives himself to games as to a business, striving to excel, but is not readily transported by imagination; the type remains with me as cleaner in mind and body, more active, fonder of eating, endowed with a lesser and a less romantic sense of life and of the future, and more immersed in present circumstances.
It was in these early days, I think, that Professor Blackie won the affection of his pupils, putting these uncouth, umbrageous students at their ease with ready human geniality.
It proved to be quite otherwise: a mere dumb piece of boyish romance, that I had lacked penetration to divine.
But the error serves the purpose of my argument; for I am sure, at least, that the heart of young Scotland will be always touched more nearly by paucity of number and Spartan poverty of life.
When the Black Watch, after years of foreign service, returned to Scotland, veterans leaped out and kissed the earth at Port Patrick.
They had been in Ireland, stationed among men of their own race and language, where they were well liked and treated with affection; but it was the soil of Galloway that they kissed at the extreme end of the hostile lowlands, among a people who did not understand their speech, and who had hated, harried, and hanged them since the dawn of history.
He has had a different training; he obeys different laws; he makes his will in other terms, is otherwise divorced and married; his eyes are not at home in an English landscape or with English houses; his ear continues to remark the English speech; and even though his tongue acquire the Southern knack, he will still have a strong Scotch accent of the mind.
The chief and far the most lamentable change is the absence of a certain lean, ugly, idle, unpopular student, whose presence was for me the gist and heart of the whole matter; whose changing humours, fine occasional purposes of good, flinching acceptance of evil, shiverings on wet, east-windy, morning journeys up to class, infinite yawnings during lecture and unquenchable gusto in the delights of truantry, made up the sunshine and shadow of my college life.
And truly it must have been thus with Kelland; for as I still fancy I behold him frisking actively about the platform, pointer in hand, that which I seem to see most clearly is the way his glasses glittered with affection.
Seeing him so disordered, they had not the heart to send him away, but gave him a paper and admitted him, still nameless, to the Hall.
I here made friends with a plain old gentleman, a visitor on sunny mornings, gravely cheerful, who, with one eye upon the place that awaited him, chirped about his youth like winter sparrows; a beautiful housemaid of the hotel once, for some days together, dumbly flirted with me from a window and kept my wild heart flying; and once--she possibly remembers--the wise Eugenia followed me to that austere inclosure.
So that at the last, when such a pin falls out--when there vanishes in the least breath of time one of those rich magazines of life on which we drew for our supply--when he who had first dawned upon us as a face among the faces of the city, and, still growing, came to bulk on our regard with those clear features of the loved and living man, falls in a breath to memory and shadow, there falls along with him a whole wing of the palace of our life.
Power seemed to reside in him exhaustless; we saw him stoop to play with us, but held him marked for higher destinies; we loved his notice; and I have rarely had my pride more gratified than when he sat at my father&#39;s table, my acknowledged friend.
The powers and the ground of friendship is a mystery; but, looking back, I can discern that, in part, we loved the thing he was, for some shadow of what he was to be.
Before those who loved him, his memory shines like a reproach; they honour him for silent lessons; they cherish his example; and in what remains before them of their toil, fear to be unworthy of the dead.
One of these has now his name on the back of several volumes, and his voice, I learn, is influential in the law courts.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>In that slender and silken fellow there must have been a rare vein of courage, that he should thus have died at his employment; and doubtless ambition spoke loudly in his ear, and doubtless love also, for it seems there was a marriage in his view had he succeeded.
And yet of these three, two are gone and have left less; and this book, perhaps, when it is old and foxy, and some one picks it up in a corner of a book-shop, and glances through it, smiling at the old, graceless turns of speech, and perhaps for the love of _Alma Mater_ (which may be still extant and flourishing) buys it, not without haggling, for some pence--this book may alone preserve a memory of James Walter Ferrier and Robert Glasgow Brown.
Yet, in the bottom of my heart, I knew that magazine would be a grim fiasco; I knew it would not be worth reading; I knew, even if it were, that nobody would read it; and I kept wondering how I should be able, upon my compact income of twelve pounds per annum, payable monthly, to meet my share in the expense.
I had sent a copy to the lady with whom my heart was at that time somewhat engaged, and who did all that in her lay to break it; and she, with some tact, passed over the gift and my cherished contributions in silence.
Foxgloves, though undoubtedly guilty on the last count, he not only spared, but loved; and when the shrubbery was being thinned, he stayed his hand and dexterously manipulated his bill in order to save every stately stem.
In boyhood, as he told me once, speaking in that tone that only actors and the old-fashioned common folk can use nowadays, his heart grew &quot;_proud_&quot; within him when he came on a burn-course among the braes of Manor that shone purple with their graceful trophies; and not all his apprenticeship and practice for so many years of precise gardening had banished these boyish recollections from his heart.
It was towards his cauliflowers and peas and cabbage that his heart grew warm.
Their sound, their industry, perhaps their sweet product also, had taken hold of his imagination and heart, whether by way of memory or no I cannot say, although perhaps the bees too were linked to him by some recollection of Manor braes and his country childhood.
All day long he had dreamed of the Hebrew stories, and his head had been full of Hebrew poetry and Gospel ethics; until they had struck deep root into his heart, and the very expressions had become a part of him; so that he rarely spoke without some antique idiom or Scripture mannerism that gave a raciness to the merest trivialities of talk.
He was imbued with a spirit of peace and love: he interposed between man and wife: he threw himself between the angry, touching his hat the while with all the ceremony of an usher: he protected the birds from everybody but himself, seeing, I suppose, a great difference between official execution and wanton sport.
Again, two of our friends, who were on intimate terms, and accustomed to use language to each other, somewhat without the bounds of the parliamentary, happened to differ about the position of a seat in the garden.
Perhaps Robert&#39;s originally tender heart was what made the difference; or, perhaps, his solitary and pleasant labour among fruits and flowers had taught him a more sunshiny creed than those whose work is among the tares of fallen humanity; and the soft influences of the garden had entered deep into his spirit, &quot;Annihilating all that&#39;s made To a green thought in a green shade.&quot;
I think shame to leave out one of these enchantresses, but the list would grow too long if I remembered all; only I may not forget Allan Water, nor birch-wetting Rogie, nor yet Almond; nor, for all its pollutions, that Water of Leith of the many and well-named mills--Bell&#39;s Mills, and Canon Mills, and Silver Mills; nor Redford Burn of pleasant memories; nor yet, for all its smallness, that nameless trickle that springs in the green bosom of Allermuir, and is fed from Halkerside with a perennial teacupful, and threads the moss under the Shearer&#39;s Knowe, and makes one pool there, overhung by a rock, where I loved to sit and make bad verses, and is then kidnapped in its infancy by subterranean pipes for the service of the sea-beholding city in the plain.
Crimes were committed, sheep filched, and drovers robbed and beaten; most of which offences had a moorland burial and were never heard of in the courts of justice.
He touched on nothing at least, but he adorned it; when he narrated, the scene was before you; when he spoke (as he did mostly) of his own antique business, the thing took on a colour of romance and curiosity that was surprising.
Thus novels begin to touch not the fine _dilettanti_ but the gross mass of mankind, when they leave off to speak of parlours and shades of manner and still-born niceties of motive, and begin to deal with fighting, sailoring, adventure, death or childbirth; and thus ancient outdoor crafts and occupations, whether Mr. Hardy wields the shepherd&#39;s crook or Count Tolstoi swings the scythe, lift romance into a near neighbourhood with epic.
The river is there dammed back for the service of the flour-mill just below, so that it lies deep and darkling, and the sand slopes into brown obscurity with a glint of gold; and it has but newly been recruited by the borrowings of the snuff-mill just above, and these, tumbling merrily in, shake the pool to its black heart, fill it with drowsy eddies, and set the curded froth of many other mills solemnly steering to and fro upon the surface.
I read him, judging with older criticism the report of childish observation, as a man of singular simplicity of nature; unemotional, and hating the display of what he felt; standing contented on the old ways; a lover of his life and innocent habits to the end.
And I must suppose the old man thought so too, and was either touched or amused by the performance; for he took me in his arms with most unwonted tenderness, and kissed me, and gave me a little kindly sermon for my psalm; so that, for that day, we were clerk and parson.
Now that remedy, as the work of a near kinsman of Rob Roy himself, may have a savour of romance for the imagination; but it comes uncouthly to the palate.
The old gentleman had taken it with a wry face; and that being accomplished, sat with perfect simplicity, like a child&#39;s, munching a &quot;barley-sugar kiss.&quot;
I had had no Gregory; then I should have no barley-sugar kiss: so he decided with a touch of irritation.
I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them.
He was a great lover of Shakespeare, whom he read aloud, I have been told, with taste; well, I love my Shakespeare also, and am persuaded I can read him well, though I own I never have been told so.
He loved port, and nuts, and porter; and so do I, but they agreed better with my grandfather, which seems to me a breach of contract.
In his garden, as I played there, I learned the love of mills--or had I an ancestor a miller?--and a kindness for the neighbourhood of graves, as homely things not without their poetry--or had I an ancestor a sexton?
I have forgotten, too, how we grew up, and took orders, and went to our first Ayrshire parish, and fell in love with and married a daughter of Burns&#39;s Dr. Smith--&quot;Smith opens out his cauld harangues.&quot;
He had a circle of his own, indeed, at home; few men were more beloved in Edinburgh, where he breathed an air that pleased him; and wherever he went, in railway carriages or hotel smoking-rooms, his strange, humorous vein of talk, and his transparent honesty, raised him up friends and admirers.
Natural shrewdness, a sentiment of optical laws, and a great intensity of consideration led him to just conclusions; but to calculate the necessary formulae for the instruments he had conceived was often beyond him, and he must fall back on the help of others, notably on that of his cousin and lifelong intimate friend, _emeritus_ Professor Swan, of St. Andrews, and his later friend, Professor P. G. Tait.
He was actually in favour of a marriage law under which any woman might have a divorce for the asking, and no man on any ground whatever; and the same sentiment found another expression in a Magdalen Mission in Edinburgh, founded and largely supported by himself.
But he found respite from these troublesome humours in his work, in his lifelong study of natural science, in the society of those he loved, and in his daily walks, which now would carry him far into the country with some congenial friend, and now keep him dangling about the town from one old book-shop to another, and scraping romantic acquaintance with every dog that passed.
The spice of life is battle; the friendliest relations are still a kind of contest; and if we would not forego all that is valuable in our lot, we must continually face some other person, eye to eye, and wrestle a fall whether in love or enmity.
Men and women contend for each other in the lists of love, like rival mesmerists; the active and adroit decide their challenges in the sports of the body; and the sedentary sit down to chess or conversation.
Not that the talker has any of the hunter&#39;s pride, though he has all and more than all his ardour.
I remember, in the _entr&#39;acte_ of an afternoon performance, coming forth into the sunshine, in a beautiful green, gardened corner of a romantic city; and as I sat and smoked, the music moving in my blood, I seemed to sit there and evaporate _The Flying Dutchman_ (for it was that I had been hearing) with a wonderful sense of life, warmth, well-being and pride; and the noises of the city, voices, bells and marching feet, fell together in my ears like a symphonious orchestra.
In the same way, the excitement of a good talk lives for a long while after in the blood, the heart still hot within you, the brain still simmering, and the physical earth swimming around you with the colours of the sunset.
I am I, and You are You, with all my heart; but conceive how these lean propositions change and brighten when, instead of words, the actual you and I sit cheek by jowl, the spirit housed in the live body, and the very clothes uttering voices to corroborate the story in the face.
Conduct and art are the two subjects that arise most frequently and that embrace the widest range of facts.
A technicality is always welcome to the expert, whether in athletics, art or law; I have heard the best kind of talk on technicalities from such rare and happy persons as both know and love their business.
I knew three young men who walked together daily for some two months in a solemn and beautiful forest and in cloudless summer weather; daily they talked with unabated zest, and yet scarce wandered that whole time beyond two subjects--theology and love.
And perhaps neither a court of love nor an assembly of divines would have granted their premisses or welcomed their conclusions.
A point arises; the question takes a problematical, a baffling, yet a likely air; the talkers begin to feel lively presentiments of some conclusion near at hand; towards this they strive with emulous ardour, each by his own path, and struggling for first utterance; and then one leaps upon the summit of that matter with a shout, and almost at the same moment the other is beside him; and behold they are agreed.
It is not eloquence, not fairness, not obstinacy, but a certain proportion of all of these that I love to encounter in my amicable adversaries.
This argues that I myself am in the same category; for if we love talking at all, we love a bright, fierce adversary, who will hold his ground, foot by foot, in much our own manner, sell his attention dearly, and give us our full measure of the dust and exertion of battle.
Jack has the far finer mind, Burly the far more honest; Jack gives us the animated poetry, Burly the romantic prose, of similar themes; the one glances high like a meteor and makes a light in darkness; the other, with many changing hues of fire, burns at the sea-level, like a conflagration; but both have the same humour and artistic interests, the same unquenched ardour in pursuit, the same gusts of talk and thunderclaps of contradiction.
He is no debater, but appears in conversation, as occasion rises, in two distinct characters, one of which I admire and fear, and the other love.
Most of us, by the Protean quality of man, can talk to some degree with all; but the true talk, that strikes out all the slumbering best of us, comes only with the peculiar brethren of our spirits, is founded as deep as love in the constitution of our being, and is a thing to relish with all our energy, while yet we have it, and to be grateful for forever.
For many natures there is not much charm in the still, chambered society, the circle of bland countenances, the digestive silence, the admired remark, the flutter of affectionate approval.
They dwell in the heart of life; the blood sounding in their ears, their eyes laying hold of what delights them with a brutal avidity that makes them blind to all besides, their interest riveted on people, living, loving, talking, tangible people.
What remains steadily present to the eye of the retired veteran in his hermitage, what still ministers to his content, what still quickens his old honest heart--these are &quot;the real long-lived things&quot; that Whitman tells us to prefer.
Where youth agrees with age, not where they differ, wisdom lies; and it is when the young disciple finds his heart to beat in tune with his gray-bearded teacher&#39;s that a lesson may be learned.
He had the old, serious love of the play; had even, as he was proud to tell, played a certain part in the history of Shakespearian revivals, for he had successfully pressed on Murray, of the old Edinburgh Theatre, the idea of producing Shakespeare&#39;s fairy pieces with great scenic display.
He loved nothing better than to display his knowledge and memory by adducing parallel passages from Shakespeare, passages where the same word was employed, or the same idea differently treated.
If a man were made of gutta-percha, his heart would quail at such a moment.
In the garden, on the road or the hillside, or _tete-a-tete_ and apart from interruptions, occasions arise when we may learn much from any single woman; and nowhere more often than in married life.
The disputes are valueless; they but ingrain the difference; the heroic heart of woman prompting her at once to nail her colours to the mast.
An automaton he certainly is; a machine working independently of his control, the heart, like the mill-wheel, keeping all in motion, and the consciousness, like a person shut in the mill garret, enjoying the view out of the window and shaken by the thunder of the stones; an automaton in one corner of which a living spirit is confined: an automaton like man.
If a small spoiled dog were suddenly to be endowed with speech, he would prate interminably, and still about himself; when we had friends, we should be forced to lock him in a garret; and what with his whining jealousies and his foible for falsehood, in a year&#39;s time he would have gone far to weary out our love.
And the converse is true; and in the elaborate and conscious manners of the dog, moral opinions and the love of the ideal stand confessed.
Thus, when we regard the manners of the dog, we see a romantic and monogamous animal, once perhaps as delicate as the cat, at war with impossible conditions.
He was not at all a kitchen dog, but the cook had nursed him with unusual kindness during the distemper; and though he did not adore her as he adored my father--although (born snob) he was critically conscious of her position as &quot;only a servant&quot;--he still cherished for her a special gratitude.
The true dog of the nineteenth century, to judge by the remainder of my fairly large acquaintance, is in love with respectability.
The attention of man and the regard of other dogs flatter (it would thus appear) the same sensibility; but perhaps, if we could read the canine heart, they would be found to flatter it in very different degrees.
Doubtless, when man shares with his dog the toils of a profession and the pleasures of an art, as with the shepherd or the poacher, the affection warms and strengthens till it fills the soul.
When, upon any Saturday, we made a party to behold the ships, we passed that corner; and since in those days I loved a ship as a man loves Burgundy or daybreak, this of itself had been enough to hallow it.
the plays themselves, those budgets of romance, lay tumbled one upon another.
The latter colour with gamboge, a hated name although an exquisite pigment, supplied a green of such a savoury greenness that to-day my heart regrets it.
You might, indeed, set up a scene or two to look at; but to cut the figures out was simply sacrilege; nor could any child twice court the tedium, the worry, and the long-drawn disenchantment of an actual performance.
_Sixteen-String Jack_ whom I did not even guess to be a highwayman, troubled me awake and haunted my slumbers; and there is one sequence of three from that enchanted calender that I still at times recall, like a loved verse of poetry: _Lodoiska_, _Silver Palace_, _Echo of Westminster Bridge_.
It may be different with the rose, but the attraction of this paper drama sensibly declined when Webb had crept into the rubric: a poor cuckoo, flaunting in Skelt&#39;s nest.
If, at the ripe age of fourteen years, I bought a certain cudgel, got a friend to load it, and thenceforward walked the tame ways of the earth my own ideal, radiating pure romance--still I was but a puppet in the hand of Skelt; the original of that regretted bludgeon, and surely the antitype of all the bludgeon kind, greatly improved from Cruikshank, had adorned the hand of Jonathan Wild, pl.
The world was plain before I knew him, a poor penny world; but soon it was all coloured with romance.
Indeed, out of this cut-and-dry, dull, swaggering, obtrusive, and infantile art, I seem to have learned the very spirit of my life&#39;s enjoyment; met there the shadows of the characters I was to read about and love in a late future; got the romance of _Der Freischutz_ long ere I was to hear of Weber or the mighty Formes; acquired a gallery of scenes and characters with which, in the silent theatre of the brain, I might enact all novels and romances; and took from these rude cuts an enduring and transforming pleasure.
If you love art, folly, or the bright eyes of children, speed to Pollock&#39;s, or to Clarke&#39;s of Garrick Street.
In Pollock&#39;s list of publicanda I perceive a pair of my ancient aspirations: _Wreck Ashore_ and _Sixteen-String Jack_; and I cherish the belief that when these shall see once more the light of day, B. Pollock will remember this apologist.
I buy, with what a choking heart--I buy them all, all but the pantomimes; I pay my mental money, and go forth; and lo!
Perhaps I think that d&#39;Artagnan delights to have me read of him, and Louis Quatorze is gratified, and Fouquet throws me a look, and Aramis, although he knows I do not love him, yet plays to me with his best graces, as to an old patron of the show.
Madame enchants me; I can forgive that royal minx her most serious offences; I can thrill and soften with the King on that memorable occasion when he goes to upbraid and remains to flirt; and when it comes to the &quot;_Allons_, _aimez-moi donc_,&quot; it is my heart that melts in the bosom of de Guiche.
), where d&#39;Artagnan regains the moral superiority; the love adventures at Fontainebleau, with St. Aignan&#39;s story of the dryad and the business of de Guiche, de Wardes, and Manicamp; Aramis made general of the Jesuits; Aramis at the bastille; the night talk in the forest of Senart; Belle Isle again, with the death of Porthos; and last, but not least, the taming of d&#39;Artagnan the untamable, under the lash of the young King.
The ventripotent mulatto, the great eater, worker, earner and waster, the man of much and witty laughter, the man of the great heart and alas!
Chastity is not near his heart; nor yet, to his own sore cost, that virtue of frugality which is the armour of the artist.
But in Fouquet, the waster, the lover of good cheer and wit and art, the swift transactor of much business, &quot;_l&#39;homme de bruit_, _l&#39;homme de plaisir_, _l&#39;homme qui n&#39;est que parceque les autres sont_,&quot; Dumas saw something of himself and drew the figure the more tenderly.
Athos, with the coming of years, has declined too much into the preacher, and the preacher of a sapless creed; but d&#39;Artagnan has mellowed into a man so witty, rough, kind and upright, that he takes the heart by storm.
I do not say there is no character as well drawn in Shakespeare; I do say there is none that I love so wholly.
And this is the particular crown and triumph of the artist--not to be true merely, but to be lovable; not simply to convince, but to enchant.
Not so to me; I cannot count that a poor dinner, or a poor book, where I meet with those I love; and, above all, in this last volume, I find a singular charm of spirit.
One by one they go, and not a regret embitters their departure; the young succeed them in their places, Louis Quatorze is swelling larger and shining broader, another generation and another France dawn on the horizon; but for us and these old men whom we have loved so long, the inevitable end draws near and is welcome.
It was for this last pleasure that we read so closely, and loved our books so dearly, in the bright, troubled period of boyhood.
This was further afield than my home-keeping fancy loved to travel, and designed altogether for a larger canvas than the tales that I affected.
In another, a lover left a ball, and went walking in a cool, dewy park, whence he could watch the lighted windows and the figures of the dancers as they moved.
{153} Different as they are, all these early favourites have a common note--they have all a touch of the romantic.
Drama is the poetry of conduct, romance the poetry of circumstance.
So it is with names and faces; so it is with incidents that are idle and inconclusive in themselves, and yet seem like the beginning of some quaint romance, which the all-careless author leaves untold.
It is one thing to write about the inn at Burford, or to describe scenery with the word-painters; it is quite another to seize on the heart of the suggestion and make a country famous with a legend.
And yet a little story of a shipwrecked sailor, with not a tenth part of the style nor a thousandth part of the wisdom, exploring none of the arcana of humanity and deprived of the perennial interest of love, goes on from edition to edition, ever young, while _Clarissa_ lies upon the shelves unread.
If he had heard a letter from _Clarissa_, would he have been fired with the same chivalrous ardour?
Yet _Clarissa_ has every quality that can be shown in prose, one alone excepted--pictorial or picture-making romance.
In the highest achievements of the art of words, the dramatic and the pictorial, the moral and romantic interest, rise and fall together by a common and organic law.
But as from a school of works, aping the creative, incident and romance are ruthlessly discarded, so may character and drama be omitted or subordinated to romance.
There is one book, for example, more generally loved than Shakespeare, that captivates in childhood, and still delights in age--I mean the _Arabian Nights_--where you shall look in vain for moral or for intellectual interest.
The sequel is one long-drawn error, gloomy, bloody, unnatural and dull; but as for these early chapters, I do not believe there is another volume extant where you can breathe the same unmingled atmosphere of romance.
Their first meeting by the river, on the other hand, is pure romance; it has nothing to do with character; it might happen to any other boy or maiden, and be none the less delightful for the change.
Thus, in the same book, we may have two scenes, each capital in its order: in the one, human passion, deep calling unto deep, shall utter its genuine voice; in the second, according circumstances, like instruments in tune, shall build up a trivial but desirable incident, such as we love to prefigure for ourselves; and in the end, in spite of the critics, we may hesitate to give the preference to either.
True romantic art, again, makes a romance of all things.
_Robinson Crusoe_ is as realistic as it is romantic; both qualities are pushed to an extreme, and neither suffers.
Nor does romance depend upon the material importance of the incidents.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>To come at all at the nature of this quality of romance, we must bear in mind the peculiarity of our attitude to any art.
This last is the triumph of romantic story-telling: when the reader consciously plays at being the hero, the scene is a good scene.
Then we forget the characters; then we push the hero aside; then we plunge into the tale in our own person and bathe in fresh experience; and then, and then only, do we say we have been reading a romance.
Fiction is to the grown man what play is to the child; it is there that he changes the atmosphere and tenor of his life; and when the game so chimes with his fancy that he can join in it with all his heart, when it pleases him with every turn, when he loves to recall it and dwells upon its recollection with entire delight, fiction is called romance.
Hence it is that a charm dwells undefinable among these slovenly verses, as the unseen cuckoo fills the mountains with his note; hence, even after we have flung the book aside, the scenery and adventures remain present to the mind, a new and green possession, not unworthy of that beautiful name, _The Lady of the Lake_, or that direct, romantic opening--one of the most spirited and poetical in literature--&quot;The stag at eve had drunk his fill.&quot;
In that ill-written, ragged book, _The Pirate_, the figure of Cleveland--cast up by the sea on the resounding foreland of Dunrossness--moving, with the blood on his hands and the Spanish words on his tongue, among the simple islanders--singing a serenade under the window of his Shetland mistress--is conceived in the very highest manner of romantic invention.
The words of his song, &quot;Through groves of palm,&quot; sung in such a scene and by such a lover, clench, as in a nutshell, the emphatic contrast upon which the tale is built.
In _Guy Mannering_, again, every incident is delightful to the imagination; and the scene when Harry Bertram lands at Ellangowan is a model instance of romantic method.
First, as an instance of modern feeling for romance, this famous touch of the flageolet and the old song is selected by Miss Braddon for omission.
For here we have a man of the finest creative instinct touching with perfect certainty and charm the romantic junctures of his story; and we find him utterly careless, almost, it would seem, incapable, in the technical matter of style, and not only frequently weak, but frequently wrong in points of drama.
The man who could conceive and write the character of Elspeth of the Craigburnfoot, as Scott has conceived and written it, had not only splendid romantic, but splendid tragic gifts.
He conjured up the romantic with delight, but he had hardly patience to describe it.
A great romantic--an idle child.
Here Mr. James will recognise the note of much of his own work: he treats, for the most part, the statics of character, studying it at rest or only gently moved; and, with his usual delicate and just artistic instinct, he avoids those stronger passions which would deform the attitudes he loves to study, and change his sitters from the humorists of ordinary life to the brute forces and bare types of more emotional moments.
A novel of this class may be even great, and yet contain no individual figure; it may be great, because it displays the workings of the perturbed heart and the impersonal utterance of passion; and with an artist of the second class it is, indeed, even more likely to be great, when the issue has thus been narrowed and the whole force of the writer&#39;s mind directed to passion alone.
A man, as I read him, of an originally strong romantic bent--a certain glow of romance still resides in many of his books, and lends them their distinction.
A poet, a finished artist, a man in love with the appearances of life, a cunning reader of the mind, he has other passions and aspirations than those he loves to draw.
The obvious is not of necessity the normal; fashion rules and deforms; the majority fall tamely into the contemporary shape, and thus attain, in the eyes of the true observer, only a higher power of insignificance; and the danger is lest, in seeking to draw the normal, a man should draw the null, and write the novel of society instead of the romance of man.

Cheerfulness Again Asserts Itself at Blooms-End, and Clym Finds His Vocation “To sorrow I bade good morrow, And thought to leave her far away behind; But cheerly, cheerly, She loves me dearly; She is so constant to me, and so kind.
she is so constant and so kind.” PREFACE The date at which the following events are assumed to have occurred may be set down as between 1840 and 1850, when the old watering place herein called “Budmouth” still retained sufficient afterglow from its Georgian gaiety and prestige to lend it an absorbing attractiveness to the romantic and imaginative soul of a lonely dweller inland.
It was a spot which returned upon the memory of those who loved it with an aspect of peculiar and kindly congruity.
Then Egdon was aroused to reciprocity; for the storm was its lover, and the wind its friend.
The scene before the reddleman’s eyes was a gradual series of ascents from the level of the road backward into the heart of the heath.
I can tell ’ee lots about the married couple.
“That’s why they went away to be married, I count.
“And now the maid have married him just the same,” said Humphrey.
“’Tis the only sort of party a staid man can feel safe at after the mug have been round a few times.” “Well, I can’t understand a quiet ladylike little body like Tamsin Yeobright caring to be married in such a mean way,” said Susan Nunsuch, the wide woman, who preferred the original subject.
Ah, Humph, well I can mind when I was married how I zid thy father’s mark staring me in the face as I went to put down my name.
He and your mother were the couple married just afore we were and there stood they father’s cross with arms stretched out like a great banging scarecrow.
To save my soul I couldn’t help laughing when I zid en, though all the time I was as hot as dog-days, what with the marrying, and what with the woman a-hanging to me, and what with Jack Changley and a lot more chaps grinning at me through church window.
“Didst ever know a man, neighbour, that no woman at all would marry?” inquired Humphrey.
Ought I to be afeared o’ nights, Master Fairway?” “You’ll have to lie alone all your life; and ’tis not to married couples but to single sleepers that a ghost shows himself when ’a do come.
When folks are just married ’tis as well to look glad o’t, since looking sorry won’t unjoin ’em.
I am no drinker, as we know, but when the womenfolk and youngsters have gone home we can drop down across to the Quiet Woman, and strike up a ballet in front of the married folks’ door.
He should have come afore, if so be he wanted to stop it, and marry her himself.” “Perhaps he’s coming to bide with his mother a little time, as she must feel lonely now the maid’s gone.” “Now, ’tis very odd, but I never feel lonely—no, not at all,” said Grandfer Cantle.
We heard that your niece and her husband were coming straight home as soon as they were married, and we are going down there shortly, to give ’em a song o’ welcome.” “Thank you indeed,” said Mrs. Yeobright.
“And so Tamsin has married him at last,” said Olly, when the incline had become so much less steep that their foot-steps no longer required undivided attention.
But ’a’s clever, that’s true, and they say he was an engineering gentleman once, but has come down by being too outwardly given.” “I saw that, upon the whole, it would be better she should marry where she wished.” “Poor little thing, her feelings got the better of her, no doubt.
Now we shall get along better.” The wedding subject was no further dwelt upon; and soon a faint diverging path was reached, where they parted company, Olly first begging her companion to remind Mr. Wildeve that he had not sent her sick husband the bottle of wine promised on the occasion of his marriage.
She has cried a good deal, but she has hardly spoke; all she has told me being that she was to have been married this morning.
“I know how frightened you are, and how you cannot believe it; but all the same, it is I who have come home like this!” “Tamsin, Tamsin!” said Mrs. Yeobright, stooping over the young woman and kissing her.
“It means just what it seems to mean: I am—not married,” she replied faintly.
When we got there the parson wouldn’t marry us because of some trifling irregularity in the license.” “What irregularity?” “I don’t know.
“I know how wrong it was of me to love him, but don’t pain me by talking like that, Aunt!
He says we can be married in a day or two.” “I wish he had never seen you.” “Very well; then I will be the miserablest woman in the world, and not let him see me again.
“When I found we could not be married I didn’t like to come back with him, and I was very ill. Then I saw Diggory Venn, and was glad to get him to take me home.
We mean to marry, I suppose, don’t we?” “Of course we do.
We have only to go to Budmouth on Monday, and we marry at once.” “Then do let us go!—O Damon, what you make me say!” She hid her face in her handkerchief.
“Here am I asking you to marry me, when by rights you ought to be on your knees imploring me, your cruel mistress, not to refuse you, and saying it would break your heart if I did.
In fact, you are all rather unreasonable.” Thomasin coloured a little, and not with love.
I have not the least intention to refuse to complete the marriage, Tamsie mine—I could not bear it.” “You could not, I know!” said the fair girl, brightening.
This is intolerable!” He began pacing about, the men outside singing cheerily— “He told′ her that she′ was the joy′ of his life′, And if′ she’d con-sent′ he would make her his wife′; She could′ not refuse′ him; to church′ so they went′, Young Will was forgot′, and young Sue′ was content′; And then′ was she kiss’d′ and set down′ on his knee′, No man′ in the world′ was so lov′-ing as he′!” Mrs. Yeobright burst in from the outer room.
Come, Tamsie dear, don’t go making a scene—we must marry after this; that you can see as well as I.
“Well,” said Timothy Fairway, feeling demands upon his praise in some form or other, “’tis a worthy thing to be married, Mr. Wildeve; and the woman you’ve got is a dimant, so says I. Yes,” he continued, to Grandfer Cantle, raising his voice so as to be heard through the partition, “her father (inclining his head towards the inner room) was as good a feller as ever lived.
“Well, be dazed if he who do marry the maid won’t hae an uncommon picture for his best parlour,” said Fairway in a liquid tone, placing down the cup of mead at the end of a good pull.
All then took their leave, wishing their entertainer long life and happiness as a married man, with recapitulations which occupied some time.
You will not be afraid?” She spoke hurriedly, as if her heart had leapt into her throat at the boy’s words.
At this unexpectedly repressing manner in her lover the girl seemed to repress herself also.
“That you did not marry her!” she murmured exultingly.
“And I knew it was because you loved me best, and couldn’t do it.... Damon, you have been cruel to me to go away, and I have said I would never forgive you.
I do not think I can forgive you entirely, even now—it is too much for a woman of any spirit to quite overlook.” “If I had known you wished to call me up here only to reproach me, I wouldn’t have come.” “But I don’t mind it, and I do forgive you now that you have not married her, and have come back to me!” “Who told you that I had not married her?” “My grandfather.
“Did you indeed think I believed you were married?” she again demanded earnestly.
“Then you wronged me; and upon my life and heart I can hardly bear to recognize that you have such ill thoughts of me!
Damon, you are not worthy of me—I see it, and yet I love you.
It is true, is it not,” she added with ill-concealed anxiety, on his making no demonstration, “that you could not bring yourself to give me up, and are still going to love me best of all?” “Yes; or why should I have come?” he said touchily.
I think when I become calm after you woundings, ‘Do I embrace a cloud of common fog after all?’ You are a chameleon, and now you are at your worst colour.
Do you mean to see me again?” “If you own to me that the wedding is broken off because you love me best.” “I don’t think it would be good policy,” said Wildeve, smiling.
I have not yet married her; I have come in obedience to your call.
“What did you mean by that?” “Perhaps I may kiss your hand?” “No, you may not.” “Then I may shake your hand?” “No.” “Then I wish you good night without caring for either.
But it was over in a second, and she loved on.
She knew that he trifled with her; but she loved on.
The mouth seemed formed less to speak than to quiver, less to quiver than to kiss.
Some might have added, less to kiss than to curl.
But celestial imperiousness, love, wrath, and fervour had proved to be somewhat thrown away on netherward Egdon.
The marriage was scarcely in accord with the old man’s wishes, for the bandmaster’s pockets were as light as his occupation.
To be loved to madness—such was her great desire.
And she seemed to long for the abstraction called passionate love more than for any particular lover.
She could show a most reproachful look at times, but it was directed less against human beings than against certain creatures of her mind, the chief of these being Destiny, through whose interference she dimly fancied it arose that love alighted only on gliding youth—that any love she might win would sink simultaneously with the sand in the glass.
On Egdon, coldest and meanest kisses were at famine prices, and where was a mouth matching hers to be found?
Fidelity in love for fidelity’s sake had less attraction for her than for most women; fidelity because of love’s grip had much.
A blaze of love, and extinction, was better than a lantern glimmer of the same which should last long years.
On this head she knew by prevision what most women learn only by experience—she had mentally walked round love, told the towers thereof, considered its palaces, and concluded that love was but a doleful joy.
Her prayer was always spontaneous, and often ran thus, “O deliver my heart from this fearful gloom and loneliness; send me great love from somewhere, else I shall die.” Her high gods were William the Conqueror, Strafford, and Napoleon Buonaparte, as they had appeared in the Lady’s History used at the establishment in which she was educated.
Eustacia had got beyond the vision of some marriage of inexpressible glory; yet, though her emotions were in full vigour, she cared for no meaner union.
In a world where doing means marrying, and the commonwealth is one of hearts and hands, the same peril attends the condition.
What did she say to him, my man?” “Told him she supposed he had not married the other woman because he liked his old sweetheart best; and things like that.” “What did the gentleman say to her, my sonny?” “He only said he did like her best, and how he was coming to see her again under Rainbarrow o’ nights.” “Ha!” cried the reddleman, slapping his hand against the side of his van so that the whole fabric shook under the blow.
I cannot, Diggory, marry you, or think of letting you call me your sweetheart.
There are so many reasons why we cannot be married that I can hardly name them all in a letter.
I did not in the least expect that you were going to speak on such a thing when you followed me, because I had never thought of you in the sense of a lover at all.
The great reason with my own personal self for not letting you court me is, that I do not feel the things a woman ought to feel who consents to walk with you with the meaning of being your wife.
She likes you very well, but she will want me to look a little higher than a small dairy-farmer, and marry a professional man.
I hope you will not set your heart against me for writing plainly, but I felt you might try to see me again, and it is better that we should not meet.
Then came the incident of that day, and the reddleman, still loving her well, was excited by this accidental service to her at a critical juncture to vow an active devotion to her cause, instead of, as hitherto, sighing and holding aloof.
That this way was, of all others, the most distressing to himself, was awkward enough; but the reddleman’s love was generous.
That Eustacia was somehow the cause of Wildeve’s carelessness in relation to the marriage had at once been Venn’s conclusion on hearing of the secret meeting between them.
It did not occur to his mind that Eustacia’s love signal to Wildeve was the tender effect upon the deserted beauty of the intelligence which her grandfather had brought home.
“I have loved you, and have shown you that I loved you, much to my regret; and yet you can come and say in that frigid way that you wish to consult with me whether it would not be better to marry Thomasin.
You have not valued my courtesy—the courtesy of a lady in loving you—who used to think of far more ambitious things.
Love is the dismallest thing where the lover is quite honest.
Don’t you offer me tame love, or away you go!” “I wish Tamsie were not such a confoundedly good little woman,” said Wildeve, “so that I could be faithful to you without injuring a worthy person.
“If you do not love her it is the most merciful thing in the long run to leave her as she is.
She continued, half sorrowfully, “Since meeting you last, it has occurred to me once or twice that perhaps it was not for love of me you did not marry her.
Who would have thought that all this could happen to me?” She interrupted with a suppressed fire of which either love or anger seemed an equally possible issue, “Do you love me now?” “Who can say?” “Tell me; I will know it!” “I do, and I do not,” said he mischievously.
You will love me all your life long.
You would jump to marry me!” “So I would!” said Wildeve.
The day was Sunday; but as going to church, except to be married or buried, was exceptional at Egdon, this made little difference.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>It is that he may refuse to marry Thomasin Yeobright after all.” Eustacia, though set inwardly pulsing by his words, was equal to her part in such a drama as this.
I am not interested in the marriage, and even if I were I could not compel Mr. Wildeve to do my bidding.” “As the only lady on the heath I think you might,” said Venn with subtle indirectness.
Mr. Wildeve would marry Thomasin at once, and make all matters smooth, if so be there were not another woman in the case.
He will never marry her, and yet through her he may never marry the woman who loves him dearly.
Your giving up Mr. Wildeve will be a real advantage to you, for how could you marry him?
Think of the company and the life you’d lead, miss; the gaiety you’d see, and the gentleman you’d marry.
Cessation in his love-making had revivified her love.
Wildeve is not the only man who has asked Thomasin to marry him; and why should not another have a chance?
Mrs. Yeobright, I should be glad to marry your niece and would have done it any time these last two years.
If they marry soon, everybody will believe that an accident did really prevent the wedding.
In short, if it is anyhow possible they must marry now.” “I thought that till half an hour ago.
I have been trying this morning to help on this marriage with Wildeve—yes, I, ma’am—in the belief that I ought to do it, because she was so wrapped up in him.
You may not be aware that another man has shown himself anxious to marry Thomasin.
“One who has been in love with her longer than she has with you.
Suppose, when they are engaged, and everything is smoothly arranged for their marriage, that you should step between them and renew your suit?
I thought I was to have plenty of time to consider.” “Yes, but the situation is different now.” “Explain to me.” “I don’t want to explain, for I may pain you.” “But I must know the reason of this hurry.” “It is simply my ardour, dear Eustacia.
She only says she wishes me to give up Thomasin because another man is anxious to marry her.
He loved her best, she thought; and yet—dared she to murmur such treacherous criticism ever so softly?—what was the man worth whom a woman inferior to herself did not value?
The sentiment which lurks more or less in all animate nature—that of not desiring the undesired of others—was lively as a passion in the supersubtle, epicurean heart of Eustacia.
Her social superiority over him, which hitherto had scarcely ever impressed her, became unpleasantly insistent, and for the first time she felt that she had stooped in loving him.
I wish I hated the heath less—or loved you more.” “You can be painfully frank.
You loved me a month ago warmly enough to go anywhere with me.” “And you loved Thomasin.” “Yes, perhaps that was where the reason lay,” he returned, with almost a sneer.
Damon, how strange it seems that you could have married her or me indifferently, and only have come to me because I am—cheapest!
Come secretly with me to Bristol, marry me, and turn our backs upon this dog-hole of England for ever?
She placed her hand to her forehead and breathed heavily; and then her rich, romantic lips parted under that homely impulse—a yawn.
Her lover was no longer to her an exciting man whom many women strove for, and herself could only retain by striving with them.
She went indoors in that peculiar state of misery which is not exactly grief, and which especially attends the dawnings of reason in the latter days of an ill-judged, transient love.
Their fathers couldn’t do it, and the country was all the better for it.” “Now, I should think, Cap’n, that Miss Eustacia had about as much in her head that comes from books as anybody about here?” “Perhaps if Miss Eustacia, too, had less romantic nonsense in her head it would be better for her,” said the captain shortly; after which he walked away.
What a nunnywatch we were in, to be sure, when we heard they weren’t married at all, after singing to ’em as man and wife that night!
Poor maid, her heart has ached enough about it.
And that man I must marry, for my pride’s sake.” “I am afraid—” began Mrs. Yeobright.
“Ah, you think, ‘That weak girl—how is she going to get a man to marry her when she chooses?’ But let me tell you one thing, Aunt: Mr. Wildeve is not a profligate man, any more than I am an improper woman.
He has an unfortunate manner, and doesn’t try to make people like him if they don’t wish to do it of their own accord.” “Thomasin,” said Mrs. Yeobright quietly, fixing her eye upon her niece, “do you think you deceive me in your defence of Mr. Wildeve?” “How do you mean?” “I have long had a suspicion that your love for him has changed its colour since you have found him not to be the saint you thought him, and that you act a part to me.” “He wished to marry me, and I wish to marry him.” “Now, I put it to you: would you at this present moment agree to be his wife if that had not happened to entangle you with him?” Thomasin looked into the tree and appeared much disturbed.
And I shall marry him.” “Well, wait till he repeats his offer.
I don’t for a moment dispute that it is the most proper thing for you to marry him.
It is the only way out of a false position, and a very galling one.” “What did you tell him?” “That he was standing in the way of another lover of yours.” “Aunt,” said Thomasin, with round eyes, “what _do_ you mean?” “Don’t be alarmed; it was my duty.
“And you will keep the secret of my would-be marriage from Clym for the present?” she next asked.
But, since he loved me once, we will not pain him by telling him my trouble too soon.
To Queen Scheherazade the dream might have seemed not far removed from commonplace; and to a girl just returned from all the courts of Europe it might have seemed not more than interesting.
“It must be here,” said the voice by her side, and blushingly looking up she saw him removing his casque to kiss her.
She was at the modulating point between indifference and love, at the stage called “having a fancy for.” It occurs once in the history of the most gigantic passions, and it is a period when they are in the hands of the weakest will.
The perfervid woman was by this time half in love with a vision.
Hither the mistress, left neglected at home all the year, can steal and observe the development of the returned lover who has forgotten her, and think as she watches him over her prayer book that he may throb with a renewed fidelity when novelties have lost their charm.
It might be that Joe, who fought on the side of Christendom, had a sweetheart, and that Jim, who fought on the side of the Moslem, had one likewise.
During the making of the costumes it would come to the knowledge of Joe’s sweetheart that Jim’s was putting brilliant silk scallops at the bottom of her lover’s surcoat, in addition to the ribbons of the visor, the bars of which, being invariably formed of coloured strips about half an inch wide hanging before the face, were mostly of that material.
Joe’s sweetheart straight-way placed brilliant silk on the scallops of the hem in question, and, going a little further, added ribbon tufts to the shoulder pieces.
“Make it a quarter of an hour,” she said “Yes, Miss Eustacia—I will, if I may kiss it too.
To pass to courtship without acquaintance, to pass to marriage without courtship, is a skipping of terms reserved for those alone who tread this royal road.
She would see how his heart lay by keen observation of them all.
Meanwhile Jim Starks as the Valiant Soldier had come forward, and, with a glare upon the Turk, replied— “If, then, thou art that Turkish Knight, Draw out thy sword, and let us fight!” And fight they did; the issue of the combat being that the Valiant Soldier was slain by a preternaturally inadequate thrust from Eustacia, Jim, in his ardour for genuine histrionic art, coming down like a log upon the stone floor with force enough to dislocate his shoulder.
A series of attentions paid to her, and yet not to her but to some imaginary person, by the first man she had ever been inclined to adore, complicated her emotions indescribably.
She had loved him partly because he was exceptional in this scene, partly because she had determined to love him, chiefly because she was in desperate need of loving somebody after wearying of Wildeve.
Believing that she must love him in spite of herself, she had been influenced after the fashion of the second Lord Lyttleton and other persons, who have dreamed that they were to die on a certain day, and by stress of a morbid imagination have actually brought about that event.
Once let a maiden admit the possibility of her being stricken with love for someone at a certain hour and place, and the thing is as good as done.
Are you really ill?” “Just a little, my old cousin—here,” she said, playfully sweeping her hand across her heart.
There was no knowing what affection might not soon break out between the two, so constantly in each other’s society, and not a distracting object near.
Clym’s boyish love for her might have languished, but it might easily be revived again.
To look far below those who, like a certain fair personator of Polly Peachum early in the last century, and another of Lydia Languish early in this,[1] have won not only love but ducal coronets into the bargain, whole shoals of them have reached to the initial satisfaction of getting love almost whence they would.
To court their own discomfiture by love is a common instinct with certain perfervid women.
Conflicting sensations of love, fear, and shame reduced Eustacia to a state of the utmost uneasiness.
The unreasonable nimbus of romance with which she had encircled that man might be her misery.
“O that she had been married to Damon before this!” she said.
Eustacia was not long in guessing that poor Mrs. Yeobright, in her anxiety for her niece’s future, had mentioned this lover to stimulate the zeal of the other.
“Yes, I have business here.” “Not altogether the selling of reddle?” “It has nothing to do with that.” “It has to do with Miss Yeobright?” Her face seemed to ask for an armed peace, and he therefore said frankly, “Yes, miss; it is on account of her.” “On account of your approaching marriage with her?” Venn flushed through his stain.
It was the sickening feeling which, if the changed heart has any generosity at all in its composition, accompanies the sudden sight of a once-loved one who is beloved no more.
“Why should you tell me that?” It was a bold question, considering the reddleman’s knowledge of her past love; but her undemonstrative manner had power to repress the opinions of those she treated as remote from her.
The truth is, reddleman, that that lady, so far from wishing to stand in the way of Thomasin’s marriage with Mr. Wildeve, would be very glad to promote it.” Venn felt much astonishment at this avowal, though he did not show it clearly; that exhibition may greet remarks which are one remove from expectation, but it is usually withheld in complicated cases of two removes and upwards.
Are you as anxious as ever to help on her marriage?” Venn was a little moved.
“I would sooner have married her myself,” he said in a low voice.
What a strange sort of love, to be entirely free from that quality of selfishness which is frequently the chief constituent of the passion, and sometimes its only one!
Had you been uniformly faithful to me throughout these two years you might now have some ground for accusing me of heartlessness; but if you calmly consider what I bore during the period of your desertion, and how I passively put up with your courtship of another without once interfering, you will, I think, own that I have a right to consult my own feelings when you come back to me again.
’Twas your interest not to do anything which would send me courting Thomasin again, now she has accepted you—or something like it.
Mrs. Yeobright says you are to marry her.
Full of this resolve to marry in haste, and wring the heart of the proud girl, Wildeve went his way.
Venn’s heart sank within him, though it had not risen unduly high.
“I thought as much.” “He wishes the marriage to be at once.” “Indeed!
I would marry him under any circumstances since—since Clym’s letter.” A letter was lying on Mrs. Yeobright’s work-basket, and at Thomasin’s words her aunt reopened it, and silently read for the tenth time that day:— “What is the meaning of this silly story that people are circulating about Thomasin and Mr. Wildeve?
“If you think you can marry him, do so.
If you had gone and married him without saying a word to me, I could hardly have been angry—simply because, poor girl, you can’t do a better thing.” “Don’t say that and dishearten me.” “You are right—I will not.” “I do not plead for him, Aunt.
I hope for the best.” “And so do I, and we will both continue to,” said Mrs. Yeobright, rising and kissing her.
Diggory Venn’s knock came soon after; and Mrs. Yeobright, on returning from her interview with him in the porch, carelessly observed, “Another lover has come to ask for you.” “No?” “Yes, that queer young man Venn.” “Asks to pay his addresses to me?” “Yes; and I told him he was too late.” Thomasin looked silently into the candle-flame.
Years ago she had said that when she married she would braid it in sevens.
That’s why she has gone to him; they have arranged to be married this morning.” “But I can’t understand it,” said Yeobright, rising.
I felt that she was only my niece after all; I told her she might marry, but that I should take no interest in it, and should not bother you about it either.” “It wouldn’t have been bothering me.
Of course, if they had married at that time in a proper manner, I should have told you at once.” “Tamsin actually being married while we are sitting here!” “Yes.
Here was I, knowing nothing; and then I am told all at once that Tamsie is gone to be married.
Do you know, Mother,” he continued after a moment or two, looking suddenly interested in his own past history, “I once thought of Tamsin as a sweetheart?
And when I came home and saw her this time she seemed so much more affectionate than usual, that I was quite reminded of those days, particularly on the night of the party, when she was unwell.
“I don’t think it kind to Tamsin to let her be married like this, and neither of us there to keep up her spirits or care a bit about her.
“Is she married?” Mrs. Yeobright inquired, turning to the reddleman a face in which a strange strife of wishes, for and against, was apparent.
People say she’s a witch, but of course that’s absurd.” The reddleman kept to himself his acquaintance with that fair personage, and also that Eustacia was there because he went to fetch her, in accordance with a promise he had given as soon as he learnt that the marriage was to take place.
On the Sunday morning following the week of Thomasin’s marriage a discussion on this subject was in progress at a hair-cutting before Fairway’s house.
The New Course Causes Disappointment Yeobright loved his kind.
Take all the varying hates felt by Eustacia Vye towards the heath, and translate them into loves, and you have the heart of Clym.
We hadn’t been hard at it for more than a minute when a most terrible screech sounded through church, as if somebody had just gied up their heart’s blood.
</pre></div>

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Whether this romantic martyr to superstition and the melancholy mummer he had conversed with under the full moon were one and the same person remained as yet a problem.
Its smart impact upon the distant water reached their ears like a kiss, whereupon Yeobright knelt down, and leaning over the well began dragging the grapnel round and round as Fairway had done.
I did not know that I had such a magic reputation.” “And you fainted?” said Clym, looking at the scarlet little puncture as if he would like to kiss it and make it well.
I have not much love for my fellow-creatures.
The love between the young man and his mother was strangely invisible now.
Of love it may be said, the less earthly the less demonstrative.
From every provident point of view his mother was so undoubtedly right, that he was not without a sickness of heart in finding he could shake her.
you really mean to marry her?” “It would be premature to state that plainly.
Hardly a maternal heart within the four seas could in such circumstances, have helped being irritated at that ill-timed betrayal of feeling for a new woman.
This marked a preconcerted moment—for the remote celestial phenomenon had been pressed into sublunary service as a lover’s signal.
“I began to wonder why you did not come,” said Yeobright, when she had withdrawn a little from his embrace.
You have been thinking you wished you did not love me.” “How can a man wish that, and yet love on?
No, Eustacia.” “Men can, women cannot.” “Well, whatever I may have thought, one thing is certain—I do love you—past all compass and description.
I love you to oppressiveness—I, who have never before felt more than a pleasant passing fancy for any woman I have ever seen.
Yet I know that we shall not love like this always.
Nothing can ensure the continuance of love.
I loved another man once, and now I love you.” “In God’s mercy don’t talk so, Eustacia!” “But I do not think I shall be the one who wearies first.
Many a man’s love has been a curse to him.” “You are desperate, full of fancies, and wilful; and you misunderstand.
I have an additional reason for seeing you tonight besides love of you.
For though, unlike you, I feel our affection may be eternal.
Will you marry me?” “I cannot tell.” “Now—never mind Paris; it is no better than other spots.
Promise, sweet!” “You will never adhere to your education plan, I am quite sure; and then it will be all right for me; and so I promise to be yours for ever and ever.” Clym brought her face towards his by a gentle pressure of the hand, and kissed her.
And yet, far from that, I could live and die in a hermitage here, with proper work to do.” There was that in his tone which implied distrust of his position as a solicitous lover, a doubt if he were acting fairly towards one whose tastes touched his own only at rare and infrequent points.
She saw his meaning, and whispered, in a low, full accent of eager assurance, “Don’t mistake me, Clym—though I should like Paris, I love you for yourself alone.
They say such love never lasts.
And yet once, I remember, I saw an officer of the Hussars ride down the street at Budmouth, and though he was a total stranger and never spoke to me, I loved him till I thought I should really die of love—but I didn’t die, and at last I left off caring for him.
How terrible it would be if a time should come when I could not love you, my Clym!” “Please don’t say such reckless things.
A perception of the dilemma in which his love had placed him came back in full force.
In spite of Eustacia’s apparent willingness to wait through the period of an unpromising engagement, till he should be established in his new pursuit, he could not but perceive at moments that she loved him rather as a visitant from a gay world to which she rightly belonged than as a man with a purpose opposed to that recent past of his which so interested her.
It meant that, though she made no conditions as to his return to the French capital, this was what she secretly longed for in the event of marriage; and it robbed him of many an otherwise pleasant hour.
Thus as his sight grew accustomed to the first blinding halo kindled about him by love and beauty, Yeobright began to perceive what a strait he was in.
Though his love was as chaste as that of Petrarch for his Laura, it had made fetters of what previously was only a difficulty.
But you give me no peace; you try to thwart my wishes in everything.” “I hate the thought of any son of mine marrying badly!
I wish that you would bestow your presence where you bestow your love!” Clym said huskily, “You are my mother.
When he had reclined for some considerable time, gloomily pondering, he discerned above the ferns a drawn bonnet of white silk approaching from the left, and Yeobright knew directly that it covered the head of her he loved.
His heart awoke from its apathy to a warm excitement, and, jumping to his feet, he said aloud, “I knew she was sure to come.” She vanished in a hollow for a few moments, and then her whole form unfolded itself from the brake.
I love you none the less in telling you; it is only right you should know.” “I have feared my bliss,” she said, with the merest motion of her lips.
Well, these sad and hopeless obstacles are welcome in one sense, for they enable us to look with indifference upon the cruel satires that Fate loves to indulge in.
They formed a very comely picture of love at full flush, as they walked along the valley that late afternoon, the sun sloping down on their right, and throwing their thin spectral shadows, tall as poplar trees, far out across the furze and fern.
“We will be married at once.” “O Clym!” “Do you agree to it?” “If—if we can.” “We certainly can, both being of full age.
We shall, of course, live in absolute seclusion, and our married life will only begin to outward view when we take the house in Budmouth, where I have already addressed a letter on the matter.
Now that he had reached a cooler moment he would have preferred a less hasty marriage; but the card was laid, and he determined to abide by the game.
Whether Eustacia was to add one other to the list of those who love too hotly to love long and well, the forthcoming event was certainly a ready way of proving.
Those gusts which tore the trees merely waved the furze and heather in a light caress.
“And you will part friends with me?” “Certainly, Clym.” “I am going to be married on the twenty-fifth.” “I thought you were going to be married.” “And then—and then you must come and see us.
Good-bye!” He kissed her cheek, and departed in great misery, which was several hours in lessening itself to a controllable level.
This was not the first meeting between the relatives since Thomasin’s marriage; and past blunders having been in a rough way rectified, they could always greet each other with pleasure and ease.
“It is only that he loves her too well.
Miss Vye’s family is a good one on her mother’s side; and her father was a romantic wanderer—a sort of Greek Ulysses.” “It is no use, Thomasin; it is no use.
It is not a passionate quarrel that would have broken my heart; it is the steady opposition and persistence in going wrong that he has shown.
And this is maternity—to give one’s best years and best love to ensure the fate of being despised!” “You are too unyielding.
But I always was a poor, weak, one-idea’d creature—I had not the compass of heart nor the enterprise for that.
“How is it—that she can be married so soon?” “By the will of God and a ready young man, I suppose.” “You don’t mean Mr. Yeobright?” “Yes.
Going to be married so soon—well!” “It isn’t so very soon.” “No; not so very soon.” Wildeve went indoors to the empty room, a curious heartache within him.
Since Thomasin’s marriage Mrs. Yeobright had shown him that grim friendliness which at last arises in all such cases of undesired affinity.
Her son, too, was there, and was now married.
And the chance that would be afforded her, by sending him this gift, of showing how far she was from bearing him ill-will, cheered the sad mother’s heart.
Every man puts in a shilling apiece, and one wins a gown-piece for his wife or sweetheart if he’s got one.” “Well, as that’s not my fortune there’s no meaning in it to me.
Any woman would marry you then.
His daughter married a member of Parliament, and the Bishop of Carlisle stood godfather to one of the children.” “Wonderful!
Is it any harm to raffle with a married lady’s money when, if I win, I shall only keep my winnings, and give her her own all the same; and if t’other man wins, her money will go to the lawful owner?” “None at all.” Wildeve had been brooding ever since they started on the mean estimation in which he was held by his wife’s friends; and it cut his heart severely.
He writhed, fumed, shifted his seat, and the beating of his heart was almost audible.
But Fortune had unmistakably fallen in love with the reddleman tonight.
Wildeve forgot the loss of the money at the sight of his lost love, whose preciousness in his eyes was increasing in geometrical progression with each new incident that reminded him of their hopeless division.
Yeobright did not fear for his own part; but recollection of Eustacia’s old speech about the evanescence of love, now apparently forgotten by her, sometimes caused him to ask himself a question; and he recoiled at the thought that the quality of finiteness was not foreign to Eden.
Now, Eustacia’s dream had always been that, once married to Clym, she would have the power of inducing him to return to Paris.
In the quiet days since their marriage, when Yeobright had been poring over her lips, her eyes, and the lines of her face, she had mused and mused on the subject, even while in the act of returning his gaze; and now the sight of the books, indicating a future which was antagonistic to her dream, struck her with a positively painful jar.
Yet Yeobright was as firm in the contrary intention as if the tendency of marriage were rather to develop the fantasies of young philanthropy than to sweep them away.
That Wildeve should have got command of the guineas after all, and should rearrange the disposal of them, placing Clym’s share in Clym’s wife’s hands, because she had been his own sweetheart, and might be so still, was as irritating a pain as any that Mrs. Yeobright had ever borne.
She started at two o’clock, and her meeting with Eustacia was hastened by the appearance of the young lady beside the pool and bank which bordered her grandfather’s premises, where she stood surveying the scene, and perhaps thinking of the romantic enactments it had witnessed in past days.
“I have not injured him by marrying him!
I was firmly convinced that he ought not to marry you—therefore I tried to dissuade him by all the means in my power.
“And if I had known then what I know now, that I should be living in this wild heath a month after my marriage, I—I should have thought twice before agreeing.” “It would be better not to say that; it might not sound truthful.
I insist upon repeating to you that had I known that my life would from my marriage up to this time have been as it is, I should have said _No_.
Do you think I am an evil-disposed person?” “You injured me before my marriage, and you have now suspected me of secretly favouring another man for money!” “I could not help what I thought.
Who can be worse than a wife who encourages a lover, and poisons her husband’s mind against his relative?
If anyone says that I attempted to stop your marriage by any but honest means, that person, too, does not speak the truth.
But his intention was unshaken, though he loved Eustacia well.
It is the effect of marriage to engender in several directions some of the reserve it annihilates in one.
Bees hummed around his ears with an intimate air, and tugged at the heath and furze-flowers at his side in such numbers as to weigh them down to the sod.
Unconscious of her presence, he still went on singing:— “Le point du jour A nos bosquets rend toute leur parure; Flore est plus belle à son retour; L’oiseau reprend doux chant d’amour; Tout célèbre dans la nature Le point du jour.
“Le point du jour Cause parfois, cause douleur extrême; Que l’espace des nuits est court Pour le berger brûlant d’amour, Forcé de quitter ce qu’il aime Au point du jour.” It was bitterly plain to Eustacia that he did not care much about social failure; and the proud fair woman bowed her head and wept in sick despair at thought of the blasting effect upon her own life of that mood and condition in him.
Has your love for me all died, then, because my appearance is no longer that of a fine gentleman?” “Dearest, you must not question me unpleasantly, or it may make me not love you.” “Do you believe it possible that I would run the risk of doing that?” “Well, you follow out your own ideas, and won’t give in to mine when I wish you to leave off this shameful labour.
A woman may have reason, though she is not without heart, and if I felt ‘worse luck,’ it was no ignoble feeling—it was only too natural.
Do you remember how, before we were married, I warned you that I had not good wifely qualities?” “You mock me to say that now.
No true lover would have seen any such thing; you are too severe upon me, Clym—I won’t like your speaking so at all.” “Well, I married you in spite of it, and don’t regret doing so.
and yet I used to think there never was a warmer heart than yours.” “Yes, I fear we are cooling—I see it as well as you,” she sighed mournfully.
“And how madly we loved two months ago!
There are other things for me to sigh for, or any other woman in my place.” “That your chances in life are ruined by marrying in haste an unfortunate man?” “Why will you force me, Clym, to say bitter things?
And so love dies with good fortune!” “I cannot listen to this, Clym—it will end bitterly,” she said in a broken voice.
There was a forlorn look about her beautiful eyes which, whether she deserved it or not, would have excited pity in the breast of anyone who had known her during the full flush of her love for Clym.
You have all my heart yet, I believe; and because you bear with me, who am in truth a drag upon you, I owe you thanks.
My hook and gloves are like the St. Lazarus rattle of the leper, warning the world to get out of the way of a sight that would sadden them.” He kissed her, put on his leggings, and went out.
For the time paganism was revived in their hearts, the pride of life was all in all, and they adored none other than themselves.
Till this moment he had not met her eye since the morning of his marriage, when she had been loitering in the church, and had startled him by lifting her veil and coming forward to sign the register as witness.
Obstacles were a ripening sun to his love, and he was at this moment in a delirium of exquisite misery.
He had long since begun to sigh again for Eustacia; indeed, it may be asserted that signing the marriage register with Thomasin was the natural signal to his heart to return to its first quarters, and that the extra complication of Eustacia’s marriage was the one addition required to make that return compulsory.
I thought, in common with other people, that he would have taken you off to a home in Paris immediately after you had married him.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>At this time, as has been seen, Wildeve was quite innocent of any predetermined act of intrigue, and except at the dance on the green he had not once met Eustacia since her marriage.
But that the spirit of intrigue was in him had been shown by a recent romantic habit of his—a habit of going out after dark and strolling towards Alderworth, there looking at the moon and stars, looking at Eustacia’s house, and walking back at leisure.
He had nipped in the bud the possible meeting between Eustacia and her old lover this very night.
“Now, ma’am, depend upon it,” he said, “you couldn’t do a better thing for either of ’em than to make yourself at home in their houses, even if there should be a little rebuff at first.” “Both she and my son disobeyed me in marrying; therefore I have no interest in their households.
The marriage is unalterable, my life may be cut short, and I should wish to die in peace.
He did not even desire Clym’s absence, since it was just possible that Eustacia might resent any situation which could compromise her dignity as a wife, whatever the state of her heart towards him.
“Well, if that means that your marriage is a misfortune to you, you know who is to blame,” said Wildeve.
“The marriage is no misfortune in itself,” she retorted with some little petulance.
Men are given to the trick of having a passing fancy for somebody else in the midst of a permanent love, which reasserts itself afterwards just as before.
On account of your rebellious manner to me I was tempted to go further than I should have done; and when you still would keep playing the same tantalizing part I went further still, and married her.” Turning and looking again at the unconscious form of Clym, he murmured, “I am afraid that you don’t value your prize, Clym....
Yet I thought I saw the way to it in my Clym.” “And you only married him on that account?” “There you mistake me.
I married him because I loved him, but I won’t say that I didn’t love him partly because I thought I saw a promise of that life in him.” “You have dropped into your old mournful key.” “But I am not going to be depressed,” she cried perversely.
You mean, Damon, that you still love me.
Well, that gives me sorrow, for I am not made so entirely happy by my marriage that I am willing to spurn you for the information, as I ought to do.
Upon my eternal honour I came for no more.” Wildeve kissed his hand to the beautiful girl he addressed, and passed into the garden, where she watched him down the path, over the stile at the end, and into the ferns outside, which brushed his hips as he went along till he became lost in their thickets.
What does it all mean?” At that moment the chasm in their lives which his love for Eustacia had caused was not remembered by Yeobright, and to him the present joined continuously with that friendly past that had been their experience before the division.
“Well, this is a bad night altogether for them that have done well in their time; and if I were ever such a dab at the hautboy or tenor viol, I shouldn’t have the heart to play tunes upon ’em now.” Susan now arrived with the frying pan, when the live adder was killed and the heads of the three taken off.
Though she was no lover of money she loved what money could bring; and the new accessories she imagined around him clothed Wildeve with a great deal of interest.
“Had he been a man to bear a jilt ill-will he would have told me of his good fortune in crowing tones; instead of doing that he mentioned not a word, in deference to my misfortunes, and merely implied that he loved me still, as one superior to him.” Wildeve’s silence that day on what had happened to him was just the kind of behaviour calculated to make an impression on such a woman.
She was disturbed in her reverie by a voice behind, and turning her head beheld the old lover and fortunate inheritor of wealth immediately beside her.
You sent me a letter; and my heart ached to read that as I hope yours never will.
This sort of thing would have an odd look if known.” “Very well, I will leave you.” He took her hand unexpectedly, and kissed it—for the first time since her marriage.
“What light is that on the hill?” he added, as it were to hide the caress.
Her heart was previously affected, and physical exhaustion has dealt the finishing blow.” Then there was a weeping of women, then waiting, then hushed exclamations, then a strange gasping sound, then a painful stillness.
I would have taken her in and showed her how I loved her in spite of all.
I know that, if she had lived, you would have been reconciled with her.” “But she didn’t come to see me, though I asked her, before I married, if she would come.
When his mind had been weaker his heart had led him to speak out; but reason having now somewhat recovered itself he sank into taciturnity.
Good heart of God!—what does it mean?” The child shrank away from the gaze of his questioner.
The superstratum of timidity which often overlies those who are daring and defiant at heart had been passed through, and the mettlesome substance of the woman was reached.
You hated her just as she was learning to love you.
Did not one grain of pity enter your heart as she turned away?
All persons of refinement have been scared away from me since I sank into the mire of marriage.
“Well, yes, I’ll take it, if only for the sake of my own foolish kisses that were wasted there before I knew what I cherished.
“This unhappy marriage of mine to be perpetuated in that child’s name!” IV.
Charley had always regarded Eustacia as Eustacia had regarded Clym when she first beheld him—as a romantic and sweet vision, scarcely incarnate.
His dread was lest she should think fit to return to Alderworth, and in that dread his eyes, with all the inquisitiveness of affection, frequently sought her face when she was not observing him, as he would have watched the head of a stockdove to learn if it contemplated flight.
Then she walked into the enclosed plot and looked through her grandfather’s spyglass, as she had been in the habit of doing before her marriage.
Had Eustacia received the stone full in the bosom her heart could not have given a more decided thump.
“I—I—” she began, and then burst into quivering sobs, shaken to the very heart by the unexpected voice of pity—a sentiment whose existence in relation to herself she had almost forgotten.
Only say it, and I’ll do anything to put an end to those tears, which but for me would never have been at all.” “We are each married to another person,” she said faintly; “and assistance from you would have an evil sound—after—after—” “Well, there’s no preventing slanderers from having their fill at any time; but you need not be afraid.
Before going to bed he sat down and wrote the following letter:— MY DEAR EUSTACIA,—I must obey my heart without consulting my reason too closely.
Our love must still continue.
I could not ask you back at first, Eustacia, for I was unable to persuade myself that he who was with you was not there as a lover.
Surely not, when you remember the kisses and vows we exchanged under the summer moon.
Fidelity to her husband had that evening induced her to conceal all suspicion that Wildeve’s interest in Eustacia had not ended with his marriage.
The glory which had encircled him as her lover was departed now; yet some good simple quality of his would occasionally return to her memory and stir a momentary throb of hope that he would again present himself before her.
she had no business to marry him.
To ask Wildeve for pecuniary aid without allowing him to accompany her was impossible to a woman with a shadow of pride left in her; to fly as his mistress—and she knew that he loved her—was of the nature of humiliation.
But to break my marriage vow for him—it is too poor a luxury!...
Thomasin briefly kissed the baby, and then found time to begin crying as she said, “I brought baby, for I was afraid what might happen to her.
Well, I was always against the marriage, and I was right.” “Are you going with me?” said Yeobright, paying no attention to the captain’s latter remark.
But the least part of Thomasin was in the house, for her heart being at ease about the little girl upstairs she was mentally following Clym on his journey.
I think you have proved that I can be trusted.” “There are some things that cannot be—cannot be told to—” And then her heart rose into her throat, and she could say no more.
And though he meant to adhere to Eustacia’s instructions to the letter, to deposit her where she wished and to leave her, should that be her will, the spell that she had cast over him intensified, and his heart was beating fast in the anticipated futility of such commands in the face of a mutual wish that they should throw in their lot together.
At this moment his heart bounded to hear footsteps running towards him, and two men, roused by Thomasin, appeared at the brink above.
All the known incidents of their love were enlarged, distorted, touched up, and modified, till the original reality bore but a slight resemblance to the counterfeit presentation by surrounding tongues.
The year previous Thomasin had hardly been conscious of the season’s advance; this year she laid her heart open to external influences of every kind.
She was dressed more gaily than Yeobright had ever seen her dressed since the time of Wildeve’s death, eighteen months before; since the day of her marriage even she had not exhibited herself to such advantage.
His passion for her had occurred too far on in his manhood to leave fuel enough on hand for another fire of that sort, as may happen with more boyish loves.
Even supposing him capable of loving again, that love would be a plant of slow and laboured growth, and in the end only small and sickly, like an autumn-hatched bird.
Then placing it in his breastpocket—the nearest receptacle to a man’s heart permitted by modern raiment—he ascended the valley in a mathematically direct line towards his distant home in the meadows.
“I cannot for my life think who it is that Diggory Venn is so much in love with.
But he felt this as an economist merely, and not as a lover.
So far the obvious thing was not to entertain any idea of marriage with Thomasin, even to oblige her.
Had only Yeobright’s own future been involved he would have proposed to Thomasin with a ready heart.
But he dreaded to contemplate Thomasin wedded to the mere corpse of a lover that he now felt himself to be.
“I am thinking of marrying,” she then observed blandly.
“But I shall not marry unless you assure me that you approve of such a step.
At the same time I must marry him if I marry anybody—that I _will_ say!” “I don’t see that,” said Clym, carefully concealing every clue to his own interrupted intention, which she plainly had not guessed.
“You might marry a professional man, or somebody of that sort, by going into the town to live and forming acquaintances there.” “I am not fit for town life—so very rural and silly as I always have been.
“Then how could you say that I should marry some town man?
I am sure, say what you will, that I must marry Diggory, if I marry at all.
“Well, I wish with all my heart that I could say, marry him.
Clym, though vexed at what seemed her unaccountable taste, was in a measure relieved to find that at any rate the marriage question in relation to himself was shelved.
But, Mr. Yeobright, I can’t help feeling that your cousin ought to have married you.
You could get her away from him now, ’tis my belief, if you were only to set about it.” “How can I have the conscience to marry after having driven two women to their deaths?
My sex owes you every amends for the treatment you received in days gone by.”* [*] The writer may state here that the original conception of the story did not design a marriage between Thomasin and Venn.
I set up both my own daughters in one when they was married, and there have been feathers enough for another in the house the last twelve months.
“In common conscience every man ought either to marry or go for a soldier.
“But as to marrying, I own I’ve asked here and there, though without much fruit from it.
“Empt some more feathers into the bed-tick, and keep up yer heart.
There’s time enough left to ye yet to fill whole chronicles.” “Begad, I’ll go to ’em, Timothy—to the married pair!” said Granfer Cantle in an encouraged voice, and starting round briskly.
To be sure, how quick marrying can be done when you are in the mind for’t!” “O yes, it can soon be _done_,” said Fairway, as if something should be added to make the statement complete.
Eustacia had frequently told him of Charley’s romantic attachment.
He kissed the packet, put it in his pocket, and said in a voice of emotion, “O, Mr. Clym, how good you are to me!” “I will go a little way with you,” said Clym.
But his heart was heavy, that Mother had _not_ crowned him in the day of his espousals and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

&quot;&#39;Thy tower another banner knows, thy steeds another rein, And stoop them to another&#39;s will, thy gallant vassal train; And she, the lady of thy love, so faithful once and fair, This night, within thy father&#39;s hall, she weds Marstetten&#39;s heir.&#39;&quot;
The baron proceeds to the Castle gate, which is bolted to prevent intrusion, while the inside of the mansion rung with preparations for the marriage of the lady.
&quot;Then up the hall paced Moringer, his step was sad and slow; It sat full heavy on his heart, none seemed their lord to know.
There is also, in the rich field of German romance, another edition of this story, which has been converted by M. Tieck (whose labours of that kind have been so remarkable) into the subject of one of his romantic dramas.
Sir William Bradshaghe 2d Sone to Sr John was a great traveller and a Souldyer and married To Mabell daughter and Sole heire of Hugh Noris de Haghe and Blackrode and had issue EN.
E 2. of this Mabel is a story by tradition of undouted verity that in Sr William Bradshage&#39;s absence (being 10 yeares away in the wares) she married a welsh kt.
He was so much struck with it, that being at that time profuse of legendary lore, he inserted it in the shape of a note to Waverley, the first of his romantic offences.
The undaunted resolution and stubborn ferocity of Gwenwyn, descendant of that prince, had long made him beloved among the &quot;Tall men&quot; or Champions of Wales; and he was enabled, more by the number of those who served under him, attracted by his reputation, than by the natural strength of his dilapidated principality, to retaliate the encroachments of the English by the most wasteful inroads.
There was indeed another objection, which in later times would have been of considerable weight--Gwenwyn was already married.
But Brengwain was a childless bride; sovereigns (and among sovereigns the Welsh prince ranked himself) marry for lineage, and the Pope was not likely to be scrupulous, where the question was to oblige a prince who had assumed the Cross with such ready zeal, even although, in fact, his thoughts had been much more on the Garde Doloureuse than on Jerusalem.
[Footnote: It is said in Highland tradition, that one of the Macdonalds of the Isles, who had suffered his broadsword to remain sheathed for some months after his marriage with a beautiful woman, was stirred to a sudden and furious expedition against the mainland by hearing conversation to the above purpose among his bodyguard.]
A Norman would have despised the barbarous magnificence of an entertainment, consisting of kine and sheep roasted whole, of goat&#39;s flesh and deer&#39;s flesh seethed in the skins of the animals themselves; for the Normans piqued themselves on the quality rather than the quantity of their food, and, eating rather delicately than largely, ridiculed the coarser taste of the Britons, although the last were in their banquets much more moderate than were the Saxons; nor would the oceans of _Crw_ and hydromel, which overwhelmed the guests like a deluge, have made up, in their opinion, for the absence of the more elegant and costly beverage which they had learnt to love in the south of Europe.
The same right of sovereignty, which assigned to Gwenwyn his golden crownlet, gave him a title to the attendance of the foot-bearer, or youth, who lay on the rushes, and whose duty it was to cherish the Prince&#39;s feet in his lap or bosom.
What were the chase, if the deer dropped at our feet the instant he started from the cover--or what value were there in the love of the maiden, were it yielded without coy delay?&quot;
Moreover, our daughter Eveline hath been sought in marriage by a noble and potent Lord of the Marches, Hugo de Lacy, the Constable of Chester, to which most honourable suit we have returned a favourable answer.
--He paused, and then, well understanding the firm, yet melancholy glance, with which his master answered the question, he proceeded, with yet more vehement earnestness--&quot;You cannot mean it--you cannot intend that we shall quit this castle, which we have so often made good against them, and contend in the field with two hundred men against thousands?-- Think better of it, my beloved master, and let not the rashness of your old age blemish that character for wisdom and warlike skill, which your former life has so nobly won.&quot;
&quot;I am not angry with you for blaming my purpose, Dennis,&quot; answered the Norman, &quot;for I know you do it in love to me and mine.
The tears gushed from the old warrior&#39;s eyes as fast as from those of a girl who weeps for her lover; and Raymond, taking him kindly by the hand, said, in a soothing tone, &quot;Do not think, my good old servant, that, were honour to be won, I would drive thee from my side.
Thou wouldst not, I know, from a miscontrued point of honour, or a blind love to me, leave this important place, and the safety of Eveline, in doubtful hands?&quot;
&quot;A flagon of Rhenish, if you love me,&quot; answered the Fleming, &quot;for my heart is low and poor within me, and I must needs drink of the best.&quot;
&quot;Nay, the flagon--the flagon, friend Reinold; I love a deep and solemn draught when the business is weighty,&quot; said Wilkin.
I feel it hath done me much good--my heart was sinking when I saw the black smoke arising from mine own fulling-mills yonder.
What think you of ale, an invigorating, strengthening liquor, that warms the heart without inflaming the brain?&quot;
But when large bodies of the white-mantled Welshmen were permitted without interruption to take such order on the plain as their habits of fighting recommended, the monk&#39;s countenance, though he still endeavoured to speak encouragement to the terrified Eveline, assumed a different and an anxious expression; and his acquired habits of resignation contended strenuously with his ancient military ardour.
But even while he clung to this hope, the monk&#39;s heart sunk within him, as, looking in every direction from which the expected succours might arrive, he could neither see nor hear the slightest token which announced their approach.
The daughter of the slaughtered Raymond had descended from the elevated station whence she had beheld the field of battle, in the agony of grief natural to a child whose eyes have beheld the death of an honoured and beloved father.
But if there was such a hope, as something selfish will often mingle with our noblest and purest emotions, it arose unconscious of Eveline herself, who, in the full assurance of implicit faith, and fixing on the representative of her adoration, eyes in which the most earnest supplication, the most humble confidence, struggled with unbidden tears, was perhaps more beautiful than when, young as she was, she was selected to bestow the prize of chivalry in the lists of Chester.
Here one or two females still knelt before the saints which the walls and niches presented for adoration; but the rest of the terrified suppliants, too anxious to prolong their devotions, had dispersed through the castle to learn tidings of their friends, and to obtain some refreshment, or at least some place of repose for themselves and their families.
my beloved daughter-- we are dreadfully beset--foemen without--traitors within!--The false Fleming, Wilkin Flammock, is treating for the surrender of the castle!&quot;
This she spoke with an imploring tone of voice, mingled with sobs, as if her heart had been breaking.
Rose&#39;s countenance fell when she heard her father bluntly avow the treasonable communication of which she had thought him incapable-- she dropt the hand by which she had dragged him into the chapel, and stared on the Lady Eveline, with eyes which seemed starting from their sockets, and a countenance from which the blood, with which it was so lately highly coloured, had retreated to garrison the heart.
said Rose, eagerly interrupting her, and kissing her hand.
my good son,&quot; said the disappointed confessor, &quot;this gear can lie over--this is no time for marrying or giving in marriage, when we are all like to be murdered.&quot;
Is it not answered again, _Qui jurat proximo et non decipit?_--Go to, my son--break not thy plighted word for a little filthy lucre--better is an empty stomach and an hungry heart with a clear conscience, than a fatted ox with iniquity and wordbreaking.--Sawest thou not our late noble lord, who (may his soul be happy!)
The English she reminded of their good faith and honesty of heart; and to the Flemings she spoke of the destruction of their property, the fruits of their honest industry.
And, indeed, conscious that she had done all that was incumbent upon her, and fearful lest the chill which she felt creeping over her own heart should infect others, Eveline took her vassal&#39;s advice, and withdrew slowly to her own apartment, often casting back her eye to the place where the Welsh, now drawn out and under arms, were advancing their ridgy battalions, like the waves of an approaching tide.

</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Much lightened at heart by finding they had no ghost to deal with, Wilkin Flammock and the priest advanced hastily to the platform, where they found the lady with her faithful Rose, the former with a half-pike in her hand, like a sentinel on duty.
All was still, excepting the solemn rush of the waters, and now and then the shrill tinkle of a harp, which, heard from more than a mile&#39;s distance through the midnight silence, announced that some of the Welshmen still protracted their most beloved amusement.
&quot;Men are happy,&quot; she said, &quot;my beloved Rose; their anxious thoughts are either diverted by toilsome exertion, or drowned in the insensibility which follows it.
One hand grasped unconsciously the weapon which she held, and served, at the same time, to prop her forehead, while the tears, by which she was now for the first time relieved, flowed in torrents from her eyes, and her sobs seemed so convulsive, that Rose almost feared her heart was bursting.
Her affection and sympathy dictated at once the kindest course which Eveline&#39;s condition permitted.
Without attempting to control the torrent of grief in its full current, she gently sat her down beside the mourner, and possessing herself of the hand which had sunk motionless by her side, she alternately pressed it to her lips, her bosom, and her brow--now covered it with kisses, now bedewed it with tears, and amid these tokens of the most devoted and humble sympathy, waited a more composed moment to offer her little stock of consolation in such deep silence and stillness, that, as the pale light fell upon the two beautiful young women, it seemed rather to show a group of statuary, the work of some eminent sculptor, than beings whose eyes still wept, and whose hearts still throbbed.
She ventured to kiss her cheek, and throw her arms around Eveline&#39;s neck while she spoke; but a mute caress, which expressed her sense of the faithful girl&#39;s kind intentions to minister if possible to her repose, was the only answer returned.
At length Rose suddenly felt her young mistress shiver in her embrace, and then Eveline&#39;s hand grasped her arm rigidly as she whispered, &quot;Do you hear nothing?&quot;
They found him just alighted from the raven-coloured horse, which was slightly flecked with blood as well as foam, and still panted with the exertions of the evening; though, answering to the caressing hand of its youthful rider, he arched his neck, shook his steel caparison, and snorted to announce his unabated mettle and unwearied love of combat.
The females, who thronged into the court to see the first envoy of their deliverers, could not forbear mixing praises of his beauty with blessings on his valour; and one comely middle-aged dame, in particular, distinguished by the tightness with which her scarlet hose sat on a well-shaped leg and ankle, and by the cleanness of her coif, pressed close up to the young squire, and, more forward than, the rest, doubled the crimson hue of his cheek, by crying aloud, that Our Lady of the Garde Doloureuse had sent them news of their redemption by an angel from the sanctuary;--a speech which, although Father Aldrovand shook his head, was received by her companions with such general acclamation, as greatly embarrassed the young man&#39;s modesty.
while he conducted the noble youth across the court.
&quot;Let my good horse be cared for,&quot; said the cavalier, as he put the bridle into the hand of a menial; and in doing so got rid of some part of his female retinue, who began to pat and praise the steed as much as they had done the rider; and some, in the enthusiasm of their joy, hardly abstained from kissing the stirrups and horse furniture.
replied the incorrigible Gillian; &quot;is your heart so high, because you dandled our young lady on your knee fifteen years since?--Let me tell you, the cat will find its way to the cream, though it was brought up on an abbess&#39;s lap.&quot;
That the spoil thus acquired might not long encumber the soldier, or blunt his ardour for farther enterprise, the usual means of dissipating military spoils were already at hand.
the friend that I have lost!--And I have had anger on his account too--I have seen old Raoul as sour as vinegar, and fit for no place but the kennel for a whole day about it; but, as I said to him, it was not for the like of me, to be affronting our master, and a great baron, about a chuck under the chin, or a kiss, or such like.&quot;
&quot;No wonder, indeed,&quot; replied the dame, with a sigh; &quot;and then what is to become of us?--It is like my young mistress will go to her aunt--or she will marry one of these Lacys that they talk so much of--or, at any rate, she will leave the castle; and it&#39;s like old Raoul and I will be turned to grass with the lord&#39;s old chargers.
&quot;But as to your young lady&#39;s marriage?&quot;
But there is a marriage talked of, that is certain--and most folk think it must be for this smooth-cheeked boy, Damian, as they call him; for though the Constable has gotten a beard, which his nephew hath not, it is something too grizzled for a bridegroom&#39;s chin-- Besides, he goes to the Holy Wars--fittest place for all elderly warriors--I wish he would take Raoul with him.--But what is all this to what you were saying about your mourning wares even now?-- It is a sad truth, that my poor lord is gone--But what then?-- Well-a-day, you know the good old saw,-- &#39;Cloth must be wear, Eat beef and drink beer, Though the dead go to bier.&#39;
And for your merchandising, I am as like to help you with my good word as Mannerly Margery, provided you bid fair for it; since, if the lady loves me not so much, I can turn the steward round my finger.&quot;
If the sentinel be a Fleming, you have but to say you are a merchant, and he will let you in for the love of trade.&quot;
----The funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage table.
Eveline readily acquiesced in what was proposed, as the expedient agreeable to the Constable, and recommended by Damian; but, in the simplicity of her heart, she saw no good reason why, under the guardianship of the latter, she should not instantly, and without farther form, have traversed the little familiar plain on which, when a child, she used to chase butterflies and gather king&#39;s- cups, and where of later years she was wont to exercise her palfrey on this well-known plain, being the only space, and that of small extent, which separated her from the camp of the Constable.
At the hour of noon he arrived, nobly mounted, at the gate of the castle, and drawing up a small body of servants, pages, and equerries, who attended him in their richest liveries, placed himself at their head, and directed his nephew to intimate to the Lady of the Garde Doloureuse, that the humblest of her servants awaited the honour of her presence at the castle gate.
The action and speech, though both in consistence with the romantic gallantry of the times, embarrassed Eveline; and the rather that this homage was so publicly rendered.
&quot;Lady,&quot; said the Constable, after some hesitation, &quot;I would willingly say what it is my lot to tell you, in such terms as ladies love to listen to, and which surely your excellent beauty more especially deserves; but I have been too long trained in camps and councils to express my meaning otherwise than simply and plainly.&quot;
&quot;Your father, noble lady, had this union warmly at heart.
Now all ye ladies of fair Scotland, And ladies of England that happy would prove, Marry never for houses, nor marry for land, Nor marry for nothing but only love.
He is too great to be loved himself--too haughty to love you as you deserve.
&quot;Even this shakes me not,&quot; said Rose; &quot;I will never believe our Lady of Mercy would exact such a penalty for her protection, as to desire me to wed the man I could not love.
Go a pilgrimage barefooted to Rome--do any thing but give your hand where you cannot give your heart.&quot;
Have I not seen a household where love was not--where, although there was worth and good will, and enough of the means of life, all was imbittered by regrets, which were not only vain, but criminal?&quot;
She had a heart like yours, formed to love and be loved; and it would be doing honour to yonder proud Baron, to say he had such worth as my father&#39;s.-- Yet was she most unhappy.
Eveline returned the pressure with which the affectionate girl, as she clung to her hand, enforced her well-meant advice, and then muttered with a profound sigh,--&quot;Rose, it is too late.&quot;
I will tell him he doth no knightly part towards you, to press his contract with your father in such an hour of helpless sorrow--no pious part, in delaying the execution of his vows for the purpose of marrying or giving in marriage--no honest part, to press himself on a maiden whose heart has not decided in his favour--no wise part, to marry one whom he must presently abandon, either to solitude, or to the dangers of a profligate court.&quot;
&quot;You speak too boldly, damsel,&quot; said Eveline; &quot;and, while I acknowledge your affection, it becomes me to check your mode of expression.&quot;
&quot;Nay, take that tone, and I have done,&quot; said Rose.--&quot;To Eveline, whom I love, and who loves me, I can speak freely--but to the Lady of the Garde Doloureuse, the proud Norman damsel, (which when you choose to be you can be,) I can curtsy as low as my station demands, and speak as little truth as she cares to hear.&quot;
So saying, Rose left the apartment, and her young lady looked after her in silence--then murmured to herself--&quot;Rose loves me truly; but she would willingly be more of the mistress than the maiden; and then she is somewhat jealous of every other person that approaches me.--It is strange, that I have not seen Damian de Lacy since my interview with the Constable.
Beside her, on a Spanish jennet, the gift of her affectionate father,--who had procured it at a high rate, and who would have given half his substance to gratify his daughter,--sat the girlish form of Rose Flammock, who had so much of juvenile shyness in her manner, so much of feeling and of judgment in her thoughts and actions.
Thou art going among strangers--forget not the qualities which made thee loved at home.
And now, when as the important steward spurred up his palfrey to kiss his young lady&#39;s hand, and to take his leave, it seemed to the bystanders as if Raoul so managed his bridle and spur, that Mahound jerked out his hoofs at the same moment, one of which coming in contact with the steward&#39;s thigh, would have splintered it like a rotten reed, had the parties been a couple of inches nearer to each other.
Himself no ardent lover, although captivated both by the beauty and the amiable qualities of the fair orphan, De Lacy was satisfied with being endured as a companion, and made no efforts to improve the opportunity which this familiarity afforded him, by recurring to any of the topics of the preceding day.
&quot;She was my grandmother&#39;s sister,&quot; answered Eveline, &quot;a noble Saxon lady; but she disliked the match formed with a Norman house, and never saw her sister after the period of her marriage.&quot;
He recollected also that the castle of Herbert was within two miles of the habitation of the Lady of Baldringham, and that his separation from Eveline was but for one night; yet a sense of the difference betwixt their years, and perhaps of his own deficiency in those lighter qualifications by which the female heart is supposed to be most frequently won, rendered even this temporary absence matter of anxious thought and apprehension; so that, during their afternoon journey, he rode in silence by Eveline&#39;s side, rather meditating what might chance to- morrow, than endeavouring to avail himself of present opportunity.
Here the Constable De Lacy, having charged a part of his men to attend the Lady Eveline to the house of her relation, and to keep watch around it with the utmost vigilance, but at such a distance as might not give offence or inconvenience to the family, kissed her hand, and took a reluctant leave.
&quot;I have heard,&quot; she said, &quot;that my aunt loves the ancient customs so well, that she is loath to admit into her halls any thing younger than the time of Edward the Confessor.&quot;
So saying, she at length arose, and saluted her niece with a kiss on the forehead.
Go to--let the room be made ready--small preparation may serve, if she cherish not the Norman nicety about bed and lodging.
It has been, of late, severely tried; but, since such is your pleasure, and the custom of your house, my heart is yet strong enough to encounter what you propose to subject me to.&quot;
CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH Sometimes, methinks, I hear the groans of ghosts, Then hollow sounds and lamentable screams; Then, like a dying echo from afar, My mother&#39;s voice, that cries, &quot;Wed not, Almeyda-- Forewanvd, Almeyda, marriage is thy crime.&quot;
Her aunt took a solemn leave of her, crossed her forehead, kissed it, and whispered in her ear, &quot;Be courageous, and be fortunate.&quot;
&quot;Thou art too bold, sweetheart,&quot; said the Lady Ermengarde, looking at the Flemish maiden from under her dark brows; &quot;and yet there is wit in thy words.
More she could not see, for Eveline turned on the threshold, and kissing her at the same time, thrust her gently back into the smaller apartment which she had just left, shut the door of communication, and barred and bolted it, as if in security against her well-meant intrusion.
To start up and fly to the door was the work of a moment with the generous girl, who never permitted fear to struggle with love or duty.
In this they at length succeeded, for Eveline fetched a fuller sigh, and opened her eyes; but presently shut them again, and letting her head drop on Rose&#39;s bosom, fell into a strong shuddering fit; while her faithful damsel, chafing her hands and her temples alternately with affectionate assiduity, and mingling caresses with these efforts, exclaimed aloud, &quot;She lives!--She is recovering!--Praised be God!&quot;
No sooner was she gone, than Rose, giving way to the enthusiastic affection which she felt for her mistress, implored her, in the most tender terms, to open her eyes, (for she had again closed them,) and speak to Rose, her own Rose, who was ready, if necessary, to die by her mistress&#39;s side.
&quot;Hear me, both of you,&quot; she said, &quot;and observe my words, as you love and as you fear me.
demanded Eveline in her turn; &quot;or are you disappointed that you find me not a corpse, within the limits of the chamber which your hospitality and affection allotted to me?&quot;
&quot;She of the ruddy finger,&quot; replied Ermengarde, triumphantly, &quot;loves not the blood of the stranger.&quot;
&quot;She had less reason, while she walked the earth, to love that of the Saxon,&quot; said Eveline, &quot;unless her legend speaks false in that matter; and unless, as I well suspect, your house is haunted, not by the soul of the dead who suffered within its walls, but by evil spirits, such as the descendants of Hengist and Horsa are said still in secret to worship.&quot;
Rose announced that her train was in the court, and mounted; when, with a low reverence, Eveline endeavoured to pass her relation, and leave the apartment without farther ceremony.
The Cavaliers came up to join the retinue of Lady Eveline, with armour glittering in the morning rays, trumpets sounding, horses prancing, neighing, and thrown, each by his chivalrous rider, into the attitude best qualified to exhibit the beauty of the steed and dexterity of the horseman; while their lances, streaming with long penoncelles, were brandished in every manner which could display elation of heart and readiness of hand.
Theirs is the noble wrath of the lion, which destroys or is appeased at once--there is no guile in their romantic affection, no sullenness mixed with their generous indignation--they know the duties of the hall as well as those of battle; and were they to be surpassed in the arts of war, (which will only be when Plinlimmon is removed from its base,) they would still remain superior to every other people in generosity and courtesy.&quot;
And I confess, my heart is the lighter, that I can now no longer observe the least vestige of that ancient mansion, in which we passed so unpleasant a night, and the recollection of which will always be odious to me.&quot;
&quot;I know the legend but imperfectly,&quot; replied Eveline, proceeding with a degree of calmness, the result of strong exertion over her mental anxiety, &quot;but in general it runs thus:--Baldrick, the Saxon hero who first possessed yonder dwelling, became enamoured of a fair Briton, said to have been descended from those Druids of whom the Welsh speak so much, and deemed not unacquainted with the arts of sorcery which they practised, when they offered up human sacrifices amid those circles of unhewn and living rock, of which thou hast seen so many.
Some say he doubted her fidelity--some that the matter was pressed on him by the church, as she was suspected of heresy--some that he removed her to make way for a more wealthy marriage--but all agree in the result.
After haunting him in peace and war, in desert, court, and camp, until he died despairingly on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, the Bahr-geist, or ghost of the murdered Vanda, became so terrible in the House of Baldringham, that the succour of Saint Dunstan was itself scarcely sufficient to put bounds to her visitation.
&quot;My grandfather thought so, and never permitted my grandmother to revisit the house of Baldringham after her marriage; hence disunion betwixt him and his son on the one part, and the members of that family on the other.
I cannot judge how long I had slept, when my bosom was oppressed by an unusual weight, which seemed at once to stifle my voice, stop the beating of my heart, and prevent me from drawing my breath; and when I looked up to discover the cause of this horrible suffocation, the form of the murdered British matron stood over my couch taller than life, shadowy, and with a countenance where traits of dignity and beauty were mingled with a fierce expression of vengeful exultation.
She held over me the hand which bore the bloody marks of her husband&#39;s cruelty, and seemed as if she signed the cross, devoting me to destruction; while, with an unearthly tone, she uttered these words:-- `Widow&#39;d wife, and married maid, Betrothed, betrayer, and betray&#39;d!&#39;
Eveline reached her hand out to her friend, and as she pressed affectionately that which Rose gave in return, she whispered to her with energy, &quot;I thank thee for the judgment, which my own heart confirms.&quot;
His wife, Eveline thought, (and she was not without ambition,) if relinquishing some of those qualities in a husband which are in youth most captivating to the female imagination, must be still generally honoured and respected, and have contentment, if not romantic felicity, within her reach.
It was not aversion to the Constable--it was far less preference to any other suitor--it was one of those instinctive movements and emotions by which Nature seems to warn us of approaching danger, though furnishing no information respecting its nature, and suggesting no means of escaping from it.
But, still more zealous for her lady&#39;s honour than even for her happiness, Rose had strictly forborne every effort which could affect Eveline&#39;s purpose, when she had once expressed her approbation of De Lacy&#39;s addresses; and whatever she thought or anticipated concerning the proposed marriage, she seemed from that moment to consider it as an event which must necessarily take place.
Although a nun and a devotee, she held in reverence the holy state of matrimony, and comprehended so much of it as to be aware, that its important purposes could not be accomplished while the whole continent of Europe was interposed betwixt the married pair; for as to a hint from the Constable, that his young spouse might accompany him into the dangerous and dissolute precincts of the Crusader&#39;s camp, the good lady crossed herself with horror at the proposal, and never permitted it to be a second time mentioned in her presence.
The necessity that this point should be previously adjusted, as well as the recent loss of Eveline&#39;s father, gave an air of privacy to De Lacy&#39;s courtship, and prevented its being signalized by tournaments and feats of military skill, in which he would have been otherwise desirous to display his address in the eyes of his mistress.
The rules of the convent prevented his giving entertainments of dancing, music, or other more pacific revels; and although the Constable displayed his affection by the most splendid gifts to his future bride and her attendants, the whole affair, in the opinion of the experienced Dame Gillian, proceeded more with the solemnity of a funeral, than the light pace of an approaching bridal.
The bride herself felt something of this, and thought occasionally it might have been lightened by the visits of young Damian, in whose age, so nearly corresponding to her own, she might have expected some relief from the formal courtship of his graver uncle.
This engagement, which preceded the actual marriage for a space more or less, according to circumstances, was usually celebrated with a solemnity corresponding to the rank of the contracting parties.
And yet my name once stood as high in fields and courts, as that of the Constable; nor is it aught more disgraceful than what is indeed often esteemed the worst of disgraces--poverty, which prevents my still aspiring to places of honour and fame.
&quot;If he has been ruined only through follies, he is now of an age when these are no longer tempting snares; and if his heart and hand be good, he may yet be an honour to the House of De Lacy.&quot;
&quot;He hath indeed,&quot; he said, &quot;a heart and hand fit for service, God knoweth, whether in good or evil.
The outer court of the convent was indeed for the time opened for the reception of the male sex; but the younger sisters and novices of the house being carefully secluded in the more inner apartments of the extensive building, under the immediate eye of a grim old nun, or, as the conventual rule designed her, an ancient, sad, and virtuous person, termed Mistress of the Novices, were not permitted to pollute their eyes by looking on waving plumes and rustling mantles.
A stout band of the Constable&#39;s spearmen guarded the gate of the nunnery, admitting within the hallowed precinct the few only who were to be present at the solemnity, with their principal attendants, and while the former were ushered with all due ceremony into the apartments dressed out for the occasion, the attendants, although detained in the outer court, were liberally supplied with refreshments of the most substantial kind; and had the amusement, so dear to the menial classes, of examining and criticising their masters and mistresses, as they passed into the interior apartments prepared for their reception.
The pair had stuck themselves into a kind of niche, three or four steps from the ground, which contained a small stone bench, whence their curious eyes could scrutinize with advantage every guest who entered the court.
&quot;Is not this better than laying your dog-leash on your loving wife, as if she were a brach of the kennel?&quot;
Raoul turned briskly round as if a wasp had stung him, and there is no guessing what his reply might have been to this seemingly innocent observation, had not a gallant horseman at that instant entered the court, and, dismounting like the others, gave his horse to the charge of a squire, or equerry, whose attire blazed with embroidery.
&quot;Surely of your nephew&#39;s love and regard to your lordship,&quot; answered Randal, &quot;which, not to mention his respect for the lady Eveline, must have compelled him hither, if his limbs were able to bear him.--And here the bride comes, I think, in charity, to thank him for his zeal.&quot;
The subscription of the contract of marriage had, as already noticed, been just concluded, when the company assembled on the occasion were interrupted by the news of Damian&#39;s illness.
With a heart even still more softened towards his kinsman&#39;s sufferings from hearing the points on which his mind wandered, the Constable twice applied his hand to the latch of the door, in order to enter the bedroom, and twice forebore, his eyes running faster with tears than he chose should be witnessed by the attendants.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;It skills not now, my lord, to say what the brave Constable of Chester has been to the poor priest Baldwin, or with what love and pride we beheld him assume the holy sign of salvation, and, to honour Him by whom he has himself been raised to honour, vow himself to the deliverance of the Holy Land.
To meaner men we might have granted the privilege of marrying and giving in marriage, even although they care not for the sorrows of Jacob; but you, my lord, are a main prop of our enterprise, and, being withdrawn, the whole fabric may fall to the ground.
he died when we were in unkindness with each other.--My lord, your words import that my beloved nephew suffers pain and incurs danger on account of my offences?&quot;
&quot;And now, noble De Lacy,&quot; said the Prelate, &quot;once more my best beloved and most honoured friend--is not thy bosom lighter since thou hast thus nobly acquitted thee of thy debt to Heaven, and cleansed thy gallant spirit from those selfish and earthly stains which dimmed its brightness?&quot;
His hair was cut in imitation of the clerical tonsure, which was designed to intimate that he had arrived to a certain rank in his profession; for the Joyous Science, as the profession of minstrelsy was termed, had its various ranks, like the degrees in the church and in chivalry.
I would be willing to contend with him in romance, lay, or fable, were the judge to be King Henry himself.&quot;
&quot;He that is young enough to seek for, and to win, the love of beauty,&quot; said the minstrel, but in a submissive tone, as if fearing his freedom might give offence, &quot;should not term himself too old to feel the charms of minstrelsy.&quot;
&quot;It may be so,&quot; said De Lacy, somewhat ashamed at having shown himself moved by the sudden and lively action of the juggler; &quot;but I love not jesting with edge-tools, and have too much to do with sword and sword-blows in earnest, to toy with them; so I pray you let us have no more of this, but call me my squire and my chamberlain, for I am about to array me and go to mass.&quot;
The religious duties of the morning performed, it was the Constable&#39;s intention to visit the Lady Abbess, and communicate, with the necessary precautions and qualifications, the altered relations in which he was placed towards her niece, by the resolution he had been compelled to adopt, of departing for the Crusade before accomplishing his marriage, in the terms of the precontract already entered into.
The Abbess, it is true, remained silent for a moment after his arguments had been exhausted, but it was only to consider how she should intimate in a suitable and reverent manner, that children, the usual attendants of a happy union, and the existence of which she looked to for the continuation of the house of her father and brother, could not be hoped for with any probability, unless the precontract was followed by marriage, and the residence of the married parties in the same country.
She received the communication with sullen dignity; her ample black robe and scapular seeming, as it were, to swell out in yet prouder folds as she listened to the reasons and the emergencies which compelled the Constable of Chester to defer the marriage which he avowed was the dearest wish of his heart, until after his return from the Crusade, for which he was about to set forth.
&quot;At least, then,&quot; said the Abbess, veiling her resentment under the appearance of extreme coldness, &quot;your lordship will do us the justice to place us in the same situation in which we stood yesterday morning; and, by joining with my niece and her friends in desiring the abrogation of a marriage contract, entered into with very different views from those which you now entertain, put a young person in that state of liberty of which she is at present deprived by her contract with you.&quot;
And so well were these opposing qualities of timidity and resolution mingled on her cheek, that Eveline, in the utmost pride of her beauty, never looked more fascinating than at that instant; and Hugo de Lacy, hitherto rather an unimpassioned lover, stood in her presence with feelings as if all the exaggerations of romance were realized, and his mistress were a being of a higher sphere, from whose doom he was to receive happiness or misery, life or death.
said Eveline, with more animation than she had yet expressed; and it appeared that the tone was at length sufficiently encouraging, since her lover was emboldened to take the lips themselves for guarantee.
I have been already censured by my superior because I have, for love of you, fair niece, mixed more deeply in secular affairs than became the head of a convent of recluses--I will merit no farther blame on such an account; nor can you expect it of me.
The grave tenor of our devotions, and the serener contemplation to which the females of this house are devoted,&quot; continued the Abbess, with increasing heat and vehemence, &quot;shall not, for the sake of my worldly connections, be disturbed by the intrusion of one whose thoughts must needs be on the worldly toys of love and marriage.&quot;
&quot;And yet, my dearest lady,&quot; said Rose, &quot;if you will speak unfeignedly, you must, I am convinced, allow that you look upon this interval of years, interposed betwixt your contract and your marriage, rather as a respite than in any other light.&quot;
I have strain&#39;d the spider&#39;s thread &#39;Gainst the promise of a maid; I have weigh&#39;d a grain of sand &#39;Gainst her plight of heart and hand; I told my true love of the token, How her faith proved light, and her word was broken Again her word and truth she plight, And I believed them again ere night.&quot;
De Lacy made a sign of acquiescence, and laid himself as if to slumber; while Vidal began one of those interminable and almost innumerable adventures concerning that paragon of true lovers, fair Ysolte; and of the constant and uninterrupted faith and affection which she displayed in numerous situations of difficulty and peril, to her paramour, the gallant Sir Tristrem, at the expense of her less favoured husband, the luckless King Mark of Cornwall; to whom, as all the world knows, Sir Tristrem was nephew.
This was not the lay of love and fidelity which De Lacy would have chosen; but a feeling like shame prevented his interrupting it, perhaps because he was unwilling to yield to or acknowledge the unpleasing sensations excited by the tenor of the tale.
Were I to choose some knight of name, as I have many in my household, he would be setting about to do deeds of vassalage upon the Welsh, and engaging himself in turmoils, which would render the safety of the castle precarious; or he would be absent on feats of chivalry, tournaments, and hunting parties; or he would, perchance, have shows of that light nature under the walls, or even within the courts of the castle, turning the secluded and quiet abode, which becomes the situation of the Lady Eveline, into the misrule of a dissolute revel.--Thee I can confide in--thou wilt fight when it is requisite, yet wilt not provoke danger for the sake of danger itself--thy birth, thy habits, will lead thee to avoid those gaieties, which, however fascinating to others, cannot but be distasteful to thee--thy management will be as regular, as I will take care that it shall be honourable; and thy relation to her favourite, Rose, will render thy guardianship more agreeable to the Lady Eveline, than, perchance, one of her own rank--And, to speak to thee a language which, thy nation readily comprehends, the reward, Fleming, for the regular discharge of this most weighty trust, shall be beyond thy most flattering hope.&quot;
Think her shut up in yonder solitary castle, under such respectable protection, and reflect how long the place will be solitary in this land of love and of adventure!
&quot;And be besieged in form,&quot; said the Fleming, &quot;like the Castle of Tintadgel in the old hangings, all for the love of fair lady?--And then those gay dames and demoiselles, who go upon adventure from castle to castle, from tournament to tournament, with bare bosoms, flaunting plumes, poniards at their sides, and javelins in their hands, chattering like magpies, and fluttering like jays, and, ever and anon, cooing like doves--how am I to exclude such from the Lady Eveline&#39;s privacy?&quot;
You only can claim her cheerful love and ready obedience; and sure I am, that, without pretending to guess what she may do if separated from you, she will, under your own eye, do the duty of a faithful and a loving spouse.&quot;
said the Constable, with a sigh, his heart confessing the wisdom of the advice, which circumstances prevented him from following.
&quot;Nay, I mean another,&quot; said Flammock, &quot;nearer to you by blood, and, unless I greatly mistake, much nigher also in affection--I had in mind your lordship&#39;s nephew, Damian de Lacy.&quot;
CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SECOND The Virgin&#39;s image falls--yet some, I ween, Not unforgiven the suppliant knee might bend, As to a visible power, in which might blend All that was mix&#39;d, and reconciled in her, Of mother&#39;s love, with maiden&#39;s purity, Of high with low, celestial with terrene.
The household of the Lady Eveline, though of an establishment becoming her present and future rank, was of a solemn and sequestered character, corresponding to her place of residence, and the privacy connected with her situation, retired as she was from the class of maidens who are yet unengaged, and yet not united with that of matrons, who enjoy the protection of a married name.
Sometimes, but rarely, Rose obtained permission for a strolling minstrel to entertain an hour with his ditty of love and chivalry; sometimes a pilgrim from a distant shrine, repaid by long tales of the wonders which he had seen in other lands, the hospitality which the Garde Doloureuse afforded; and sometimes also it happened, that the interest and intercession of the tiring-woman obtained admission for travelling merchants, or pedlars, who, at the risk of their lives, found profit by carrying from castle to castle the materials of rich dresses and female ornaments.
A strolling minstrel, who sought the Garde Doloureuse, had recited, for the amusement of the lady and household, the celebrated lay of the Count of Gleichen, who, already married in his own country, laid himself under so many obligations in the East to a Saracen princess, through whose means he achieved his freedom, that he married her also.
Old Margery, with the tender- heartedness of an ancient nurse, wept bitterly for pity during the tale, and, never questioning either the power of the Pope or the propriety of his decision, was pleased that a mode of extrication was found for a complication of love distresses which seemed almost inextricable.
&quot;Thou art partly right, Rose,&quot; said Eveline; &quot;and methinks the European lady, when she found herself outshone by the young and beautiful foreign princess, would have best consulted her own dignity in resigning the place, and giving the Holy Father no more trouble than in annulling the marriage, as has been done in cases of more frequent occurrence.&quot;
The remark by which Rose had vindicated the distance observed by her youthful guardian, sometimes arose to her recollection; and while her soul repelled with scorn the suspicion, that, in any case, his presence, whether at intervals or constantly, could be prejudicial to his uncle&#39;s interest, she conjured up various arguments for giving him a frequent place in her memory.--Was it not her duty to think of Damian often and kindly, as the Constable&#39;s nearest, best beloved, and most trusted relative?--Was he not her former deliverer and her present guardian?--And might he not be considered as an instrument specially employed by her divine patroness, in rendering effectual the protection with which she had graced her in more than one emergency?
While in these unpleasing meditations, he was surprised by the voice of his beloved Dame Gillian, who seldom was an early riser, and yet more rarely visited him when he was in his sphere of peculiar authority.
And he came to thy chamber, doubtless, because he could not have as easily come hither to me himself.--Was it not so, sweetheart?&quot;
&quot;My lady used to love the sport well enough,&quot; said Raoul; &quot;but, I wot not why, she is moped and mazed ever since her father&#39;s death, and lives in her fair castle like a nun in a cloister, without disport or revelry of any kind.
Nevertheless, Gillian, thou canst do something with her-- good now, do a kind deed for once, and move her to come out and look on this morning&#39;s sport--the poor heart hath seen no pastime this summer.&quot;
&quot;It is impossible!--I watched her green mantle --I watched her plumy bonnet as I saw her hurried from the field, and felt my own inability to follow to the rescue; nor did force or exertion altogether leave me till the waving of the robe and the dancing of the feathers were lost to my eyes, and all hope of rescuing her abandoned my heart.&quot;
noble Damian,&quot; said Eveline, &quot;break not my heart by blaming yourself for an imprudence which is altogether my own.
Being surrounded by hills and woods, it was a celebrated spot for finding game, and, in former days, a Welsh prince, renowned for his universal hospitality, his love of _crw_ and of the chase, had erected a forest-lodge, where he used to feast his friends and followers with a profusion unexampled in Cambria.
The subject of their praises, however, fell finally a victim to his propensities, having been stabbed to the heart in one of those scenes of confusion and drunkenness which were frequently the conclusion of his renowned banquets.
Rose, by nature one of the most disinterested and affectionate maidens that ever breathed, was the first who, hastily considering the peculiar condition in which her lady was placed, and the marked degree of restraint which had hitherto characterized her intercourse with her youthful guardian, became anxious to know how the wounded knight was to be disposed of; and when she came to Eveline&#39;s side for the purpose of asking this important question, her resolution well-nigh failed her.
Bethink you we are under this lady&#39;s banner, and that she has been my loving mistress, and her father was your good lord; to the Constable, too, are you beholden, for enlarged privileges.
&quot;There are many among the Norman men-at-arms who talk, over their wine-cups, how that Damian de Lacy is in love with his uncle&#39;s betrothed bride; ay, and that they correspond together by art magic.&quot;
Oh, make me strong where I am most weak--Let not my gratitude and my compassion be a snare to me; and while I strive to discharge the duties which thankfulness imposes on me, save me from the evil tongues of men--and save--oh, save me from the insidious devices of my own heart!&quot;
Get thee straightway to horse, and join to thy own men as many as thou canst gather of mine--Go--ride, my brave youth--show thy master&#39;s banner, and let them see that his forces and his heart are with them, though his person be absent.
When they are young, they bribe us with fair looks, and sugared words, sweet kisses and love tokens; and when they are of middle age, they work us to their will by presents and courtesies, red wine and red gold; and when they are old, we are fain to run their errands to get out of sight of their old leathern visages.
&quot;With all my heart,&quot; answered Amelot; &quot;and I will send out an advanced party upon the adventure, as thou hast advised me.&quot;
&quot;And now that we are on the old terms, Sir Page,&quot; said the banner-man, &quot;tell me, if thou canst, doth not yonder fair lady love our handsome knight _par amours?_&quot; &quot;It is a false calumny,&quot; said Amelot, indignantly; &quot;betrothed as she is to his uncle, I am convinced she would rather die than have such a thought, and so would our master.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;We are in time, we are in time,&quot; said Amelot, dropping the reins of his bridle, and joyfully clapping his hands; &quot;shake thy banner abroad, Genvil--give Wenlock and his fellows a fair view of it.-- Comrades, halt--breathe your horses for a moment.--Hark hither, Genvil--If we descend by yonder broad pathway into the meadow where the cattle are--&quot; &quot;Bravo, my young falcon&quot; replied Genvil, whose love of battle, like that of the war-horse of Job, kindled at the sight of the spears, and at the sound of the trumpet; &quot;we shall have then an easy field for a charge on yonder knaves.&quot;
He was introduced to her accordingly, and, with a heavy heart, mentioned the ineffectual event of his expedition.
&quot;All that you have said, fair lady,&quot; he replied, &quot;had been enough, if told by another, to have broken my heart; for it tells me that the power and honour of my house, so solemnly committed to my charge, have been blasted in my misfortunes.
The defenders of the castle looked on each other with blank and dejected countenances, while Monthermer, raising aloft his lance, exclaimed, as he turned his horse from the castle gate, &quot;When I next approach the Garde Doloureuse, it will be not merely to intimate, but to execute, the mandate of my Sovereign.&quot;
Along a wasted tract of country, more than twelve miles distant from the Garde Doloureuse, in the heat of a summer noon, which shed a burning lustre on the silent valley, and the blackened ruins of the cottages with which it had been once graced, two travellers walked slowly, whose palmer cloaks, pilgrims&#39; staves, large slouched hats, with a scallop shell bound on the front of each, above all, the cross, cut in red cloth upon their shoulders, marked them as pilgrims who had accomplished their vow, and had returned from that fatal bourne, from which, in those days, returned so few of the thousands who visited it, whether in the love of enterprise, or in the ardour of devotion.
But I speak not more on the subject; only I am an old mastiff, of the true breed--I love my master, but cannot endure some of those whom he favours; and yonder, as I judge, comes Vidal, to give us such an account of our situation as it shall please him.&quot;
Although Hugo de Lacy rendered this attendant no more than what in justice he supposed his services demanded, when he vindicated him from the suspicions thrown out by Guarine, yet at the bottom of his heart he had sometimes shared those suspicions, and was often angry at himself, as a just and honest man, for censuring, on the slight testimony of looks, and sometimes casual expressions, a fidelity which seemed to be proved by many acts of zeal and integrity.
&quot;Eveline Berenger is then married,&quot; said the Constable; &quot;and, let me make a wild guess,--she has not abandoned the family, though she has forsaken the individual--she is still a Lacy?
She is married to Damian de Lacy--to my nephew?&quot;
&quot;No, my lord--not married,&quot; answered the minstrel, with an emphasis on the word, which the Constable knew how to interpret.
&quot;No, no,&quot; he replied quickly, &quot;not married, perhaps, but engaged- troth-plighted.
Calm and collected did the minstrel reply,--&quot;The Lady Eveline and Sir Damian are neither married nor affianced, my lord.
They have loved and lived together--_par amours_.&quot;
exclaimed the Constable, turning hastily to his squire: &quot;He tells me of my disgrace--of the dishonour of my house--of the depravity of those whom I have loved the best in the world--he tells me of it with a calm look, an eye composed, an unfaltering tongue.--Is this--can it be natural?
He had, in fact, only addressed him in that sort of fulness of heart, which would have vented itself in soliloquy if alone, and now poured itself out on the nearest auditor, without the speaker being entirely conscious of the sentiments which his speech excited.
&quot;Have you no care of it--Because you love _par amours_, is it reasonable you should throw away your life and ours?&quot;
&quot;Thy intentions,&quot; he said, &quot;shall not be forgotten, good fellow, though they have been anticipated by the headlong valour of my son Richard, which has cost some poor caitiffs their lives--Richard loves not to sheathe a bloodless weapon.
The conclusion of the last chapter contains the tidings with which the minstrel greeted his unhappy master, Hugo de Lacy; not indeed with the same detail of circumstances with which we have been able to invest the narrative, but so as to infer the general and appalling facts, that his betrothed bride, and beloved and trusted kinsman, had leagued together for his dishonour--had raised the banner of rebellion against their lawful sovereign, and, failing in their audacious attempt, had brought the life of one of them, at least, into the most imminent danger, and the fortunes of the House of Lacy, unless some instant remedy could be found, to the very verge of ruin.
&quot;Think, my lord,&quot; said Vidal, &quot;all is lost--love, dominion, high office, and bright fame--so late a chief among nobles, now a poor palmer!&quot;
&quot;It will bring our hand in use though,&quot; said Gillian; and commenced, in a whining tone, &quot;God love you, holy men, who have had the grace to go to the Holy Land, and, what is more, have had the grace to come back again; I pray, bestow some of your alms upon my poor old husband, who is a miserable object, as you see, and upon one who has the bad luck to be his wife--Heaven help me!&quot;
&quot;I humbly thank your goodness,&quot; said she, as, (having first kissed her,) the squire set her on the ground.
&quot;Is it because he seduced my simplicity to let him into the castle of the Garde Doloureuse-ay, oftener than once or twice either,-when he was disguised as a pedlar, and told him all the secrets of the family, and how the boy Damian, and the girl Eveline, were dying of love with each other, but had not courage to say a word of it, for fear of the Constable, though he were a thousand miles off?-You seem concerned, worthy sir--may I offer your reverend worship a trifling sup from my bottle, which is sovereign for _tremor cordis_, and fits of the spleen?&quot;
&quot;Thou say&#39;st,&quot; at length exclaimed the Constable, &quot;that Damian de Lacy and Eveline love each other, yet are unconscious of guilt or falsehood, or ingratitude to me--I would say, to their relative in Palestine!&quot;
&quot;Love, sir!--in troth and so it is--they do love each other,&quot; said Gillian; &quot;but it is like angels--or like lambs--or like fools, if you will; for they would never so much as have spoken together, but for a prank of that same Randal Lacy&#39;s.&quot;
The dislike, indeed, was chiefly upon Guarine&#39;s side; for nothing could be more indifferent to Renault Vidal than was his companion, farther than as he was conscious that Philip loved him not, and was not unlikely, so far as lay in his power, to thwart some plans which he had nearly at heart.
But he had probably something at his heart which affected his throat or appetite.
&quot;Thou may&#39;st earn a fair largess, for our Norman masters love _jonglerie_.&quot;
You rejected it with scorn--and yet notwithstanding that insult, it required that I should have seen you, as I thought, trampling over the field in which you slew my master, in the full pride of Norman insolence, to animate my resolution to strike the blow, which, meant for you, has slain at least one of your usurping race.--I will answer no more questions--lead on to axe or gallows--it is indifferent to Cadwallon--my soul will soon be with my free and noble ancestry, and with my beloved and royal patron.&quot;
Yet that was severe enough; for maiden aunts, whether abbesses or no, are not tolerant of the species of errors of which Eveline was accused; and the innocent damosel was brought in many ways to eat her bread in shame of countenance and bitterness of heart.
The Abbess, who loved her niece, although her affection showed itself often in a vexatious manner, became at length alarmed-- countermanded her orders for removing Eveline to an inferior cell-- attended herself to see her laid in bed, (in which, as in every thing else, the young lady seemed entirely passive,) and, with something like reviving tenderness, kissed and blessed her on leaving the apartment.
She bent down, as if to kiss Eveline, who started at that instant, and then awoke.
The blue eyes and fair hair of a lovely female face, with half-veiled bosom and dishevelled locks, flitted through her vision, and indeed its lips approached to those of the lovely sleeper at the moment of her awakening; but it was Rose in whose arms her mistress found herself pressed, and who moistened her face with tears, as in a passion of affection she covered it with kisses.
A coffin--and his own arms and initials were painted upon it--stood in one corner, to remind him of his approaching fate; and a crucifix was placed in another, to intimate to him that there was a world beyond that which must soon close upon him.
He demanded a confessor, and the jailer, though he withdrew without reply, seemed to intimate by his manner that the boon would be granted.
&quot;Now may I indeed call myself unhappy,&quot; said Damian, &quot;that I cannot show my love and duty to my noble uncle, who hath ever been a father to me in my orphan state.&quot;
&quot;It will be a heavy disappointment, doubtless, to the Constable,&quot; said the Palmer, &quot;because he was eager to return to this happy country, to fulfil a contract of marriage which he had formed with a lady of great beauty and fortune.&quot;
&quot;Then, death of thy heart, slave,&quot; said Damian, impatiently, &quot;why hang these fetters on the free limbs of a Norman noble?
Peevishness and jealousy have possessed themselves of a heart which was once strong and generous; his life is now on the dregs, and I grieve to speak it, these dregs are foul and bitter.&quot;
&quot;That men grow old, I know; and if with infirmity of body comes infirmity of temper and mind, their case the more strongly claims the dutiful observance of those who are bound to them in blood or affection.&quot;
&quot;Ay,&quot; replied the Pilgrim, &quot;but the Constable&#39;s mind has been poisoned against thee by rumours which have reached his ear from England, that there have been thoughts of affection betwixt thee and his betrothed bride, Eveline Berenger.--Ha!
Were he once in my prison-house,&#39; your uncle continued to speak of you, &#39;he should rot and die ere I sent one penny of ransom to set at liberty the lover of my betrothed bride.&#39;&quot;
He raised him with much kindness, kissed his cheek, and proceeded; &quot;Think not, my dearest nephew, that I meant in my late disguise to try your faith, which I myself never doubted.
Marry, I wish though, thy last hug had not been so severe a one.
&quot;Have we not wrestled a turn before now?--But there remains yet one trial for thee to go through--Get thee out of this hole speedily--don thy best array to accompany me to the Church at noon; for, Damian, thou must be present at the marriage of the Lady Eveline Berenger.&quot;

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The Europeans by Henry James CONTENTS CHAPTER I CHAPTER II CHAPTER III CHAPTER IV CHAPTER V CHAPTER VI CHAPTER VII CHAPTER VIII CHAPTER IX CHAPTER X CHAPTER XI CHAPTER XII CHAPTER I A narrow grave-yard in the heart of a bustling, indifferent city, seen from the windows of a gloomy-looking inn, is at no time an object of enlivening suggestion; and the spectacle is not at its best when the mouldy tombstones and funereal umbrage have received the ineffectual refreshment of a dull, moist snow-fall.
“If a woman were to ask you to marry her you would say, ‘Certainly, my dear, with pleasure!’ And you would marry her and be ridiculously happy.
“What do you suppose is the attraction?” “I suppose there is a very good-looking man inside,” said the young man.
I adore you, dear sister!
_Tu vas voir_.” And he bent forward and kissed his sister.
“I feel an intimate conviction that our cousins are like that,” said Felix.
You said that it was the prompting of natural affection; and when I suggested some reasons against it you declared that the _voix du sang_ should go before everything.” “You remember all that?” asked the Baroness.
Tell my story in the way that seems to you most—natural.” And she bent her forehead for him to kiss.
Then she said, “Well, perhaps it’s not of much use.” Charlotte looked at her a little, and then kissed her.
There, for a quarter of an hour, she read the history of the loves of the Prince Camaralzaman and the Princess Badoura.
My mother was his half sister, and older than he.” “Yes,” said Gertrude, “and she turned Roman Catholic and married in Europe.” “I see you know,” said the young man.
“She married and she died.
“She sends you her love; she sent me to announce her.
“She is married to a German prince—Prince Adolf, of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein.
“That’s what they call a marriage, you know, contracted between a scion of a ruling house and—and a common mortal.
Now they want to dissolve the marriage.
Just now everything is _en l’air_.” The cheerful, off-hand tone in which her visitor related this darkly romantic tale seemed to Gertrude very strange; but it seemed also to convey a certain flattery to herself, a recognition of her wisdom and dignity.
“They want to dissolve her marriage?” she asked.
You are in love with Gertrude.
The idea that his niece should be a German Baroness, married “morganatically” to a Prince, had already given him much to think about.
But Charlotte kissed her and took her hand, looking at her sweetly and solemnly.
When she kissed the Baroness she had tears in her eyes.
“You didn’t know, then, the impression made upon this susceptible heart of mine.” She wondered whether he meant the impression her cousin Lizzie had made.
Eugenia kissed her, as she had kissed the other young women, and then held her off a little, looking at her.
Eugenia was a woman of sudden emotions, and now, unexpectedly, she felt one rising in her heart.
The Wentworth household seemed to her very perfect in its kind—wonderfully peaceful and unspotted; pervaded by a sort of dove-colored freshness that had all the quietude and benevolence of what she deemed to be Quakerism, and yet seemed to be founded upon a degree of material abundance for which, in certain matters of detail, one might have looked in vain at the frugal little court of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein.
But what Charlotte mistook for an almost culpably delayed subsidence Gertrude very presently perceived to be the most ingenious, the most interesting, the most romantic intention.
Felix was positively amused at having a house of his own; for the little white cottage among the apple trees—the chalet, as Madame Münster always called it—was much more sensibly his own than any domiciliary _quatrième_, looking upon a court, with the rent overdue.
Felix had spent a good deal of his life in looking into courts, with a perhaps slightly tattered pair of elbows resting upon the ledge of a high-perched window, and the thin smoke of a cigarette rising into an atmosphere in which street-cries died away and the vibration of chimes from ancient belfries became sensible.
It seemed to him that he was in love, indiscriminately, with three girls at once.
The little house in the orchard had hitherto been occupied during the summer months by intimate friends of the family, or by poor relations who found in Mr. Wentworth a landlord attentive to repairs and oblivious of quarter-day.
I have set my heart upon that.
His sister was a figure of his early years; she had been only twenty when she went abroad, never to return, making in foreign parts a willful and undesirable marriage.
They seemed to her a romantic and mysterious class, whose life was made up of those agreeable accidents that never happened to other persons.
While this periodical recital was going on, Gertrude lived in a fantastic world; she seemed to herself to be reading a romance that came out in daily numbers.
“I love you, Gertrude,” he said.
“I love you very much; I love you more than ever.” He said the words just as she had known he would; she had heard them before.
I have known you a long time, and I have loved you as you were.” “I am much obliged to you,” said Gertrude.
He was perfectly willing to get married.
He is always roaming about the fields and sketching old barns, or taking ten-mile walks, or painting someone’s portrait, or rowing on the pond, or flirting with Gertrude Wentworth.” “I should think it would amuse you to go and see a few people,” said Acton.
It was not to be imagined that she should have a flirtation with Clifford, who was a mere shame-faced boy, and whom a large section of Boston society supposed to be “engaged” to Lizzie Acton.
Not, indeed, that it was to be conceived that the Baroness was a possible party to any flirtation whatever; for she was undoubtedly a married lady.
“I should think you would want to know about my marriage; it must seem to you very strange.” Acton looked at her a moment.
“But I should like very much to hear about your marriage.
Now tell me how it came about.” “The Prince fell in love with me,” replied the Baroness simply.
At first he didn’t wish me to marry him; on the contrary.
“And now he wants to break it off?” “They want him to make a political marriage.
Silberstadt is a perfectly despotic little state, and the Reigning Prince may annul the marriage by a stroke of his pen.
If there had been anyone to say it to she would have declared that she was positively in love with her host; but she could hardly make this declaration—even in the strictest confidence—to Acton himself.
I am afraid it must be confessed that he was a decidedly flattering painter, and that he imparted to his models a romantic grace which seemed easily and cheaply acquired by the payment of a hundred dollars to a young man who made “sitting” so entertaining.
For Felix was paid for his pictures, making, as he did, no secret of the fact that in guiding his steps to the Western world affectionate curiosity had gone hand in hand with a desire to better his condition.
He had been in love with duchesses and countesses, and he had made, once or twice, a perilously near approach to cynicism in declaring that the disinterestedness of women had been overrated.
On the whole, he had tempered audacity with modesty; and it is but fair to him now to say explicitly that he would have been incapable of taking advantage of his present large allowance of familiarity to make love to the younger of his handsome cousins.
“I think that if you marry,” said Mr. Wentworth presently, “it will conduce to your happiness.” _“Sicurissimo!”_ Felix exclaimed; and then, arresting his brush, he looked at his uncle with a smile.
“It is very peculiar, as I suppose you have guessed.” “Ah, you mean his love affair with his cousin?” Mr. Wentworth stared, blushing a little.
“Do you mean to marry him to his cousin?” he asked at last.
“I shouldn’t think his cousin would want to marry him.” “You have no understanding, then, with Mrs. Acton?” Mr. Wentworth stared, almost blankly.
Lizzie Acton, then, would not be jealous of another woman.” “I certainly hope not,” said the old man, with a vague sense of jealousy being an even lower vice than a love of liquor.
If he could fall in love with her a little, so much the better.
The suggestion will come best from you.” “Do I understand,” asked the old man, “that I am to suggest to my son to make a—a profession of—of affection to Madame Münster?” “Yes, yes—a profession!” cried Felix sympathetically.
“But, as I understand it, Madame Münster is a married woman.” “Ah,” said Felix, smiling, “of course she can’t marry him.
Felix was very fond of the little lake which occupied so many of Mr. Wentworth’s numerous acres, and of a remarkable pine grove which lay upon the further side of it, planted upon a steep embankment and haunted by the summer breeze.
Even if he makes love to you it is no great matter.” “I am to offer myself as a superior form of intoxication—a substitute for a brandy bottle, eh?” asked the Baroness.
The place was delightfully cool, and had the added charm that—in the softly sounding pine boughs—you seemed to hear the coolness as well as feel it.
I don’t know how to write.” Gertrude, for some time, said nothing more; and her companion, as he looked at her, wished it had not been “disloyal” to make love to the daughter of an old gentleman who had offered one hospitality.
“She is _not_ in love with him,” she said; it seemed her duty to say that.
“Then he is in love with her; or if he is not, he ought to be.
“She wants him to marry me,” she said.
“To marry you!
I wished simply to explain to you about Charlotte.” “You don’t wish to marry Mr.
“And does your father wish it?” “Very much.” “And you don’t like him—you have refused him?” “I don’t wish to marry him.” “Your father and sister think you ought to, eh?” “It is a long story,” said Gertrude.
“I shall never marry Mr. Brand,” she said.
If it were settled that you were to marry Mr.
I have no right to make love to you myself, eh?” And he paused, lightly pressing his argument upon her.
I should make violent love to you,” he added, laughing, “if I thought you were so placed as not to be offended by it.” “You mean if I were engaged to another man?
It moved her greatly, however, to hear Felix say that he was sure of something; so that, raising her eyes toward him, she tried intently, for some moments, to conjure up this wonderful image of a love-affair between her own sister and her own suitor.
ah, Felix!” “Why shouldn’t they marry?
Try and make them marry!” cried Felix.
I will help you as far as I can.” Gertrude’s heart began to beat; she was greatly excited; she had never had anything so interesting proposed to her before.
“Of course she does, and we will marry them off.
“To see my sister married to so good a man.” Felix gave his light laugh.
After that, when I make love to you, you will have to think I mean it.” “I shall never think you mean anything,” said Gertrude.
Gertrude, I adore you!” CHAPTER VIII Charlotte and Mr.
“It makes me feel gloomy.” Mr. Wentworth glanced at his son, and taking note of these words, wondered if Felix had been teaching him, according to the programme he had sketched out, to make love to the wife of a German prince.
There was a kind of rage in her heart; she felt as if she could easily persuade herself that she was persecuted.
Brand would marry Charlotte.
Charlotte,” she added suddenly, “you are in love with him!” “Oh, Gertrude!” cried poor Charlotte; and her sister saw her blushing in the darkness.
“I wish he would marry you!” she went on.
“I wish he would marry you.” “Please don’t say that.” “I mean to tell him so!” said Gertrude.
I will say, ‘Why don’t you marry Charlotte?
He thought of himself in the future as the well-known and much-liked Mr. Wentworth, of Boston, who should, in the natural course of prosperity, have married his pretty cousin, Lizzie Acton; should live in a wide-fronted house, in view of the Common; and should drive, behind a light wagon, over the damp autumn roads, a pair of beautifully matched sorrel horses.
He had not yet asked his cousin to marry him; but he meant to do so as soon as he had taken his degree.
They took the boy’s misdemeanors too much to heart; they talked to him too solemnly; they frightened and bewildered him.
His ideas about her marriage had a good deal of vagueness; but they were in so far definite as that he felt it to be a matter not to be freely mentioned.
He sat and looked all round the room; he supposed she was alluding in some way to her marriage.
I dare say you think that, owing to my irregular marriage, I live with loose people.
“But remember,” she said on this occasion, “that you are coming—next year—to pay me a visit over there.” About a week afterwards she said to him, point-blank, “Are you seriously making love to your little cousin?” “Seriously making love”—these words, on Madame Münster’s lips, had to Clifford’s sense a portentous and embarrassing sound; he hesitated about assenting, lest he should commit himself to more than he understood.
You will be talked about, of course, with me; it will be said you are my lover.
If one is arranging a marriage, one tells one’s friends.” “Oh, I’m not arranging anything,” said Clifford.
“You don’t intend to marry your cousin?” “Well, I expect I shall do as I choose!” The Baroness leaned her head upon the back of her chair and closed her eyes, as if she were tired.
Clifford was going to remark that in this case the Baroness must desire greatly to bring about a marriage between Mr. Clifford Wentworth and Miss Elizabeth Acton; but he resolved, on the whole, to suppress this observation.
CHAPTER IX It seemed to Robert Acton, after Eugenia had come to his house, that something had passed between them which made them a good deal more intimate.
He asked himself whether it could be that he was in love with her, and then hoped he was not; hoped it not so much for his own sake as for that of the amatory passion itself.
If this was love, love had been overrated.
It was true, as Acton with his quietly cogitative habit observed to himself, that curiosity, pushed to a given point, might become a romantic passion; and he certainly thought enough about this charming woman to make him restless and even a little melancholy.
In his younger years he had been—or he had tried to be—of the opinion that it would be a good deal “jollier” not to marry, and he had flattered himself that his single condition was something of a citadel.
It was part of his curiosity to know why the deuce so susceptible a man was _not_ in love with so charming a woman.
There was a sort of excitement in the idea of seeing Madame Münster again; he became aware that his heart was beating rather faster than usual.
And in return—he’s in love with me.” It was Acton’s turn to stare.
For what purpose?” “He has an idea of being romantic.
Acton felt more surprise than he confessed to, for this was a new view of Clifford, whose irregularities had hitherto been quite without the romantic element.
“He must not be inconstant to poor Lizzie.” “To your sister?” “You know they are decidedly intimate,” said Acton.
If I were her father I should insist upon his marrying her; but it appears to be thought there is no urgency.
“What were you doing, last night, at Madame Münster’s?” Clifford began to laugh and to blush, by no means like a young man with a romantic secret.
And then, laying his hand on Clifford’s shoulder, he added, “Tell me one thing more: are you by chance a little in love with the Baroness?” “No, sir!” said Clifford, almost shaking off his hand.
“And do you propose to spend your life in making love to Gertrude Wentworth?” “Yes!” said Felix, smiling sidewise at his sister.
“I have secured Gertrude’s affection, but I am by no means sure that I have secured her fortune.
You know he wants her to marry Mr. Brand.” “I know nothing about it!” cried the Baroness.
I made up my mind at the outset that it was not my place to make love to Gertrude.” “So, to simplify matters, she made love to you!” Felix looked at his sister with sudden gravity.
“You expect, at any rate, to marry?” “I shall be greatly disappointed if we don’t.” “A disappointment or two will do you good!” the Baroness declared.
He looked at the Baroness, and then he kissed her.
“I am very much in love with Gertrude,” he said.
Robert Acton wants to marry me.” “No, I had not discovered that.
“He is the best fellow in the world.” “He is immensely in love with me,” said the Baroness.
It is probable that, in the last analysis, what she meant was that Felix should spare her the necessity of stating the case more exactly and should hold himself commissioned to assist her by all honorable means to marry the best fellow in the world.
He wished very much that Madame Münster would make a comfortable and honorable marriage.
“We fell in love with her from the first!” “You fell in love with Charlotte?” Mr.
Brand looked at him; but the young clergyman retained as yet quite enough self-possession to be able to say, with a good deal of solemnity, “She is not in love with you.” Felix gave a light laugh, and rejoined with the alacrity of a maritime adventurer who feels a puff of wind in his sail.
“Ah, no; if she were in love with me I should know it!
Poor Charlotte is dead in love with _you!_” Mr.
Felix was sure he was secretly struck with the romance of the situation.
“That’s a capital mixture.” CHAPTER XI Since that visit paid by the Baroness Münster to Mrs. Acton, of which some account was given at an earlier stage of this narrative, the intercourse between these two ladies had been neither frequent nor intimate.
My daughter will probably marry her cousin.” “Two such interesting young people,” said the Baroness, vaguely.
He was in love with her now; he was conscious of that, or he thought he was; and the only question with him was whether he could trust her.
“I am in love with your sister; but in love, Charlotte—in love!” the young man pursued.
“In short, I’m in love, dear lady,” said Felix.
Of course I want to marry her—and here is the difficulty.
You have wanted to marry her to Mr. Brand.” “Oh, no,” said Charlotte, very earnestly.
“Surely, marriage was what you proposed.” “Yes; but we didn’t wish to force her.” “_A la bonne heure!_ That’s very unsafe you know.
“If Gertrude is so—so strange,” she said, “why do you want to marry her?” “Ah, that’s it, dear Charlotte!
Brand is not so keen about his marriage as he was,” he presently said.
Is it because it is at night?” “The difference, Gertrude,” said Felix, stopping in the path, “the difference is that I love you more—more than before!” And then they stood there, talking, in the warm stillness and in front of the closed dark house.
It was not cheerful work, at the best, to keep giving small hammer-taps to the coffin in which one had laid away, for burial, the poor little unacknowledged offspring of one’s own misbehaving heart; and the occupation was not rendered more agreeable by the fact that the ghost of one’s stifled dream had been summoned from the shades by the strange, bold words of a talkative young foreigner.
To herself her sister’s justly depressed suitor had shown no sign of faltering.
“My dear uncle,” he said, “I desire, very earnestly, to marry your daughter Gertrude.” Charlotte sank slowly into her chair again, and Mr. Wentworth sat staring, with a light in his face that might have been flashed back from an iceberg.
She began to blush herself and to reflect that he might be much in love.
I simply fell head over heels in love; one can hardly help that.
“It may be that she is only becoming what you call a charming woman.” “Gertrude, at heart, is so earnest, so true,” said Charlotte, very softly, fastening her eyes upon her father.
“It is usually a fairly good thing for a girl to marry the man she loves!” cried Felix.
Gertrude looked at her intently an instant; then kissed her.
I am determined to marry this gentleman.” “You had better consent, sir,” said Felix very gently.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Gertrude had been looking hard at her former suitor.
“I should like to marry you.
“That was what he wanted to be; he wanted to do something fine.” “He won’t be comfortable till he has married us,” said Felix.
The two occupants of the chalet dined together, and the young man informed his companion that his marriage was now an assured fact.
You will love me a little, won’t you?
I think I may say I gain on being known.” And terminating these observations with the softest cadence of her voice, the Baroness imprinted a sort of grand official kiss upon Gertrude’s forehead.
“I hope, for our pleasure, that your brother’s marriage will detain you.” “Why should I stop for my brother’s marriage when I would not stop for my own?” asked the Baroness.
“We are to have another marriage,” Acton repeated, smiling.
“Another marriage?” And she looked at the others.
“I shall not wait for your marriage,” she said to her brother.
“Tomorrow my maid shall pack up.” “My dear sister,” Felix exclaimed, “we are to be married immediately!
My affairs are elsewhere.” “Where are you going?” “To Germany—by the first ship.” “You have decided not to marry Mr. Acton?” “I have refused him,” said Eugenia.
She passed her last evening at her uncle’s, where she had never been more charming; and in parting with Clifford Wentworth’s affianced bride she drew from her own finger a curious old ring and presented it to her with the prettiest speech and kiss.
Gertrude was for a good while a distant figure, but she came back when Charlotte married Mr.
Mr. Wentworth at last found himself listening for it; and Robert Acton, after his mother’s death, married a particularly nice young girl.

Till then I would love to have my hour as a native Maker, and be read by my own countryfolk in our own dying language: an ambition surely rather of the heart than of the head, so restricted as it is in prospect of endurance, so parochial in bounds of space.
TO K. DE M.—A lover of the moorland bare 17 X.
IN MEMORIAM F. A. S.—Yet, O stricken heart 58 XXVIII.
IN THE STATES—With half a heart 62 XXX.
SKERRYVORE—For love of lovely words 68 XXXV.
But I, the egg-shell pinnace, sleep On crystal waters ankle-deep: I, whose diminutive design, Of sweeter cedar, pithier pine, Is fashioned on so frail a mould, A hand may launch, a hand withhold: I, rather, with the leaping trout Wind, among lilies, in and out; I, the unnamed, inviolate, Green, rustic rivers, navigate; My dipping paddle scarcely shakes The berry in the bramble-brakes; Still forth on my green way I wend Beside the cottage garden-end; And by the nested angler fare, And take the lovers unaware.
A year ago, and blithely paired, Their rough-and-tumble play they shared; They kissed and quarrelled, laughed and cried, A year ago at Eastertide.
With bursting heart, with fiery face, She strove against him in the race; He unabashed her garter saw, That now would touch her skirts with awe.
Now by the stile ablaze she stops, And his demurer eyes he drops; Now they exchange averted sighs Or stand and marry silent eyes.
Let thyme the mountaineer (to dress The tinier birds) and wading cress, The lover of the shallow brook, From all my plots and borders look.
IX—TO K. DE M. A LOVER of the moorland bare And honest country winds, you were; The silver-skimming rain you took; And loved the floodings of the brook, Dew, frost and mountains, fire and seas, Tumultuary silences, Winds that in darkness fifed a tune, And the high-riding, virgin moon.
And you that loved the empty plain All redolent of wind and rain, Around you still the curlew sings— The freshness of the weather clings— The maiden jewels of the rain Sit in your dabbled locks again.
Strange is the seaman’s heart; he hopes, he fears; Draws closer and sweeps wider from that coast; Last, his rent sail refits, and to the deep His shattered prow uncomforted puts back.
This is unborn beauty: she Now in air floats high and free, Takes the sun and breaks the blue;— Late with stooping pinion flew Raking hedgerow trees, and wet Her wing in silver streams, and set Shining foot on temple roof: Now again she flies aloof, Coasting mountain clouds and kiss’t By the evening’s amethyst.
Hark, in these shady parlours, how it talks Of the near Autumn, how the smitten ash Trembles and augurs floods!
XV—ET TU IN ARCADIA VIXISTI (TO R. A. M. S.) IN ancient tales, O friend, thy spirit dwelt; There, from of old, thy childhood passed; and there High expectation, high delights and deeds, Thy fluttering heart with hope and terror moved.
Youth, love and roses blossom; the gaunt ward Dislimns and disappears, and, opening out, Shows brooks and forests, and the blue beyond Of mountains.
Not one quick beat of your warm heart, Nor thought that came to you apart, Pleasure nor pity, love nor pain Nor sorrow, has gone by in vain; But as some lone, wood-wandering child Brings home with him at evening mild The thorns and flowers of all the wild, From your whole life, O fair and true Your flowers and thorns you bring with you!
XXII—THE CELESTIAL SURGEON IF I have faltered more or less In my great task of happiness; If I have moved among my race And shown no glorious morning face; If beams from happy human eyes Have moved me not; if morning skies, Books, and my food, and summer rain Knocked on my sullen heart in vain:— Lord, thy most pointed pleasure take And stab my spirit broad awake; Or, Lord, if too obdurate I, Choose thou, before that spirit die, A piercing pain, a killing sin, And to my dead heart run them in!
My undissuaded heart I hear Whisper courage in my ear.
Thou, O my love, ye, O my friends— The gist of life, the end of ends— To laugh, to love, to live, to die, Ye call me by the ear and eye!
Forth from the casemate, on the plain Where honour has the world to gain, Pour forth and bravely do your part, O knights of the unshielded heart!
For those he loves that underprop With daily virtues Heaven’s top, And bear the falling sky with ease, Unfrowning caryatides.
XXIV NOT yet, my soul, these friendly fields desert, Where thou with grass, and rivers, and the breeze, And the bright face of day, thy dalliance hadst; Where to thine ear first sang the enraptured birds; Where love and thou that lasting bargain made.
Thou art with life Too closely woven, nerve with nerve intwined; Service still craving service, love for love, Love for dear love, still suppliant with tears.
XXVII—IN MEMORIAM F. A. S. YET, O stricken heart, remember, O remember How of human days he lived the better part.
April came to bloom and never dim December Breathed its killing chills upon the head or heart.
XXVIII—TO MY FATHER PEACE and her huge invasion to these shores Puts daily home; innumerable sails Dawn on the far horizon and draw near; Innumerable loves, uncounted hopes To our wild coasts, not darkling now, approach: Not now obscure, since thou and thine are there, And bright on the lone isle, the foundered reef, The long, resounding foreland, Pharos stands.
XXIX—IN THE STATES WITH half a heart I wander here As from an age gone by A brother—yet though young in years.
Yet still, about the human pale, I love to scamper, love to race, To swing by my irreverent tail All over the most holy place; And when at length, some golden day, The unfailing sportsman, aiming at, Shall bag, me—all the world shall say: _Thank God_, _and there’s an end of that_!
XXXIII—THE COUNTRY OF THE CAMISARDS {67} WE travelled in the print of olden wars, Yet all the land was green, And love we found, and peace, Where fire and war had been.
XXXIV—SKERRYVORE FOR love of lovely words, and for the sake Of those, my kinsmen and my countrymen, Who early and late in the windy ocean toiled To plant a star for seamen, where was then The surfy haunt of seals and cormorants: I, on the lintel of this cot, inscribe The name of a strong tower.
XXXV—SKERRYVORE: THE PARALLEL HERE all is sunny, and when the truant gull Skims the green level of the lawn, his wing Dispetals roses; here the house is framed Of kneaded brick and the plumed mountain pine, Such clay as artists fashion and such wood As the tree-climbing urchin breaks.
But hark to the sunny doves That make my roof the arena of their loves, That gyre about the gable all day long And fill the chimneys with their murmurous song: _Our house_, they say; and _mine_, the cat declares And spreads his golden fleece upon the chairs; And _mine_ the dog, and rises stiff with wrath If any alien foot profane the path.
“_What tongue does your auld bookie speak_?” He’ll spier; an’ I, his mou to steik: “_No bein’ fit to write in Greek_, _I write in Lallan_, _Dear to my heart as the peat reek_, _Auld as Tantallon_.
Here aft hae I, wi’ sober heart, For meditation sat apairt, When orra loves or kittle art Perplexed my mind; Here socht a balm for ilka smart O’ humankind.
The heart plays dunt wi’ main an’ micht; The lasses’ een are a’ sae bricht, Their dresses are sae braw an’ ticht, The bonny birdies!— Puir winter virtue at the sicht Gangs heels ower hurdies.
An’ aye as love frae land to land Tirls the drum wi’ eident hand, A’ men collect at her command, Toun-bred or land’art, An’ follow in a denty band Her gaucy standart.
An’ whiles, whan they tak heart again, An’ life i’ the sun looks braw an’ plain, Doun comes a jaw o’ droukin’ rain Upon their honours— God sends a spate outower the plain, Or mebbe thun’ers.
An’ food’s anither name for clart; An’ beasts an’ brambles bite an’ scart; An’ what would WE be like, my heart!
They ither folk, they court their joes At gloamin’ on the lea; But they’re made of a commoner clay, I suppose, Than a gentleman like me.
hoo the yammerin’ pain Stends to my heart!

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth, daughter of James Stevenson, Esq.
Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire; how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff, representing a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and motto:—“Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset,” and Sir Walter’s handwriting again in this finale:— “Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of the second Sir Walter.” Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot’s character; vanity of person and of situation.
Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman, sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never required indulgence afterwards.
She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters.
This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.
Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot’s death, and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other a widow.
That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman _does_ marry again, than when she does _not;_ but Sir Walter’s continuing in singleness requires explanation.
Lady Russell loved them all; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.
All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore _given_ all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.
Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister, made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it open on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, and pushed it away.
She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be, in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.
The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable, again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come; and the next tidings were that he was married.
The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.
Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?” and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.
It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned, after an unprosperous marriage, to her father’s house, with the additional burden of two children.
Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, and seemed to love her, rather because she would love her, than because Elizabeth deserved it.
She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience; but always in vain: Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.
He was a married man, and without children; the very state to be wished for.
Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have been enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.
They were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and deeply in love.
It must not be, if by any fair interference of friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother’s love, and mother’s rights, it would be prevented.
But he was confident that he should soon be rich: full of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted.
Young and gentle as she was, it might yet have been possible to withstand her father’s ill-will, though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister; but Lady Russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not, with such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner, be continually advising her in vain.
His genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.
She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority, but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy, she had no reason to believe him married.
She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.
“Mrs Clay,” said she, warmly, “never forgets who she is; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people.
Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had been completely in the old English style, containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees, substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage, enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young ’squire, it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the traveller’s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.
Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters.
She had never been staying there before, without being struck by it, or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her; for certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks, she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove: “So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in?” and this, without much waiting for an answer; or in the young ladies’ addition of, “I hope _we_ shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in a good situation: none of your Queen Squares for us!” or in the anxious supplement from Mary, of—“Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath!” She could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future, and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.
She was always on friendly terms with her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well, and respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had an object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.
Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary’s ailments lessened by having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family, since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.
Michaelmas came; and now Anne’s heart must be in Kellynch again.
A beloved home made over to others; all the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to own other eyes and other limbs!
“Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?” added Mrs Croft.
And in short, he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him; and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.
Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.
It was now his object to marry.
He was rich, and being turned on shore, fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted; actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.
He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way, excepting Anne Elliot.
With the exception, perhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached and happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open, no tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.
Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son, I dare say he would have been just such another by this time.” Anne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove relieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore, could not keep pace with the conversation of the others.
When he is married, if we have the good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and I, and a great many others, have done.
“When once married people begin to attack me with,—‘Oh!
“Pretty well, ma’am, in the fifteen years of my marriage; though many women have done more.
The Miss Hayters, the females of the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa, they both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals.
It was unvarying, warm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established, when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way.
Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.
No, no; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him, and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.” “Charles may say what he pleases,” cried Mary to Anne, as soon as he was out of the room, “but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for _her_, and still worse for _me;_ and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt that he has.
Either of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate, good-humoured wife.
With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings, the alteration could not be understood too soon.
It had then seemed the object nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it.
It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four—they were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.
Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home, where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife; for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite, she could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.
They were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.
It was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must, end in love with some.
It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing, might fall into.
If I loved a man, as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely by anybody else.” It was spoken with enthusiasm.
If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life, she will cherish all her present powers of mind.” He had done, and was unanswered.
We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead.
I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?” After a moment’s pause, Captain Wentworth said— “Do you mean that she refused him?” “Oh!
yes; certainly.” “When did that happen?” “I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time; but I believe about a year before he married Mary.
It was a remainder of former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart, which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.
The scenes in its neighbourhood, Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country, and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of Wight: these places must be visited, and visited again, to make the worth of Lyme understood.
“And yet,” said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward to meet the party, “he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart than I have.
On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends, and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many.
Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking, burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness, their uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England; that they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be respected and loved.
For, though shy, he did not seem reserved; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of the present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether _Marmion_ or _The Lady of the Lake_ were to be preferred, and how ranked the _Giaour_ and _The Bride of Abydos;_ and moreover, how the _Giaour_ was to be pronounced, he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines which imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness, and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood, that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry, and to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.
She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business; felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man as a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate’s being married.
“I wish,” said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion, “I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate with Dr Shirley.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said which of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most: Captain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate brother, hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes from one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible, or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him for help which he could not give.
To some of the best-looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived, she was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side, and Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back with feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately, and so light of heart, they had passed along.
A few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by her silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy and gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love, all that was most unlike Anne Elliot!
An hour’s complete leisure for such reflections as these, on a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell’s carriage exceedingly welcome; and yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House, or look an adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and comfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart.
The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch, and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.
Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy, but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt, that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards, be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove.
A new sort of way this, for a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress’s head, is not it, Miss Elliot?
His goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible.
“He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by: he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him, and he had not courage to come.
Mary knows it is.” But Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be left to be guessed.
Such a heart is very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?
Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of many months, and anxiously saying to herself, “Oh!
The circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of much extenuation.
This was an article not to be entered on by himself; but a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man, Sir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it.
She was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated, accomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.
Without that attraction, not all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was, moreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.
A very fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him!
Mr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once, evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they gave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof of cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place.
There was one point which Anne, on returning to her family, would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot’s being in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father’s not being in love with Mrs Clay; and she was very far from easy about it, when she had been at home a few hours.
The evil of a marriage would be much diminished, if Elizabeth were also to marry.
Everything united in him; good understanding, correct opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.
She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.
In fact, Anne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that she was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations; for though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved.
In London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living, it might be as you say: but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing: always acceptable as acquaintance.” “Well,” said Anne, “I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place.” “I love your indignation,” said he; “it is very natural.
Anne had gone unhappy to school, grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved, feeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen, of strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time; and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school, had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.
Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards, was said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all that Anne had known of her, till now that their governess’s account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.
Neither the dissipations of the past—and she had lived very much in the world—nor the restrictions of the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits.
Everybody’s heart is open, you know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak.
And what is her attraction?
For a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched.
She could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of the following autumn.
They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally.
Charles joins me in love, and everything proper.
Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.
We are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day.
Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her.
Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters.” Mary need not have feared her sister’s being in any degree prepared for the news.
Perhaps he had quitted the field, had given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.
Where could have been the attraction?
He had an affectionate heart.
He must love somebody.
He would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already; of course they had fallen in love over poetry.
No, it was not regret which made Anne’s heart beat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.
I am going home.” “That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.
Look, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.
Well, this Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.
He was courting her week after week.
But now, the matter has taken the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being to marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.
I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.” “Well, she is to marry him.
Nay, most likely they are married already, for I do not know what they should wait for.” “I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,” said Anne, “and I understand that he bears an excellent character.” “Oh!
She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick.
Had it been the effect of gratitude, had he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him, it would have been another thing.
with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!
A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman.
One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it, unless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case at Lyme.
His opinion of Louisa Musgrove’s inferiority, an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder at Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment; sentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance, were no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship and regard, but by the tenderness of the past.
He must love her.
His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch.” Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne’s eyes had caught the right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance.
Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection!
How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case, was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad, her affection would be his for ever.
Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy, could never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.
I am not going to marry Mr Elliot.
Do not forget me when you are married, that’s all.
As it was, she instantly submitted, and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne, eager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have received the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.
She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.
No, I thank you, I have nothing to trouble you with.” “I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?” “I did.” “Not before he was married, I suppose?” “Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.” “And—were you much acquainted?” “Intimately.” “Indeed!
Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character.
he is black at heart, hollow and black!” Anne’s astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause, and in a calmer manner, she added, “My expressions startle you.
He was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him, and thought him as good as himself.
The intimacy had been formed before our marriage.
I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained the highest opinion of him.
I never knew him myself; I only heard of him; but there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to my father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage, which I never could quite reconcile with present times.
I can satisfy you, perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage, I knew all about it at the time.
He was determined to make it by marriage.
He was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage; and I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course I cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities and invitations, were designing a match between the heir and the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.
It was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath, my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin; and that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father and sister.
Mr Elliot married then completely for money?
When one lives in the world, a man or woman’s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought.
She was a fine woman, had had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown by chance into Mr Elliot’s company, and fell in love with him; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side, with respect to her birth.
The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.
The baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; he is quite fool enough.
He truly wants to marry you.
His present attentions to your family are very sincere: quite from the heart.
Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.
‘Why, to be sure, ma’am,’ said she, ‘it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.’ And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart, is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter’s making a second match.
She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot’s marriage) they had been as before always together, and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.
Mr Elliot, raised by his marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself, (for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man), and beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend’s probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined.
She had previously, in the anticipation of their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature, since he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred, that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne’s feelings, as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot’s character would allow, when Anne’s refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way.
I considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet have made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him, than if he had been your husband.
My heart bled for you, as I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable, and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.
But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.
I was willing to hope that you must fare better.” Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed.
Mrs Clay’s selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded for the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot’s subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.
“Very well,” said Elizabeth, “I have nothing to send but my love.
My best love, of course.” “And mine,” added Sir Walter.
She had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that, very recently, (since Mary’s last letter to herself), Charles Hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years; and that on the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question, the two families had consented to the young people’s wishes, and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months, quite as soon as Louisa’s.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Henrietta was exactly in that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove’s real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress.
I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.
Anne talked of being perfectly ready, and tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair, in preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own sensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection, wherewith to pity her.
“And so, ma’am, all these thing considered,” said Mrs Musgrove, in her powerful whisper, “though we could have wished it different, yet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once, and make the best of it, as many others have done before them.
It is all very well, I used to say, for young people to be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement—” “Yes, dear ma’am,” said Mrs Croft, “or an uncertain engagement, an engagement which may be long.
To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can.” Anne found an unexpected interest here.
I will not allow it to be more man’s nature than woman’s to be inconstant and forget those they do love, or have loved.
No, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives.
I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.
All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.” She could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart was too full, her breath too much oppressed.
I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago.
Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death.
I have loved none but you.
Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged, I’ll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say.” Anne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity.
And there, as they slowly paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them, seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers, flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.
He persisted in having loved none but her.
I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man, at least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, ‘Was this for me?’” Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said, but the concert still more.
In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk would have been incurred, and all duty violated.” “Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,” he replied, “but I could not.
It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said— “I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now.
When any two young people take it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent, or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other’s ultimate comfort.
Sir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne, and no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion, was very far from thinking it a bad match for her.
On the contrary, when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims, and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen, with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour.
She loved Anne better than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.
It was creditable to have a sister married, and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn; and as her own sister must be better than her husband’s sisters, it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter.
Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell’s meaning to love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.
Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions, he could now value from his heart.
Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves, and their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend, secured her two.
Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits, as her friend Anne’s was in the warmth of her heart.
Anne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth’s affection.

For all who love shelter and the blessings of the sun, who hate dark weather and perpetual tilting against squalls, there could scarcely be found a more unhomely and harassing place of residence.
Her attraction is romantic in the narrowest meaning of the term.
The birds roost as willingly among the Corinthian capitals as in the crannies of the crag; the same atmosphere and daylight clothe the eternal rock and yesterday&#39;s imitation portico; and as the soft northern sunshine throws out everything into a glorified distinctness--or easterly mists, coming up with the blue evening, fuse all these incongruous features into one, and the lamps begin to glitter along the street, and faint lights to burn in the high windows across the valley--the feeling grows upon you that this also is a piece of nature in the most intimate sense; that this profusion of eccentricities, this dream in masonry and living rock, is not a drop-scene in a theatre, but a city in the world of every-day reality, connected by railway and telegraph-wire with all the capitals of Europe, and inhabited by citizens of the familiar type, who keep ledgers, and attend church, and have sold their immortal portion to a daily paper.
By all the canons of romance, the place demands to be half deserted and leaning towards decay; birds we might admit in profusion, the play of the sun and winds, and a few gipsies encamped in the chief thoroughfare; but these citizens with their cabs and tramways, their trains and posters, are altogether out of key.
Down by yon outlet rode Grahame of Claverhouse and his thirty dragoons, with the town beating to arms behind their horses&#39; tails--a sorry handful thus riding for their lives, but with a man at the head who was to return in a different temper, make a dash that staggered Scotland to the heart, and die happily in the thick of fight.
Here, you come into a court where the children are at play and the grown people sit upon their doorsteps, and perhaps a church spire shows itself above the roofs.
And thus, as I fancied, the dense life within made itself faintly audible in my ears, family after family contributing its quota to the general hum, and the whole pile beating in tune to its timepieces, like a great disordered heart.
As St. Giles&#39;s must have had in former days a rich and quaint appearance now forgotten, so the neighbourhood was bustling, sunless, and romantic.
Here, for example, is the shape of a heart let into the causeway.
Nor was the vision unsuitable to the locality; for after an hospital, what uglier piece is there in civilisation than a court of law?
I think I see them pause to count the strokes, and wander on again into the moving High Street, stunned and sick at heart.
The broadest of broad Scotch is now banished from the bench; but the courts still retain a certain national flavour.
Besides the courts, there are installed under the same roof no less than three libraries: two of no mean order; confused and semi-subterranean, full of stairs and galleries; where you may see the most studious-looking wigs fishing out novels by lanthorn light, in the very place where the old Privy Council tortured Covenanters.
Many a man&#39;s life has been argued away from him during long hours in the court above.
Ugly actions, above all in ugly places, have the true romantic quality, and become an undying property of their scene.
To a man like Scott, the different appearances of nature seemed each to contain its own legend ready made, which it was his to call forth: in such or such a place, only such or such events ought with propriety to happen; and in this spirit he made the _Lady of the Lake_ for Ben Venue, the _Heart of Midlothian_ for Edinburgh, and the _Pirate_, so indifferently written but so romantically conceived, for the desolate islands and roaring tideways of the North.
[Picture: The Canongate] Here, it is the tale of Begbie the bank-porter, stricken to the heart at a blow and left in his blood within a step or two of the crowded High Street.
A rat scampering within would send a shudder through the stoutest heart.
And surely there are few worse extremes than this extremity of zeal; and few more deplorable defections than this disloyalty to Christian love.
We seem to love for their own sake the emblems of time and the great change; and even around country churches you will find a wonderful exhibition of skulls, and crossbones, and noseless angels, and trumpets pealing for the Judgment Day.
Every mason was a pedestrian Holbein: he had a deep consciousness of death, and loved to put its terrors pithily before the churchyard loiterer; he was brimful of rough hints upon mortality, and any dead farmer was seized upon to be a text.
But his must have been indeed a heart of brass, to lie all day and night alone with the dead persecutor; and other lads were far from emulating him in courage.
Upon what ground, is of small account; if it be only the bishop who was burned for his faith in the antipodes, his memory lightens the heart and makes us walk undisturbed among graves.
I look back with delight on many an escalade of garden walls; many a ramble among lilacs full of piping birds; many an exploration in obscure quarters that were neither town nor country; and I think that both for my companions and myself, there was a special interest, a point of romance, and a sentiment as of foreign travel, when we hit in our excursions on the butt-end of some former hamlet, and found a few rustic cottages embedded among streets and squares.
It was a subterranean passage, although of a larger bore than we were accustomed to in Ainsworth&#39;s novels; and these two words, &#39;subterreanean passage,&#39; were in themselves an irresistible attraction, and seemed to bring us nearer in spirit to the heroes we loved and the black rascals we secretly aspired to imitate.
To scale the Castle Rock from West Princes Street Gardens, and lay a triumphal hand against the rampart itself, was to taste a high order of romantic pleasure.
And when the Spring comes round, and the hawthorns begin to flower, and the meadows to smell of young grass, even in the thickest of our streets, the country hilltops find out a young man&#39;s eyes, and set his heart beating for travel and pure air.
[Picture: Arthur&#39;s Seat] Immediately underneath upon the south, you command the yards of the High School, and the towers and courts of the new Jail--a large place, castellated to the extent of folly, standing by itself on the edge of a steep cliff, and often joyfully hailed by tourists as the Castle.
_Snell_, _blae_, _nirly_, and _scowthering_, are four of these significant vocables; they are all words that carry a shiver with them; and for my part, as I see them aligned before me on the page, I am persuaded that a big wind comes tearing over the Firth from Burntisland and the northern hills; I think I can hear it howl in the chimney, and as I set my face northwards, feel its smarting kisses on my cheek.
Both poverty and a northern climate teach men the love of the hearth and the sentiment of the family; and the latter, in its own right, inclines a poet to the praise of strong waters.
People go by, so drenched and draggle-tailed that I have often wondered how they found the heart to undress.
In a word, life is so unsightly that there are times when the heart turns sick in a man&#39;s inside; and the look of a tavern, or the thought of the warm, fire-lit study, is like the touch of land to one who has been long struggling with the seas.
There is yet another class who do not depend on corporal advantages, but support the winter in virtue of a brave and merry heart.
The person who saw this, and whose heart was full of bitterness at the moment, pocketed a reproof which has been of use to him ever since, and which he now hands on, with his good wishes, to the reader.
An indescribable cheerfulness breathes about the city; and the well-fed heart sits lightly and beats gaily in the--bosom.

685, every edition that I have seen since that of 1821 has &quot;I meant not all my heart might say,&quot; which is worse than nonsense, the correct reading being &quot;my heat.&quot;
Not thus, in ancient days of Caledon, [10] Was thy voice mute amid the festal crowd, When lay of hopeless love, or glory won, Aroused the fearful or subdued the proud.
though scarce my skill command Some feeble echoing of thine earlier lay: Though harsh and faint, and soon to die away, And all unworthy of thy nobler strain, Yet if one heart throb higher at its sway, The wizard note has not been touched in vain.
How sweet at eve the lover&#39;s lute Chime when the groves were still and mute!
forth starting at the sound, From underneath an aged oak That slanted from the islet rock, A damsel guider of its way, A little skiff shot to the bay, That round the promontory steep Led its deep line in graceful sweep, Eddying, in almost viewless wave, The weeping willow twig to rave, And kiss, with whispering sound and slow, The beach of pebbles bright as snow.
And seldom was a snood amid Such wild luxuriant ringlets hid, Whose glossy black to shame might bring The plumage of the raven&#39;s wing; And seldom o&#39;er a breast so fair Mantled a plaid with modest care, And never brooch the folds combined Above a heart more good and kind.
Her kindness and her worth to spy, You need but gaze on Ellen&#39;s eye; Not Katrine in her mirror blue Gives back the shaggy banks more true, Than every free-born glance confessed The guileless movements of her breast; Whether joy danced in her dark eye, Or woe or pity claimed a sigh, Or filial love was glowing there, Or meek devotion poured a prayer, Or tale of injury called forth The indignant spirit of the North.
On his bold visage middle age Had slightly pressed its signet sage, Yet had not quenched the open truth And fiery vehemence of youth; Forward and frolic glee was there, The will to do, the soul to dare, The sparkling glance, soon blown to fire, Of hasty love or headlong ire.
His limbs were cast in manly could For hardy sports or contest bold; And though in peaceful garb arrayed, And weaponless except his blade, His stately mien as well implied A high-born heart, a martial pride, As if a baron&#39;s crest he wore, And sheathed in armor bode the shore.
A wanderer, here by fortune toss, My way, my friends, my courser lost, I ne&#39;er before, believe me, fair, Have ever drawn your mountain air, Till on this lake&#39;s romantic strand I found a fey in fairy land!&#39;
The mistress of the mansion came, Mature of age, a graceful dame, Whose easy step and stately port Had well become a princely court, To whom, though more than kindred knew, Young Ellen gave a mother&#39;s due.
Well showed the elder lady&#39;s mien That courts and cities she had seen; Ellen, though more her looks displayed The simple grace of sylvan maid, In speech and gesture, form and face, Showed she was come of gentle race.
At length, with Ellen in a grove He seemed to walk and speak of love; She listened with a blush and sigh, His suit was warm, his hopes were high.
The wild rose, eglantine, and broom Wasted around their rich perfume; The birch-trees wept in fragrant balm; The aspens slept beneath the calm; The silver light, with quivering glance, Played on the water&#39;s still expanse,-- Wild were the heart whose passion&#39;s sway Could rage beneath the sober ray!
&#39;High place to thee in royal court, High place in battled line, Good hawk and hound for sylvan sport!
True be thy sword, thy friend sincere, Thy lady constant, kind, and dear, And lost in love&#39;s and friendship&#39;s smile Be memory of the lonely isle!
&#39;Or if on life&#39;s uncertain main Mishap shall mar thy sail; If faithful, wise, and brave in vain, Woe, want, and exile thou sustain Beneath the fickle gale; Waste not a sigh on fortune changed, On thankless courts, or friends estranged, But come where kindred worth shall smile, To greet thee in the lonely isle.&#39;
dear lady, thus it sighed, The eve thy sainted mother died; And such the sounds which, while I strove To wake a lay of war or love, Came marring all the festal mirth, Appalling me who gave them birth, And, disobedient to my call, Wailed loud through Bothwell&#39;s bannered hall.
For me&#39;--she stooped, and, looking round, Plucked a blue harebell from the ground,-- &#39;For me, whose memory scarce conveys An image of more splendid days, This little flower that loves the lea May well my simple emblem be; It drinks heaven&#39;s dew as blithe as rose That in the King&#39;s own garden grows; And when I place it in my hair, Allan, a bard is bound to swear He ne&#39;er saw coronet so fair.&#39;
O. might I live to see thee grace, In Scotland&#39;s court, thy birthright place, To see my favorite&#39;s step advance The lightest in the courtly dance, The cause of every gallant&#39;s sigh, And leading star of every eye, And theme of every minstrel&#39;s art, The Lady of the Bleeding Heart!&#39;
Slave of thy will, this chieftain dread, Yet, O loved maid, thy mirth refrain!
Rather will Ellen Douglas dwell A votaress in Maronnan&#39;s cell; Rather through realms beyond the sea, Seeking the world&#39;s cold charity Where ne&#39;er was spoke a Scottish word, And ne&#39;er the name of Douglas heard An outcast pilgrim will she rove, Than wed the man she cannot love.
While yet a child,--and children know, Instinctive taught, the friend and foe,-- I shuddered at his brow of gloom, His shadowy plaid and sable plume; A maiden grown, I ill could bear His haughty mien and lordly air: But, if thou join&#39;st a suitor&#39;s claim, In serious mood, to Roderick&#39;s name.
Loose on the breeze their tresses flew, And high their snowy arms they threw, As echoing back with shrill acclaim, And chorus wild, the Chieftain&#39;s name; While, prompt to please, with mother&#39;s art The darling passion of his heart, The Dame called Ellen to the strand, To greet her kinsman ere he land: &#39;Come, loiterer, come!
Nor while on Ellen&#39;s faltering tongue Her filial welcomes crowded hung, Marked she that fear--affection&#39;s proof-- Still held a graceful youth aloof; No!
Yet trust me, Malcolm, not so proud Was I of all that marshalled crowd, Though the waned crescent owned my might, And in my train trooped lord and knight, Though Blantyre hymned her holiest lays, And Bothwell&#39;s bards flung back my praise, As when this old man&#39;s silent tear, And this poor maid&#39;s affection dear, A welcome give more kind and true Than aught my better fortunes knew.
The flush of shame-faced joy to hide, The hounds, the hawk, her cares divide; The loved caresses of the maid The dogs with crouch and whimper paid; And, at her whistle, on her hand The falcon took his favorite stand, Closed his dark wing, relaxed his eye, Nor, though unhooded, sought to fly.
And, trust, while in such guise she stood, Like fabled Goddess of the wood, That if a father&#39;s partial thought O&#39;erweighed her worth and beauty aught, Well might the lover&#39;s judgment fail To balance with a juster scale; For with each secret glance he stole, The fond enthusiast sent his soul.
His form accorded with a mind Lively and ardent, frank and kind; A blither heart, till Ellen came Did never love nor sorrow tame; It danced as lightsome in his breast As played the feather on his crest.
Not Ellen more my pride and joy; I love him still, despite my wrongs By hasty wrath and slanderous tongues.
My sovereign holds in ward my land, My uncle leads my vassal band; To tame his foes, his friends to aid, Poor Malcolm has but heart and blade.
Yet, if there be one faithful Graeme Who loves the chieftain of his name, Not long shall honored Douglas dwell Like hunted stag in mountain cell; Nor, ere yon pride-swollen robber dare,-- I may not give the rest to air!
The Summer dawn&#39;s reflected hue To purple changed Loch Katrine blue; Mildly and soft the western breeze Just kissed the lake, just stirred the trees, And the pleased lake, like maiden coy, Trembled but dimpled not for joy The mountain-shadows on her breast Were neither broken nor at rest; In bright uncertainty they lie, Like future joys to Fancy&#39;s eye.
The water-lily to the light Her chalice reared of silver bright; The doe awoke, and to the lawn, Begemmed with dew-drops, led her fawn; The gray mist left the mountain-side, The torrent showed its glistening pride; Invisible in flecked sky The lark sent clown her revelry: The blackbird and the speckled thrush Good-morrow gave from brake and bush; In answer cooed the cushat dove Her notes of peace and rest and love.
Not his the mien of Christian priest, But Druid&#39;s, from the grave released Whose hardened heart and eye might brook On human sacrifice to look; And much, &#39;t was said, of heathen lore Mixed in the charms he muttered o&#39;er.
It might have tamed a warrior&#39;s heart To view such mockery of his art!
The knot-grass fettered there the hand Which once could burst an iron band; Beneath the broad and ample bone, That bucklered heart to fear unknown, A feeble and a timorous guest, The fieldfare framed her lowly nest; There the slow blindworm left his slime On the fleet limbs that mocked at time; And there, too, lay the leader&#39;s skull Still wreathed with chaplet, flushed and full, For heath-bell with her purple bloom Supplied the bonnet and the plume.
Eager he read whatever tells Of magic, cabala, and spells, And every dark pursuit allied To curious and presumptuous pride; Till with fired brain and nerves o&#39;erstrung, And heart with mystic horrors wrung, Desperate he sought Benharrow&#39;s den, And hid him from the haunts of men.
Late had he heard, in prophet&#39;s dream, The fatal Ben-Shie&#39;s boding scream; Sounds, too, had come in midnight blast Of charging steeds, careering fast Along Benharrow&#39;s shingly side, Where mortal horseman ne&#39;er might ride; The thunderbolt had split the pine,-- All augured ill to Alpine&#39;s line.
May ravens tear the careless eyes, Wolves make the coward heart their prize!
Mingled with love&#39;s impatience, came The manly thirst for martial fame; The stormy joy of mountaineers Ere yet they rush upon the spears; And zeal for Clan and Chieftain burning, And hope, from well-fought field returning, With war&#39;s red honors on his crest, To clasp his Mary to his breast.
The heath this night must be my bed, The bracken curtain for my head, My lullaby the warder&#39;s tread, Far, far, from love and thee, Mary; To-morrow eve, more stilly laid, My couch may be my bloody plaid, My vesper song thy wail, sweet maid!
No fond regret must Norman know; When bursts Clan-Alpine on the foe, His heart must be like bended bow, His foot like arrow free, Mary.
A time will come with feeling fraught, For, if I fall in battle fought, Thy hapless lover&#39;s dying thought Shall be a thought on thee, Mary.
All backward came with news of truce; Still lay each martial Graeme and Bruce, In Rednock courts no horsemen wait, No banner waved on Cardross gate, On Duchray&#39;s towers no beacon shone, Nor scared the herons from Loch Con; All seemed at peace.--Now wot ye wily The Chieftain with such anxious eye, Ere to the muster he repair, This western frontier scanned with care?-- In Benvenue&#39;s most darksome cleft, A fair though cruel pledge was left; For Douglas, to his promise true, That morning from the isle withdrew, And in a deep sequestered dell Had sought a low and lonely cell.
Gray Superstition&#39;s whisper dread Debarred the spot to vulgar tread; For there, she said, did fays resort, And satyrs hold their sylvan court, By moonlight tread their mystic maze, And blast the rash beholder&#39;s gaze.
It was but with that dawning morn That Roderick Dhu had proudly sworn To drown his love in war&#39;s wild roar, Nor think of Ellen Douglas more; But he who stems a stream with sand, And fetters flame with flaxen band, Has yet a harder task to prove,-- By firm resolve to conquer love!
Eve finds the Chief, like restless ghost, Still hovering near his treasure lost; For though his haughty heart deny A parting meeting to his eye Still fondly strains his anxious ear The accents of her voice to hear, And inly did he curse the breeze That waked to sound the rustling trees.
The rose is fairest when &#39;t is budding new, And hope is brightest when it dawns from fears; The rose is sweetest washed with morning dew And love is loveliest when embalmed in tears.
O wilding rose, whom fancy thus endears, I bid your blossoms in my bonnet wave, Emblem of hope and love through future years!&#39;
I love to hear of worthy foes.
Clan-Alpine&#39;s men Shall man the Trosachs&#39; shaggy glen; Within Loch Katrine&#39;s gorge we&#39;ll fight, All in our maids&#39; and matrons&#39; sight, Each for his hearth and household fire, Father for child, and son for sire Lover for maid beloved!--But why Is it the breeze affects mine eye?
sooner may the Saxon lance Unfix Benledi from his stance, Than doubt or terror can pierce through The unyielding heart of Roderick Dhu!
The Minstrel tried his simple art, Rut distant far was Ellen&#39;s heart.
&#39;O Alice Brand, my native land Is lost for love of you; And we must hold by wood and word, As outlaws wont to do.
&#39;Lay on him the curse of the withered heart, The curse of the sleepless eye; Till he wish and pray that his life would part, Nor yet find leave to die.&#39;
&quot;Tis merry, &#39;tis merry, in Fairy-land, When fairy birds are singing, When the court cloth ride by their monarch&#39;s side, With bit and bridle ringing: &#39;And gayly shines the Fairy-land-- But all is glistening show, Like the idle gleam that December&#39;s beam Can dart on ice and snow.
The meanest serf in Roderick&#39;s clan Had not been bribed, by love or fear, Unknown to him to guide thee here.&#39;
&#39;Sweet Ellen, dear my life must be, Since it is worthy care from thee; Yet life I hold but idle breath When love or honor&#39;s weighed with death.
&#39;t were female art, To say I do not read thy heart; Too much, before, my selfish ear Was idly soothed my praise to hear.
Fitz-James knew every wily train A lady&#39;s fickle heart to gain, But here he knew and felt them vain.
There shot no glance from Ellen&#39;s eye, To give her steadfast speech the lie; In maiden confidence she stood, Though mantled in her cheek the blood And told her love with such a sigh Of deep and hopeless agony, As death had sealed her Malcolm&#39;s doom And she sat sorrowing on his tomb.
&#39;O little know&#39;st thou Roderick&#39;s heart!
He placed the golden circlet on, Paused--kissed her hand--and then was gone.
&#39;Twas thus my hair they bade me braid, They made me to the church repair; It was my bridal morn they said, And my true love would meet me there.
&#39;See the gray pennons I prepare, To seek my true love through the air!
Mine eye has dried and wasted been, But still it loves the Lincoln green; And, though mine ear is all unstrung, Still, still it loves the Lowland tongue.
&#39;For O my sweet William was forester true, He stole poor Blanche&#39;s heart away!
prove thy speed, For ne&#39;er had Alpine&#39;s son such need; With heart of fire, and foot of wind, The fierce avenger is behind!
Fate judges of the rapid strife-- The forfeit death--the prize is life; Thy kindred ambush lies before, Close couched upon the heathery moor; Them couldst thou reach!--it may not be Thine ambushed kin thou ne&#39;er shalt see, The fiery Saxon gains on thee!-- Resistless speeds the deadly thrust, As lightning strikes the pine to dust; With foot and hand Fitz-James must strain Ere he can win his blade again.
more bright Let reason beam her parting light!-- O. by thy knighthood&#39;s honored sign, And for thy life preserved by mine, When thou shalt see a darksome man, Who boasts him Chief of Alpine&#39;s Clan, With tartars broad and shadowy plume, And hand of blood, and brow of gloom Be thy heart bold, thy weapon strong, And wreak poor Blanche of Devan&#39;s wrong!-- They watch for thee by pass and fell... Avoid the path... O God!...
A kindly heart had brave Fitz-James; Fast poured his eyes at pity&#39;s claims; And now, with mingled grief and ire, He saw the murdered maid expire.
Free be they flung!--as free shall wave Clan-Alpine&#39;s pine in banner brave.
&#39;Warrior, but yester-morn I knew Naught of thy Chieftain, Roderick Dhu, Save as an outlawed desperate man, The chief of a rebellious clan, Who, in the Regent&#39;s court and sight, With ruffian dagger stabbed a knight; Yet this alone might from his part Sever each true and loyal heart.&#39;
He rights such wrong where it is given, If it were in the court of heaven.&#39;
X. Fitz-James was brave:--though to his heart The life-blood thrilled with sudden start, He manned himself with dauntless air, Returned the Chief his haughty stare, His back against a rock he bore, And firmly placed his foot before:-- &#39;Come one, come all!
It nerves my heart, it steels my sword; For I have sworn this braid to stain In the best blood that warms thy vein.
Now yield thee, or by Him who made The world, thy heart&#39;s blood dyes my blade!
--the steed obeyed, With arching neck and bended head, And glancing eye and quivering ear, As if he loved his lord to hear.
Away, away, to court, to show The near approach of dreaded foe: The King must stand upon his guard; Douglas and he must meet prepared.&#39;
James will be there; he loves such show, Where the good yeoman bends his bow, And the tough wrestler foils his foe, As well as where, in proud career, The high-born filter shivers spear.
I&#39;ll follow to the Castle-park, And play my prize;--King James shall mark If age has tamed these sinews stark, Whose force so oft in happier days His boyish wonder loved to praise.&#39;
But in the train you might discern Dark lowering brow and visage stern; There nobles mourned their pride restrained, And the mean burgher&#39;s joys disdained; And chiefs, who, hostage for their clan, Were each from home a banished man, There thought upon their own gray tower, Their waving woods, their feudal power, And deemed themselves a shameful part Of pageant which they cursed in heart.
Indignant smiled the Douglas proud, And threw the gold among the crowd, Who now with anxious wonder scan, And sharper glance, the dark gray man; Till whispers rose among the throng, That heart so free, and hand so strong, Must to the Douglas blood belong.
Or if I suffer causeless wrong, Is then my selfish rage so strong, My sense of public weal so low, That, for mean vengeance on a foe, Those cords of love I should unbind Which knit my country and my kind?
O let your patience ward such ill, And keep your right to love me still!&#39;
Even the rough soldier&#39;s heart was moved; As if behind some bier beloved, With trailing arms and drooping head, The Douglas up the hill he led, And at the Castle&#39;s battled verge, With sighs resigned his honoured charge.
The offended Monarch rode apart, With bitter thought and swelling heart, And would not now vouchsafe again Through Stirling streets to lead his train.
These drew not for their fields the sword, Like tenants of a feudal lord, Nor owned the patriarchal claim Of Chieftain in their leader&#39;s name; Adventurers they, from far who roved, To live by battle which they loved.
kiss Gillian the quicker, Till she bloom like a rose, and a fig for the vicar!
I go to call The Captain of our watch to hall: There lies my halberd on the floor; And he that steps my halberd o&#39;er, To do the maid injurious part, My shaft shall quiver in his heart!
Soon as the day flings wide his gates, The King shall know what suitor waits.
The rest with thanks their guerdon took, But Brent, with shy and awkward look, On the reluctant maiden&#39;s hold Forced bluntly back the proffered gold:-- &#39;Forgive a haughty English heart, And O, forget its ruder part!
And, but I loved to drive the deer More than to guide the labouring steer, I had not dwelt an outcast here.

And, when its notes awake again, Even she, so long beloved in vain, Shall with my harp her voice combine, And mix her woe and tears with mine, To wail Clan-Alpine&#39;s honoured Pine.&#39;
Ellen the while, with bursting heart, Remained in lordly bower apart, Where played, with many-coloured gleams, Through storied pane the rising beams.
No more at dawning morn I rise, And sun myself in Ellen&#39;s eyes, Drive the fleet deer the forest through, And homeward wend with evening dew; A blithesome welcome blithely meet, And lay my trophies at her feet, While fled the eve on wing of glee,-- That life is lost to love and me!&#39;

With heating heart, and bosom wrung, As to a brother&#39;s arm she clung.
Still by Fitz-James her footing staid; A few faint steps she forward made, Then slow her drooping head she raised, And fearful round the presence gazed; For him she sought who owned this state, The dreaded Prince whose will was fate!-- She gazed on many a princely port Might well have ruled a royal court; On many a splendid garb she gazed,-- Then turned bewildered and amazed, For all stood bare; and in the room Fitz-James alone wore cap and plume.
Gently he raised her,--and, the while, Checked with a glance the circle&#39;s smile; Graceful, but grave, her brow he kissed, And bade her terrors be dismissed:-- &#39;Yes, fair; the wandering poor Fitz-James The fealty of Scotland claims.
I know his heart, I know his hand, Have shared his cheer, and proved his brand; My fairest earldom would I give To bid Clan-Alpine&#39;s Chieftain live!-- Hast thou no other boon to crave?
I had also read a great deal, seen much, and heard more, of that romantic country where I was in the habit of spending some time every autumn; and the scenery of Lock Katrine was connected with the recollection of many a dear friend and merry expedition of former days.
This poem, the action of which lay among scenes so beautiful and so deeply imprinted on my recollections, was a labour of love, and it was no less so to recall the manners and incidents introduced.
A lady, to whom I was nearly related, and with whom I lived, during her whole life, on the most brotherly terms of affection, was residing with me at the time when the work was in progress, and used to ask me, what I could possibly do to rise so early in the morning (that happening to be the most convenient to me for composition).
At last I told her the subject of my meditations; and I can never forget the anxiety and affection expressed in her reply.
I replied to this affectionate expostulation in the words of Montrose,-- &quot;&#39;He either fears his fate too much, Or his deserts are small, Who dares not put it to the touch To gain or lose it all.&#39;
Afterwards I showed my affectionate and anxious critic the first canto of the poem, which reconciled her to my imprudence.
In such cases, affection rises like a light on the canvas, improves any favourable tints which it formerly exhibited, and throws its defects into the shade.
After a considerable delay, The Lady of the Lake appeared in June, 1810; and its success was certainly so extraordinary as to induce me for the moment to conclude that I had at last fixed a nail in the proverbially inconstant wheel of Fortune, whose stability in behalf of an individual who had so boldly courted her favours for three successive times had not as yet been shaken.

From the habits of frugality and observation which he acquired in his humble situation, the historian traces that intimate acquaintance with popular character which enabled him to rise so high in the state, and that honorable economy by which he repaired and established the shattered estates of Angus and Morton (History of the House of Douglas, Edinburgh, 1743, vol.

278): &quot;And thus Nature becomes dear to Scott in a threefold way: dear to him, first, as containing those remains or memories of the past, which he cannot find in cities, and giving hope of Praetorian mound or knight&#39;s grave in every green slope and shade of its desolate places; dear, secondly, in its moorland liberty, which has for him just as high a charm as the fenced garden had for the mediaeval;... and dear to him, finally, in that perfect beauty, denied alike in cities and in men, for which every modern heart had begun at last to thirst, and Scott&#39;s, in its freshness and power, of all men&#39;s most earnestly.
&quot;And in this love of beauty, observe that the love of colour is a leading element, his healthy mind being incapable of losing, under any modern false teaching, its joy in brilliancy of hue.
The first, that the love of natural history, excited by the continual attention now given to all wild landscape, heightens reciprocally the interest of that landscape, and becomes an important element in Scott&#39;s description, leading him to finish, down to the minutest speckling of breast, and slightest shade of attributed emotion, the portraiture of birds and animals; in strange opposition to Homer&#39;s slightly named &#39;sea-crows, who have care of the works of the sea,&#39; and Dante&#39;s singing-birds, of undefined species.

Scott says here: &quot;Inspection of the provincial map of Perthshire, or any large map of Scotland, will trace the progress of the signal through the small district of lakes and mountains, which, in exercise of my imaginary chieftain, and which, at the period of my romance, was really occupied by a clan who claimed a descent from Alpine,--a clan the most unfortunate and most persecuted, but neither the least distinguished, least powerful, nor least brave of the tribes of the Gael.

Pope Having, in the tale of the Heart of Mid-Lothian, succeeded in some degree in awakening an interest in behalf of one devoid of those accomplishments which belong to a heroine almost by right, I was next tempted to choose a hero upon the same unpromising plan; and as worth of character, goodness of heart, and rectitude of principle, were necessary to one who laid no claim to high birth, romantic sensibility, or any of the usual accomplishments of those who strut through the pages of this sort of composition, I made free with the name of a person who has left the most magnificent proofs of his benevolence and charity that the capital of Scotland has to display.
Lady Mary Wortley Montague has said, with equal truth and taste, that the most romantic region of every country is that where the mountains unite themselves with the plains or lowlands.
The entertainments and amusements of Elizabeth&#39;s time had an air of that decent restraint which became the court of a maiden sovereign; and, in that earlier period, to use the words of Burke, vice lost half its evil by being deprived of all its grossness.
The learned Mr. D&#39;Israeli, in an attempt to vindicate the character of James, has only succeeded in obtaining for himself the character of a skilful and ingenious advocate, without much advantage to his royal client] Such being the state of the court, coarse sensuality brought along with it its ordinary companion, a brutal degree of undisguised selfishness, destructive alike of philanthropy and good breeding; both of which, in their several spheres, depend upon the regard paid by each individual to the interest as well as the feelings of others.
“Captain Hackum, a blockheaded bully of Alsatia, a cowardly, impudent, blustering fellow, formerly a sergeant in Flanders, who has run from his colours, and retreated into Whitefriars for a very small debt, where by the Alsatians he is dubb&#39;d a captain, marries one that lets lodgings, sells cherry-brandy, and is a bawd.
_Captain._ And the story is, I hope, natural and probable; commencing strikingly, proceeding naturally, ending happily--like the course of a famed river, which gushes from the mouth of some obscure and romantic grotto--then gliding on, never pausing, never precipitating its course, visiting, as it were, by natural instinct, whatever worthy subjects of interest are presented by the country through which it passes--widening and deepening in interest as it flows on; and at length arriving at the final catastrophe as at some mighty haven, where ships of all kinds strike sail and yard?
my dear sir, you do not know the force of paternal affection.
I am not what you take me for;”--words which seemed so opposite to the circumstances, that I should not have much minded them, had it not been for the peculiarly hollow sound in which they were uttered.--“Know, then,” she said, in the same unearthly accents, “that I am the spirit of Betty Barnes.”--“Who hanged herself for love of the stage-coachman,” thought I; “this is a proper spot of work!”--“Of that unhappy Elizabeth or Betty Barnes, long cook-maid to Mr. Warburton, the painful collector, but ah!
I mean Allan Cunningham, who has just published his tragedy of Sir Marmaduke Maxwell, full of merry-making and murdering, kissing and cutting of throats, and passages which lead to nothing, and which are very pretty passages for all that.
But no man of honour, genius, or spirit, would make the mere love of gain, the chief, far less the only, purpose of his labours.
For myself, I am not displeased to find the game a winning one; yet while I pleased the public, I should probably continue it merely for the pleasure of playing; for I have felt as strongly as most folks that love of composition, which is perhaps the strongest of all instincts, driving the author to the pen, the painter to the pallet, often without either the chance of fame or the prospect of reward.
But, notwithstanding all his precautions, historians have recorded many instances, where the mutual hatred of two nations, who, after being enemies for a thousand years, had been so very recently united, broke forth with a fury which menaced a general convulsion; and, spreading from the highest to the lowest classes, as it occasioned debates in council and parliament, factions in the court, and duels among the gentry, was no less productive of riots and brawls amongst the lower orders.
He knew every lane, blind alley, and sequestered court of the ward, better than his catechism; was alike active in his master&#39;s affairs, and in his own adventures of fun and mischief; and so managed matters, that the credit he acquired by the former bore him out, or at least served for his apology, when the latter propensity led him into scrapes, of which, however, it is but fair to state, that they had hitherto inferred nothing mean or discreditable.
Upon the whole, however, the youths were attached to their master, and he, a good-natured, though an absent and whimsical man, was scarce less so to them; and when a little warmed with wine at an occasional junketing, he used to boast, in his northern dialect, of his “twa bonnie lads, and the looks that the court ladies threw at them, when visiting his shop in their caroches, when on a frolic into the city.” But David Ramsay never failed, at the same time, to draw up his own tall, thin, lathy skeleton, extend his lean jaws into an alarming grin, and indicate, by a nod of his yard-long visage, and a twinkle of his little grey eye, that there might be more faces in Fleet Street worth looking at than those of Frank and Jenkin.
“Here is a tester to cherish thy wit, good boy,” he said.
I am not the first &#39;prentice has married his master&#39;s daughter, I suppose?” “They kept their own secret, I fancy,” said Tunstall, “at least till they were out of their time.” “I tell you what it is, Frank,” answered Jenkin, sharply, “that may be the fashion of you gentlefolks, that are taught from your biggin to carry two faces under the same hood, but it shall never be mine.” “There are the stairs, then,” said Tunstall, coolly; “go up and ask Mrs. Marget of our master just now, and see what sort of a face he will wear under _his_ hood.” “No, I wonnot,” answered Jenkin; “I am not such a fool as that neither.
Such as we have described him, Nigel Olifaunt, or rather the young Lord Glenvarloch, was, when our narrative takes him up, under great perplexity respecting the fate of his trusty and only follower, Richard Moniplies, who had been dispatched by his young master, early the preceding morning, as far as the court at Westminster, but had not yet returned.
I was a bare-headed girl at the time, and lived in the neighbourhood, though I had little thought of marrying John then, who had a score of years the better of me--but he is a thriving man and a kind husband--and his father, as I was saying, died as fat as a church-warden.
I assure you, some of the best of the city have married Scotsmen.
There was Lady Trebleplumb, Sir Thomas Trebleplumb the great Turkey merchant&#39;s widow, married Sir Awley Macauley, whom your honour knows, doubtless; and pretty Mistress Doublefee, old Sergeant Doublefee&#39;s daughter, jumped out of window, and was married at May-fair to a Scotsman with a hard name; and old Pitchpost the timber merchant&#39;s daughters did little better, for they married two Irishmen; and when folks jeer me about having a Scotsman for lodger, meaning your honour, I tell them they are afraid of their daughters and their mistresses; and sure I have a right to stand up for the Scots, since John Christie is half a Scotsman, and a thriving man, and a good husband, though there is a score of years between us; and so I would have your honour cast care away, and mend your breakfast with a morsel and a draught.” “At a word, my kind hostess, I cannot,” said Olifaunt; “I am anxious about this knave of mine, who has been so long absent in this dangerous town of yours.” It may be noticed in passing that Dame Nelly&#39;s ordinary mode of consolation was to disprove the existence of any cause for distress; and she is said to have carried this so far as to comfort a neighbour, who had lost her husband, with the assurance that the dear defunct would be better to-morrow, which perhaps might not have proved an appropriate, even if it had been a possible, mode of relief.
Inexperienced, however, in public affairs as he certainly was, it required only a moment&#39;s consideration to convince him of the improbability of an expectation so contrary to all he had heard of etiquette, as well as the dilatory proceedings in a court suit, and he answered the good-natured hostess with a sigh, that he doubted whether the king would even look on the paper addressed to him, far less take it into his immediate consideration.
And he has made a comely Court at Whitehall, just by the river; and since the king is so good a friend to the Thames, I cannot see, if it please your honour, why all his subjects, and your honour in specialty, should not have satisfaction by his hands.” “True, dame--true,--let us hope for the best; but I must take my cloak and rapier, and pray your husband in courtesy to teach me the way to a magistrate.” “Sure, sir,” said the prompt dame, “I can do that as well as he, who has been a slow man of his tongue all his life, though I will give him his due for being a loving husband, and a man as well to pass in the world as any betwixt us and the top of the lane.
It is usually months and years ere the Court and a suitor shake hands and part.” “My business,” said Lord Nigel, with a brevity which was intended to stop further discussion, “was summarily dispatched.” Still Master Heriot remained seated, and there was a cordial good-humour added to the reverence of his appearance, which rendered it impossible for Lord Nigel to be more explicit in requesting his absence.
Had not my father stood by him with heart, sword, and fortune, he might never have seen the Court of England himself.” “But by whom was this Supplication presented, my lord?” said Heriot; “for the distaste taken at the messenger will sometimes extend itself to the message.” “By my servant,” said the Lord Nigel; “by the man you saw, and, I think, were kind to.” “By your servant, my lord?” said the citizen; “he seems a shrewd fellow, and doubtless a faithful; but surely--” “You would say,” said Lord Nigel, “he is no fit messenger to a king&#39;s presence?--Surely he is not; but what could I do?
You have cause to be angry, but still I think the knave mistook more out of conceit than of purpose; and I judge you will have the better service of him another time, if you overlook this fault--Get you gone, sirrah--I&#39;ll make your peace.” “Na, na,” said Moniplies, keeping his ground firmly, “if he likes to strike a lad that has followed him for pure love, for I think there has been little servant&#39;s fee between us, a&#39; the way frae Scotland, just let my lord be doing, and see the credit he will get by it--and I would rather (mony thanks to you though, Master George) stand by a lick of his baton, than it suld e&#39;er be said a stranger came between us.” “Go, then,” said his master, “and get out of my sight.” “Aweel I wot that is sune done,” said Moniplies, retiring slowly; “I did not come without I had been ca&#39;d for--and I wad have been away half an hour since with my gude will, only Maister George keepit me to answer his interrogation, forsooth, and that has made a&#39; this stir.” And so he made his grumbling exit, with the tone much rather of one who has sustained an injury, than who has done wrong.
“There never was a man so plagued as I am with a malapert knave!--The fellow is shrewd, and I have found him faithful--I believe he loves me, too, and he has given proofs of it--but then he is so uplifted in his own conceit, so self-willed, and so self-opinioned, that he seems to become the master and I the man; and whatever blunder he commits, he is sure to make as loud complaints, as if the whole error lay with me, and in no degree with himself.” “Cherish him, and maintain him, nevertheless,” said the citizen; “for believe my grey hairs, that affection and fidelity are now rarer qualities in a servitor, than when the world was younger.
For the cheer, my lord, a mess of white broth, a fat capon well larded, a dish of beef collops for auld Scotland&#39;s sake, and it may be a cup of right old wine, that was barrelled before Scotland and England were one nation--Then for company, one or two of our own loving countrymen--and maybe my housewife may find out a bonny Scots lass or so.” “I would accept your courtesy, Master Heriot,” said Nigel, “but I hear the city ladies of London like to see a man gallant--I would not like to let down a Scottish nobleman in their ideas, as doubtless you have said the best of our poor country, and I rather lack the means of bravery for the present.” “My lord, your frankness leads me a step farther,” said Master George.
My husband is as wise, and very near as old, as yourself; and if I please him, it is well enough; and though he is not just so rich just now as some folks, yet I hope to see him ride upon his moyle, with a foot-cloth, and have his two blue-coats after him, as well as they do.” CHAPTER V Wherefore come ye not to court?
Certain &#39;tis the rarest sport; There are silks and jewels glistening, Prattling fools and wise men listening, Bullies among brave men justling, Beggars amongst nobles bustling; Low-breath&#39;d talkers, minion lispers, Cutting honest throats by whispers; Wherefore come ye not to court?
And now, friend, will you tell me, like a Christian man, if you will dine with me to-morrow at noon, and bring pretty Mistress Margaret, my god-daughter, with you, to meet with our noble young countryman, the Lord of Glenvarloch?” “The young Lord of Glenvarloch!” said the old mechanist; “wi&#39; aw my heart, and blithe I will be to see him again.
He was deeply learned, without possessing useful knowledge; sagacious in many individual cases, without having real wisdom; fond of his power, and desirous to maintain and augment it, yet willing to resign the direction of that, and of himself, to the most unworthy favourites; a big and bold asserter of his rights in words, yet one who tamely saw them trampled on in deeds; a lover of negotiations, in which he was always outwitted; and one who feared war, where conquest might have been easy.
Francis!--why, he was a fighting fule, man,--a mere fighting fule,--got himsell ta&#39;en at Pavia, like our ain David at Durham lang syne;--if they could hae sent him Solomon&#39;s wit, and love of peace, and godliness, they wad hae dune him a better turn.
And, first, see you, sir--ye shall approach the presence of majesty thus,--shadowing your eyes with your hand, to testify that you are in the presence of the Vice-gerent of Heaven.--Vera weel, George, that is done in a comely manner.--Then, sir, ye sail kneel, and make as if ye would kiss the hem of our garment, the latch of our shoe, or such like.--Very weel enacted--whilk we, as being willing to be debonair and pleasing towards our lieges, prevent thus,--and motion to you to rise;--whilk, having a boon to ask, as yet you obey not, but, gliding your hand into your pouch, bring forth your Supplication, and place it reverentially in our open palm.” The goldsmith, who had complied with great accuracy with all the prescribed points of the ceremonial, here completed it, to James&#39;s no small astonishment, by placing in his hand the petition of the Lord of Glenvarloch.
But, troth, Steenie loves me so dearly, that he cares not that any one should ask favours of me but himself.--Maxwell,” (for the usher had re-entered after having carried off the plate,) “get into the ante-chamber wi&#39; your lang lugs.--In conscience, Geordie, I think as that thou hast been mine ain auld fiduciary, and wert my goldsmith when I might say with the Ethnic poet--_Non mea renidet in domo lacunar_--for, faith, they had pillaged my mither&#39;s auld house sae, that beechen bickers, and treen trenchers, and latten platters, were whiles the best at our board, and glad we were of something to put on them, without quarrelling with the metal of the dishes.
He stood whiles against us, that Lord Randal Olifaunt of Glenvarloch, but he was a loving and a leal subject in the main.
an it please your Majesty,” said the goldsmith, shaking his head, “it is the poor young nobleman&#39;s extreme necessity, and not his will, that makes him importunate; for he must have money, and that briefly, to discharge a debt due to Peregrine Peterson, Conservator of the Privileges at Campvere, or his haill hereditary barony and estate of Glenvarloch will be evicted in virtue of an unredeemed wadset.” “How say ye, man--how say ye?” exclaimed the king, impatiently; “the carle of a Conservator, the son of a Low-Dutch skipper, evict the auld estate and lordship of the house of Olifaunt?--God&#39;s bread, man, that maun not be--we maun suspend the diligence by writ of favour, or otherwise.” “I doubt that may hardly be,” answered the citizen, “if it please your Majesty; your learned counsel in the law of Scotland advise, that there is no remeid but in paying the money.” “Ud&#39;s fish,” said the king, “let him keep haud by the strong hand against the carle, until we can take some order about his affairs.” “Alas!” insisted the goldsmith, “if it like your Majesty, your own pacific government, and your doing of equal justice to all men, has made main force a kittle line to walk by, unless just within the bounds of the Highlands.” “Well--weel--weel, man,” said the perplexed monarch, whose ideas of justice, expedience, and convenience, became on such occasions strangely embroiled; “just it is we should pay our debts, that the young man may pay his; and he must be paid, and _in verbo regis_ he shall be paid--but how to come by the siller, man, is a difficult chapter--ye maun try the city, Geordie.” “To say the truth,” answered Heriot, “please your gracious Majesty, what betwixt loans and benevolences, and subsidies, the city is at this present----” “Donna tell me of what the city is,” said King James; “our Exchequer is as dry as Dean Giles&#39;s discourses on the penitentiary psalms--_Ex nihilo nihil fit_--It&#39;s ill taking the breeks aff a wild Highlandman--they that come to me for siller, should tell me how to come by it--the city ye maun try, Heriot; and donna think to be called Jingling Geordie for nothing--and _in verbo regis_ I will pay the lad if you get me the loan--I wonnot haggle on the terms; and, between you and me, Geordie, we will redeem the brave auld estate of Glenvarloch.--But wherefore comes not the young lord to Court, Heriot--is he comely--is he presentable in the presence?” “No one can be more so,” said George Heriot; “but----” “Ay, I understand ye,” said his Majesty--“I understand ye--_Res angusta domi_--puir lad-puir lad!--and his father a right true leal Scots heart, though stiff in some opinions.
CHAPTER VI O I do know him--tis the mouldy lemon Which our court wits will wet their lips withal, When they would sauce their honied conversation With somewhat sharper flavour--Marry sir, That virtue&#39;s wellnigh left him--all the juice That was so sharp and poignant, is squeezed out, While the poor rind, although as sour as ever, Must season soon the draff we give our grunters, For two legg&#39;d things are weary on&#39;t.

It pressed on Nigel&#39;s heart, that he himself, though he could not conceive how, nor why, might be the original cause of the resentment of the Duke against his benefactor.
Mistress Margaret, her body-guard of &#39;prentices being in readiness, plucked her father by the sleeve, and, rescuing him from a brown study, (whether referring to the wheels of Time, or to that of Fortune, is uncertain,) wished good-night to her friend Mrs. Judith, and received her godfather&#39;s blessing, who, at the same time, put upon her slender finger a ring of much taste and some value; for he seldom suffered her to leave him without some token of his affection.
On the subsequent day he goes to Theobald&#39;s, where he is so much occupied with hunting and other pleasures, that he cares not to be intruded on.” “I shall be in all outward readiness to pay my duty,” said the young nobleman, “yet I have little heart to do it.
wha can ken, if it please your lordship, whether sic prayers as the Southron read out of their auld blethering black mess-book there, may not be as powerful to invite fiends, as a right red-het prayer warm fraw the heart, may be powerful to drive them away, even as the Evil Spirit was driven by he smell of the fish&#39;s liver from the bridal-chamber of Sara, the daughter of Raguel?
As little as a ghost with a lantern, I trow.” “What reason,” repeated Nigel, “can a creature, so young and so beautiful, have already habitually to contemplate her bed of last-long rest?” “In troth, I kenna, my lord,” answered Moniplies; “but there is the coffin, as they told me who have seen it: it is made of heben-wood, with silver nails, and lined all through with three-piled damask, might serve a princess to rest in.” “Singular,” said Nigel, whose brain, like that of most active young spirits, was easily caught by the singular and the romantic; “does she not eat with the family?” “Who!--she!”--exclaimed Moniplies, as if surprised at the question; “they would need a lang spoon would sup with her, I trow.
She could contrive an interview for lovers who could show proper reasons for meeting privately; she could relieve the frail fair one of the burden of a guilty passion, and perhaps establish the hopeful offspring of unlicensed love as the heir of some family whose love was lawful, but where an heir had not followed the union.
So much also was she supposed to know of life and its labyrinths, that she was the willing confidant of half the loving couples in the vicinity, most of whom used to communicate their secrets to, and receive their counsel from, Dame Ursley.
“Why, Dame Ursley--why, wife, I say--why, dame--why, love, you are wanted more than a strop for a blunt razor--why, dame--” “I would some one would draw a razor across thy windpipe, thou bawling ass!” said the dame to herself, in the first moment of irritation against her clamorous helpmate; and then called aloud,--“Why, what is the matter, Master Suddlechop?
I am just going to slip into bed; I have been daggled to and fro the whole day.” “Nay, sweetheart, it is not me,” said the patient Benjamin, “but the Scots laundry-maid from neighbour Ramsay&#39;s, who must speak with you incontinent.” At the word sweetheart, Dame Ursley cast a wistful look at the mess which was stewed to a second in the stewpan, and then replied, with a sigh,--“Bid Scots Jenny come up, Master Suddlechop.
I have been marched from Temple Bar to Whitechapel, on the matter of a pinmaker&#39;s wife having pricked her fingers--marry, her husband that made the weapon might have salved the wound.--And here is this fantastic ape, pretty Mistress Marget, forsooth--such a beauty as I could make of a Dutch doll, and as fantastic, and humorous, and conceited, as if she were a duchess.
“Go your ways down to the kitchen with Wilsa, good Mistress Jenny,” said Dame Ursula, who was used to all sorts of freaks, on the part of her patients or clients, whichever they might be termed; “put the stewpan and the porringer by the fireside, and go down below--I must speak to my pretty love, Mistress Margaret, by myself--and there is not a bachelor betwixt this and Bow but will envy me the privilege.” The attendants retired as directed, and Dame Ursula, having availed herself of the embers of charcoal, to place her stewpan to the best advantage, drew herself as close as she could to her patient, and began in a low, soothing, and confidential tone of voice, to inquire what ailed her pretty flower of neighbours.
“And who was it, then?” said Ursula; “for if I had not been sent for, I had not been here at this time of night, I promise you!” “It was the old Scotch fool Jenny, who did it out of her own head, I suppose,” said Margaret; “for she has been stunning me these two hours about you and Mother Redcap.” “Me and Mother Redcap!” said Dame Ursula, “an old fool indeed, that couples folk up so.--But come, come, my sweet little neighbour, Jenny is no such fool after all; she knows young folks want more and better advice than her own, and she knows, too, where to find it for them; so you must take heart of grace, my pretty maiden, and tell me what you are moping about, and then let Dame Ursula alone for finding out a cure.” “Nay, an ye be so wise, Mother Ursula,” replied the girl, “you may guess what I ail without my telling you.” “Ay, ay, child,” answered the complaisant matron, “no one can play better than I at the good old game of What is my thought like?
we are angry, are we?” said the beauty; “and pray, Madam Ursula, how come you, that are not so many years older than me, to talk about such nonsense to me, who am so many years younger, and who yet have too much sense to care about head-gears and Islington?” “Well, well, young mistress,” said the sage counsellor, rising, “I perceive I can be of no use here; and methinks, since you know your own matters so much better than other people do, you might dispense with disturbing folks at midnight to ask their advice.” “Why, now you are angry, mother,” said Margaret, detaining her; “this comes of your coming out at eventide without eating your supper--I never heard you utter a cross word after you had finished your little morsel.--Here, Janet, a trencher and salt for Dame Ursula;--and what have you in that porringer, dame?--Filthy clammy ale, as I would live--Let Janet fling it out of the window, or keep it for my father&#39;s morning draught; and she shall bring you the pottle of sack that was set ready for him--good man, he will never find out the difference, for ale will wash down his dusty calculations quite as well as wine.” “Truly, sweetheart, I am of your opinion,” said Dame Ursula, whose temporary displeasure vanished at once before these preparations for good cheer; and so, settling herself on the great easy-chair, with a three-legged table before her, she began to dispatch, with good appetite, the little delicate dish which she had prepared for herself.
“At least pledge me in a glass of sack,” said Dame Ursula; “I have heard my grandame say, that before the gospellers came in, the old Catholic father confessors and their penitents always had a cup of sack together before confession; and you are my penitent.” “I shall drink no sack, I am sure,” said Margaret; “and I told you before, that if you cannot find out what ails me, I shall never have the heart to tell it.” So saying, she turned away from Dame Ursula once more, and resumed her musing posture, with her hand on her elbow, and her back, at least one shoulder, turned towards her confidant.
“And why pshaw at my Lord Mayor, sweetheart?
“There dined with us, I say,” continued Margaret, without regarding the interruption, “a nobleman--a Scottish nobleman.” “Now Our Lady keep her!” said the confidant, “she is quite frantic!--heard ever any one of a watchmaker&#39;s daughter falling in love with a nobleman--and a Scots nobleman, to make the matter complete, who are all as proud as Lucifer, and as poor as Job?--A Scots nobleman, quotha?
know ye not--But blisters on my tongue, it runs too fast for my wit--enough to say, that you had better make your bridal-bed under a falling house, than think of young Glenvarloch.” “He IS unfortunate then?” said Margaret; “I knew it--I divined it--there was sorrow in his voice when he said even what was gay--there was a touch of misfortune in his melancholy smile--he had not thus clung to my thoughts had I seen him in all the mid-day glare of prosperity.” “Romances have cracked her brain!” said Dame Ursula; “she is a castaway girl--utterly distraught--loves a Scots lord--and likes him the better for being unfortunate!
Such a sight, sweetheart, will make one loath to meddle with matters that are too hot or heavy for their handling.” “Out, you fool!” answered Mistress Margaret; “am I one to speak to you about such criminal practices as that wretch died for?
All I desire of you is, to get me precise knowledge of what affair brings this young nobleman to Court.” “And when you have his secret,” said Ursula, “what will it avail you, sweetheart?--and yet I would do your errand, if you could do as much for me.” “And what is it you would have of me?” said Mistress Margaret.
But thou knowest that I have a fortune, of my own, which must at no distant day come under my own management--think of some other recompense.” “Ay, that I well know,” said the counsellor--“it is that two hundred per year, with your father&#39;s indulgence, that makes you so wilful, sweetheart.” “It may be so,”--said Margaret Ramsay; “meanwhile, do you serve me truly, and here is a ring of value in pledge, that when my fortune is in my own hand, I will redeem the token with fifty broad pieces of gold.” “Fifty broad pieces of gold!” repeated the dame; “and this ring, which is a right fair one, in token you fail not of your word!--Well, sweetheart, if I must put my throat in peril, I am sure I cannot risk it for a friend more generous than you; and I would not think of more than the pleasure of serving you, only Benjamin gets more idle every day, and our family----” “Say no more of it,” said Margaret; “we understand each other.
And, once more, I commend you to your pillow, my pearl of pearls, and Marguerite of Marguerites!” So saying, she kissed the reluctant cheek of her young friend, or patroness, and took her departure with the light and stealthy pace of one accustomed to accommodate her footsteps to the purposes of dispatch and secrecy.
CHAPTER IX So pitiful a thing is suitor&#39;s state!
Full little knowest thou, that hast not tried, What hell it is, in sueing long to bide: To lose good days that might be better spent; To waste long nights in pensive discontent; To speed to-day, to be put back to-morrow; To feed on hope, to pine with fear and sorrow; To have thy Prince&#39;s grace, yet want her Peers&#39;; To have thy asking, yet wait many years; To fret thy soul with crosses and with cares-- To eat thy heart through comfortless despairs.
The young man&#39;s heart beat high and thick within him as he came into the royal apartments.
“And is it even so, man?” said he; “and can no single man, were it but for the rarity of the case, ever come up frae Scotland, excepting EX PROPOSITO--on set purpose, to see what he can make out of his loving sovereign?
“Ay, marry will I--marry will I,” said the king; “but follow me this way, man, where we may be more private.” He led Lord Huntinglen with rather a hurried step through the courtiers, all of whom gazed earnestly on this unwonted scene, as is the fashion of all Courts on similar occasions.
I think you will grant now that I am none of those?” “You are my own native and noble prince,” said Huntinglen, as he knelt to kiss the royal hand--“just and generous, whenever you listen to the workings of your own heart.” “Ay, ay,” said the king, laughing good-naturedly, as he raised his faithful servant from the ground, “that is what ye all say when I do any thing to please ye.
You are become, I understand, a solicitor of suits--a promoter--an undertaker--a fautor of court suitors of merit and quality, who chance to be pennyless.
“He proposes so, I think,” answered Lord Huntinglen, relapsed into his reverie for a minute or two, and then addressed Nigel somewhat abruptly-- “My young friend, when you attain possession of your inheritance, as I hope you soon will, I trust you will not add one to the idle followers of the Court, but reside on your patrimonial estate, cherish your ancient tenants, relieve and assist your poor kinsmen, protect the poor against subaltern oppression, and do what our fathers used to do, with fewer lights and with less means than we have.” “And yet the advice to keep the country,” said Heriot, “comes from an ancient and constant ornament of the Court.” “From an old courtier, indeed,” said the earl, “and the first of my family that could so write himself--my grey beard falls on a cambric ruff and a silken doublet--my father&#39;s descended upon a buff coat and a breast-plate.
I would not that those days of battle returned; but I should love well to make the oaks of my old forest of Dalgarno ring once more with halloo, and horn, and hound, and to have the old stone-arched hall return the hearty shout of my vassals and tenants, as the bicker and the quaigh walked their rounds amongst them.
While the old earl presented his young acquaintance Lord Glenvarloch to his son, as one whom he would have him love and honour, Nigel marked the countenance of Lord Dalgarno closely, to see if he could detect aught of that secret dislike which the king had, in one of his broken expostulations, seemed to intimate, as arising from a clashing of interests betwixt his new friend and the great Buckingham.
His term of sincere mourning, joined to injured pride, and the swelling of the heart under unexpected and undeserved misfortune, together with the uncertainty attending the issue of his affairs, had induced the young Lord of Glenvarloch to live, while in Scotland, in a very private and reserved manner.
Why, my liefest and dearest lord, you, a young and handsome fellow, with high birth, a title, and the name of an estate, so well received by the king at your first starting, as makes your further progress scarce matter of doubt, if you know how to improve it--for the king has already said you are a &#39;braw lad, and well studied in the more humane letters&#39;--you, too, whom all the women, and the very marked beauties of the Court, desire to see, because you came from Leyden, were born in Scotland, and have gained a hard-contested suit in England--you, I say, with a person like a prince, an eye of fire, and a wit as quick, to think of throwing your cards on the table when the game is in your very hand, running back to the frozen north, and marrying--let me see--a tall, stalking, blue-eyed, fair-skinned bony wench, with eighteen quarters in her scutcheon, a sort of Lot&#39;s wife, newly descended from her pedestal, and with her to shut yourself up in your tapestried chamber!
that you should have gone to a wealthy goldsmith for your habit--why, I could have brought you to an honest, confiding tailor, who should have furnished you with half-a-dozen, merely for love of the little word, &#39;lordship,&#39; which you place before your name;--and then your goldsmith, if he be really a friendly goldsmith, should have equipped you with such a purse of fair rose-nobles as would have bought you thrice as many suits, or done better things for you.” “I do not understand these fashions, my lord,” said Nigel, his displeasure mastering his shame; “were I to attend the Court of my sovereign, it should be when I could maintain, without shifting or borrowing, the dress and retinue which my rank requires.” “Which my rank requires!” said Lord Dalgarno, repeating his last words; “that, now, is as good as if my father had spoke it.
I fancy you would love to move to Court with him, followed by a round score of old blue-bottles, with white heads and red noses, with bucklers and broadswords, which their hands, trembling betwixt age and strong waters, can make no use of--as many huge silver badges on their arms, to show whose fools they are, as would furnish forth a court cupboard of plate--rogues fit for nothing but to fill our ante-chambers with the flavour of onions and genievre--pah!” “The poor knaves!” said Lord Glenvarloch; “they have served your father, it may be, in the wars.
In the Court horizon Buckingham is Lord of the Ascendant, and as he is adverse or favouring, so sinks or rises the fortune of a suitor.
And, ever and anon, those flashes of spirit and honour crossed his conversation, which seemed to intimate, that, when stirred to action by some adequate motive, Lord Dalgarno would prove something very different from the court-haunting and ease-loving voluptuary, which he was pleased to represent as his chosen character.
I love my father--I love him dearly--and I respect him, too, though I respect not many things; a trustier old Trojan never belted a broadsword by a loop of leather.
His pretensions to quality were supported by a feathered hat, a long rapier, and a suit of embroidered taffeta, not much the worse for wear, in the extreme fashion of the Parisian court, and fluttering like a Maypole with many knots of ribbon, of which it was computed he bore at least five hundred yards about his person.
When Nigel entered the mansion of this eminent person, which had been but of late the residence of a great Baron of Queen Elizabeth&#39;s court, who had retired to his manors in the country on the death of that princess, he was surprised at the extent of the accommodation which it afforded, and the number of guests who were already assembled.
Yes, I have memory of him--le pere de milor apparemment-we were vera intimate when I was at Oly Root with Monsieur de la Motte--I did often play at tennis vit Milor Kenfarloque at L&#39;Abbaie d&#39;Oly Root--il etoit meme plus fort que moi--Ah le beaucoup de revers qu&#39;il avoit!--I have memory, too that he was among the pretty girls--ah, un vrai diable dechaine--Aha!
O, if a band of the honest fellows I have seen were once to come near that cuckoo&#39;s nest of theirs!” “A cuckoo&#39;s nest!-and that said of the city of London!” said a gallant who sat on the opposite side of the table, and who, wearing a splendid and fashionable dress, seemed yet scarce at home in it--“I will not brook to hear that repeated.” “What!” said the soldier, bending a most terrific frown from a pair of broad black eyebrows, handling the hilt of his weapon with one hand, and twirling with the other his huge mustaches; “will you quarrel for your city?” “Ay, marry will I,” replied the other.
It is not, however, of him I mean now to speak; but I come to pray you, of dear love, to row up with me as far as Richmond, where two or three of the gallants whom you saw yesterday, mean to give music and syllabubs to a set of beauties, with some curious bright eyes among them--such, I promise you, as might win an astrologer from his worship of the galaxy.
But as we shall not meet for some time, I must commit to your own wisdom the farther prosecution of this matter.” And thus they took a kind and affectionate leave of each other.
There was all the linen, too, which she had bought on purpose--But Heaven&#39;s will be done--she was resigned.” Everybody likes marks of personal attachment; and Nigel, whose heart really smote him, as if in his rising fortunes he were disdaining the lowly accommodations and the civilities of the humble friends which had been but lately actual favours, failed not by every assurance in his power, and by as liberal payment as they could be prevailed upon to accept, to alleviate the soreness of their feelings at his departure; and a parting kiss from the fair lips of his hostess sealed his forgiveness.
hey, boy--here, sir, here!-- He&#39;s gone and off, but he&#39;ll be home before us;-- &#39;Tis the most wayward cur e&#39;er mumbled bone, Or dogg&#39;d a master&#39;s footstep.--Bingo loves me Better than ever beggar loved his alms; Yet, when he takes such humour, you may coax Sweet Mistress Fantasy, your worship&#39;s mistress, Out of her sullen moods, as soon as Bingo.
“I play with whom I please, but I will only play for what stake I please.” “That is just what they say, my lord,” said the unmerciful Richie, whose natural love of lecturing, as well as his bluntness of feeling, prevented him from having any idea of the pain which he was inflicting on his master; “these are even their own very words.
Then his pride and self-love suggested, that, on the other hand, Richie, with all his good intentions, was little better than a conceited, pragmatical domestic, who seemed disposed rather to play the tutor than the lackey, and who, out of sheer love, as he alleged, to his master&#39;s person, assumed the privilege of interfering with, and controlling, his actions, besides rendering him ridiculous in the gay world, from the antiquated formality, and intrusive presumption, of his manners.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“With all my heart,” said the knight; “I have got little by a knight&#39;s service in the Court; and the last time I was at the ordinary, I lost four angels.” “May I pray of you, Sir Mungo, to let me know,” said Nigel, “the names of those who thus make free with the character of one who can be but little known to them, and who never injured any of them?” “Have I not told you already,” answered Sir Mungo, “that the king said something to that effect--so did the Prince too;--and such being the case, ye may take it on your corporal oath, that every man in the circle who was not silent, sung the same song as they did.” “You said but now,” replied Glenvarloch, “that Lord Dalgarno interfered in my behalf.” “In good troth did he,” answered Sir Mungo, with a sneer; “but the young nobleman was soon borne down--by token, he had something of a catarrh, and spoke as hoarse as a roopit raven.
I wish you weel through, my lord, but it is an unequal fight.” So saying, he turned and limped away; often looking back, however, as if his natural spirit, even in its present subdued state, aided by his love of contradiction and of debate, rendered him unwilling to adopt the course necessary for his own security.
Look to it, every one who bars my access; I have a heart to feel the injury, A hand to night myself, and, by my honour, That hand shall grasp what grey-beard Law denies me.
The person I struck was Lord Dalgarno, whom you have seen at Beaujeu&#39;s.” “A follower and favourite of the Duke of Buckingham!--It is a most unhappy chance, my lord; but my heart was formed in England, and cannot bear to see a young nobleman borne down, as you are like to be.
Was it ever heard there was a game at gleek at the ordinary before, without counting tiddy?--marry quep upon his lordship!--Every man who comes there with his purse in his hand, is as free to make new laws as he, I hope, since touch pot touch penny makes every man equal.” As Master Lowestoffe ran over this jargon of the gaming-table, Lord Glenvarloch was both ashamed and mortified, and felt a severe pang of aristocratic pride, when he concluded in the sweeping clause that the dice, like the grave, levelled those distinguishing points of society, to which Nigel&#39;s early prejudices clung perhaps but too fondly.
He knows the step of a dun from that of a client, when it reaches the very bottom of the staircase; can tell the trip of a pretty wench from the step of a bencher, when at the upper end of the court; and is, take him all in all--But I see your lordship is anxious--May I press another cup of my kind grandmother&#39;s cordial, or will you allow me to show you my wardrobe, and act as your valet or groom of the chamber?” Lord Glenvarloch hesitated not to acknowledge that he was painfully sensible of his present situation, and anxious to do what must needs be done for his extrication.
Guided by one of these blinking Ganymedes, they entered a room, where the feeble rays of the sun were almost wholly eclipsed by volumes of tobacco-smoke, rolled from the tubes of the company, while out of the cloudy sanctuary arose the old chant of-- “Old Sir Simon the King, And old Sir Simon the King, With his malmsey nose, And his ale-dropped hose, And sing hey ding-a-ding-ding.” Duke Hildebrod, who himself condescended to chant this ditty to his loving subjects, was a monstrously fat old man, with only one eye; and a nose which bore evidence to the frequency, strength, and depth of his potations.
“The person,” he said, “who hath now had the assurance to propose himself as a candidate for the privileges and immunities of this honourable society, is, in plain terms, a beggarly Scot, and we have enough of these locusts in London already--if we admit such palmer-worms and caterpillars to the Sanctuary, we shall soon have the whole nation.” “We are not entitled to inquire,” said Duke Hildebrod, “whether he be Scot, or French, or English; seeing he has honourably laid down his garnish, he is entitled to our protection.” “Word of denial, most Sovereign Duke,” replied the parson, “I ask him no questions--his speech betrayeth him--he is a Galilean--and his garnish is forfeited for his assurance in coming within this our realm; and I call on you, Sir Duke, to put the laws in force against him!” The Templar here rose, and was about to interrupt the deliberations of the court, when the Duke gravely assured him that he should be heard in behalf of his friend, so soon as the council had finished their deliberations.
The words of, kind heart!
But she knew her brother so well, and loved him so dearly, that his will, once expressed, might be truly said to become her own.
Some opined that the wealthy goldsmith was about to turn papist, and re-establish Lady Foljambe&#39;s nunnery--others that he was going mad--others that he was either going to marry, or to do worse.
It was also ascertained that these visits scarcely ever exceeded an hour in length, and were usually only repeated once a week, an intercourse too brief and too long interrupted, to render it probable that love was the bond of their union.
But though, from these circumstances, the city-beauty had become as wilful, as capricious, and as affected, as unlimited indulgence seldom fails to render those to whom it is extended; and although she exhibited upon many occasions that affectation of extreme shyness, silence, and reserve, which misses in their teens are apt to take for an amiable modesty; and, upon others, a considerable portion of that flippancy, which youth sometimes confounds with wit, Mistress Margaret had much real shrewdness and judgment, which wanted only opportunities of observation to refine it--a lively, good-humoured, playful disposition, and an excellent heart.
Her acquired follies were much increased by reading plays and romances, to which she devoted a great deal of her time, and from which she adopted ideas as different as possible from those which she might have obtained from the invaluable and affectionate instructions of an excellent mother; and the freaks of which she was sometimes guilty, rendered her not unjustly liable to the charge of affectation and coquetry.
The habitual awe with which she regarded this singular personage, induced Mistress Margaret, though by no means delighting in contradiction or reproof, to listen with patience to her admonitions, and to make full allowance for the good intentions of the patroness by whom they were bestowed; although in her heart she could hardly conceive how Madame Hermione, who never stirred from the Foljambe apartments, should think of teaching knowledge of the world to one who walked twice a-week between Temple Bar and Lombard Street, besides parading in the Park every Sunday that proved to be fair weather.
This were a leaguer-lass to love a soldier, To bind his wounds, and kiss his bloody brow, And sing a roundel as she help&#39;d to arm him, Though the rough foeman&#39;s drums were beat so nigh, They seem&#39;d to bear the burden.
You have seen them in the garden bloom thrice, but you have seen them fade thrice also; now, Monna Paula&#39;s will remain in blow for ever--they will fear neither frost nor tempest.” “True, madam,” answered Mistress Margaret; “but neither have they life or odour.” “That, little one,” replied the recluse, “is to compare a life agitated by hope and fear, and chequered with success and disappointment, and fevered by the effects of love and hatred, a life of passion and of feeling, saddened and shortened by its exhausting alternations, to a calm and tranquil existence, animated but by a sense of duties, and only employed, during its smooth and quiet course, in the unwearied discharge of them.
I will wager you have suffered yonder gay young apprentice to sit too near your heart.
Be open-hearted, my love--your godfather will soon return, and we will take him into our consultations.
“When did you ever hear that misplaced love brought any thing but wretchedness?
Seek a match among your equals, Margaret, and escape the countless kinds of risk and misery that must attend an affection beyond your degree.--Why do you smile, maiden?
Dame Ursley told me the very same thing which your ladyship has but now uttered; only you, madam, talk of countless misery, and Dame Ursley spoke of the gallows, and Mistress Turner, who was hanged upon it.” “Indeed?” answered the Lady Hermione; “and who may Dame Ursley be, that your wise choice has associated with me in the difficult task of advising a fool?” “The barber&#39;s wife at next door, madam,” answered Margaret, with feigned simplicity, but far from being sorry at heart, that she had found an indirect mode of mortifying her monitress.
And tell me how you come to suppose, that you have fixed your heart unalterably upon a man whom you have seen, as I think, but once.” “I have seen him oftener,” said the damsel, looking down; “but I have only spoken to him once.
It is not only dangerous, but even unbecoming and unmaidenly.” “I knew you would say that also,” said Margaret, with more meekness and patience than she usually showed on receiving reproof; “but, God knows, my heart acquits me of every other feeling save that of the wish to assist this most innocent and betrayed man.--I contrived to send him warning of his friend&#39;s falsehood;--alas!
“I will never see him more--but I shall have saved him, and the thought will make me happy.” “A cold conclusion to so bold and warm a flame,” said the lady, with a smile which seemed to intimate incredulity.
“I have, with the command of a moderate sum,” answered Margaret Ramsay, “the power of baffling all his enemies--of eluding the passion of the irritated king--the colder but more determined displeasure of the prince--the vindictive spirit of Buckingham, so hastily directed against whomsoever crosses the path of his ambition--the cold concentrated malice of Lord Dalgarno--all, I can baffle them all!” “But is this to be done without your own personal risk, Margaret?” replied the lady; “for, be your purpose what it will, you are not to peril your own reputation or person, in the romantic attempt of serving another; and I, maiden, am answerable to your godfather,--to your benefactor, and my own,--not to aid you in any dangerous or unworthy enterprise.” “Depend upon my word,--my oath,--dearest lady,” replied the supplicant, “that I will act by the agency of others, and do not myself design to mingle in any enterprise in which my appearance might be either perilous or unwomanly.” “I know not what to do,” said the Lady Hermione; “it is perhaps incautious and inconsiderate in me to aid so wild a project; yet the end seems honourable, if the means be sure--what is the penalty if he fall into their power?” “Alas, alas!
My life has been one of strange seclusion, and I am totally unacquainted with the practical ways of this world--an ignorance which I know cannot be remedied by mere reading.--I fear I am doing wrong to you, and perhaps to the laws of the country which affords me refuge, by thus indulging you; and yet there is something in my heart which cannot resist your entreaties.” “O, listen to it--listen to it, dear, generous lady!” said Margaret, throwing herself on her knees and grasping those of her benefactress and looking in that attitude like a beautiful mortal in the act of supplicating her tutelary angel; “the laws of men are but the injunctions of mortality, but what the heart prompts is the echo of the voice from heaven within us.” “Rise, rise, maiden,” said Hermione; “you affect me more than I thought I could have been moved by aught that should approach me.
It seems to be as if a childish girl had at once shot up into deep-thinking and impassioned woman, ready to make exertions alike, and sacrifices, with all that vain devotion to a favourite object of affection, which is often so basely rewarded.” The Lady Hermione sighed bitterly, and Monna Paula entered ere the conversation proceeded farther.
“You are very kind, madam--very good,” said the poor little Margaret, while the anxious trembling of her lip and of her hand showed all that sickening agitation of the heart which arises from hope deferred.
And even at this agitating moment, although she ceased not to listen with an anxious ear and throbbing heart for the sound of Monna Paula&#39;s returning footsteps, she nevertheless, as gratitude and policy, as well as a portion of curiosity dictated, composed herself, in appearance at least, to the strictest attention to the Lady Hermione, and thanked her with humility for the high confidence she was pleased to repose in her.
My maternal grandfather, a cadet of that house of Glenvarloch, had followed the fortunes of an unhappy fugitive, Francis Earl of Bothwell, who, after showing his miseries in many a foreign court, at length settled in Spain upon a miserable pension, which he earned by conforming to the Catholic faith.
“It was at Barcelona that he became acquainted with my mother, loved her, and married her; they differed in faith, but they agreed in affection.
In public I conformed to the docterins and ceremonial of the Church of Rome; but my mother, by whom these were regarded with horror, privately trained me up in those of the reformed religion; and my father, either indifferent in the matter, or unwilling to distress the woman whom he loved, overlooked or connived at my secretly joining in her devotions.
This man, so noble, so fairly formed, so gifted, and so brave--this villain, for that, Margaret, was his fittest name, spoke of love to me, and I listened---Could I suspect his sincerity?
My lover might think, perhaps, as my mother was desirous the world at large should believe, that almost our whole fortune depended on the precarious suit which we had come to Madrid to prosecute--a belief which she had countenanced out of policy, being well aware that a knowledge of my father&#39;s having remitted such a large part of his fortune to England, would in no shape aid the recovery of further sums in the Spanish courts.
He had himself interest sufficient to have obtained a decision in our favour in the courts, and my fortune, reckoning only what was in Spain, would then have been no inconsiderable sum.
“My lover retired in passion; and I remained to weep and murmur against fortune, and--I will confess my fault--against my affectionate parent.
“While I was in this humour, my lover sought a renewal of our intercourse.
At length we were secretly married--so far did my blinded passion hurry me.
My lover had secured the assistance of a clergyman of the English church.
Let me do the faithful creature justice--She conjured me to suspend my purpose till my mother&#39;s death should permit us to celebrate our marriage openly; but the entreaties of my lover, and my own wayward passion, prevailed over her remonstrances.
But the shelter of her name and roof afforded us the means of frequently meeting, and the love of my husband seemed as sincere and as unbounded as my own.
I avowed my marriage, to justify the situation in which I found myself--I implored the assistance of the Superior to communicate my situation to my husband.
As I was, both from religious principle, and affectionate attachment to my husband, absolutely immovable in my rejection of the veil, I believe--may heaven forgive me if I wrong her--that the Abbess was desirous to make sure of my spoils, by hastening the former event.
The Superior herself was of a high family, to which she owed her situation; but she was said to have disgraced her connexions by her conduct during youth, and now, in advanced age, covetousness and the love of power, a spirit too of severity and cruelty, had succeeded to the thirst after licentious pleasure.
I was easily reconciled to be passive, for, the first fever of spirits which attended the sense of liberation and of gratified affection having passed away, I felt as it were dizzy with the rapid motion; and my utmost exertion was necessary to keep my place on the saddle, until we suddenly (it was now very dark) saw a strong light before us.
His companion approached--kissed my hand, which in the agony of the moment I was scarce sensible of, and followed my husband, attended by one of the domestics.” The tears of Hermione here flowed so fast as to threaten the interruption of her narrative.
I was told a gentleman had expected me for two days--I rushed into the apartment, and, when I expected to embrace my husband--I found myself in the arms of his friend!” “The villain!” exclaimed Margaret, whose anxiety had, in spite of herself, been a moment suspended by the narrative of the lady.
He, Margaret, for whom I had sacrificed all--whose love and whose memory were dearer to me than my freedom, when I was in the convent--than my life, when I was on my perilous journey--had taken his measures to shake me off, and transfer me, as a privileged wanton, to the protection of his libertine friend.
At first the stranger laughed at my tears and my agony, as the hysterical passion of a deluded and overreached wanton, or the wily affection of a courtezan.
My claim of marriage he laughed at, assuring me he knew it was a mere farce required by me, and submitted to by his friend, to save some reserve of delicacy; and expressed his surprise that I should consider in any other light a ceremony which could be valid neither in Spain nor England, and insultingly offered to remove my scruples, by renewing such a union with me himself.
But, O Margaret, look for no gratitude in return!” The Lady Hermione took the bag of gold from her attendant, and gave it to her young friend, who threw herself into her arms, kissed her on both the pale cheeks, over which the sorrows so newly awakened by her narrative had drawn many tears, then sprung up, wiped her own overflowing eyes, and left the Foljambe apartments with a hasty and resolved step.
But there was a little back-room, used as a private tap-room, which had a separate entrance by a dark and crooked alley, which communicated with Fleet Street, after a circuitous passage through several by-lanes and courts.
Persons of fashion had, by the way, the advantage formerly of being better distinguished from the vulgar than at present; for, what the ancient farthingale and more modern hoop were to court ladies, the sword was to the gentleman; an article of dress, which only rendered those ridiculous who assumed it for the nonce, without being in the habit of wearing it.
He laughed for an instant, half in scorn, and half in gratified vanity, but cast a sullen look on Dame Ursley as he replied to her last words, “You do treat me like a child indeed, when you sing over and over to me a cuckoo song that I care not a copper-filing for.” “Aha!” said Dame Ursley; “that is to say, you care not if you please all, unless you please one--You are a true lover, I warrant, and care not for all the city, from here to Whitechapel, so you could write yourself first in your pretty Peg-a-Ramsay&#39;s good-will.
She loves gentry, the proud Scottish minx, as a Welshman loves cheese, and has her father&#39;s descent from that Duke of Daldevil, or whatsoever she calls him, as close in her heart as gold in a miser&#39;s chest, though she as seldom shows it--and none she will think of, or have, but a gentleman--and a gentleman I have made of thee, Jin Vin, the devil cannot deny that.” “You have made a fool of me,” said poor Jenkin, looking at the sleeve of his jacket.
upon such another scolding jade as yourself.” “I hope to see you ride up Holborn next,” said Dame Ursley, provoked out of all her holiday and sugar-plum expressions, “with a nosegay at your breast, and a parson at your elbow!” “That may well be,” answered Jin Vin, bitterly, “if I walk by your counsels as I have begun by them; but, before that day comes, you shall know that Jin Vin has the brisk boys of Fleet Street still at his wink.--Yes, you jade, you shall be carted for bawd and conjurer, double-dyed in grain, and bing off to Bridewell, with every brass basin betwixt the Bar and Paul&#39;s beating before you, as if the devil were banging them with his beef-hook.” Dame Ursley coloured like scarlet, seized upon the half-emptied flask of cordial, and seemed, by her first gesture, about to hurl it at the head of her adversary; but suddenly, and as if by a strong internal effort, she checked her outrageous resentment, and, putting the bottle to its more legitimate use, filled, with wonderful composure, the two glasses, and, taking up one of them, said, with a smile, which better became her comely and jovial countenance than the fury by which it was animated the moment before-- “Here is to thee, Jin Vin, my lad, in all loving kindness, whatever spite thou bearest to me, that have always been a mother to thee.” Jenkin&#39;s English good-nature could not resist this forcible appeal; he took up the other glass, and lovingly pledged the dame in her cup of reconciliation, and proceeded to make a kind of grumbling apology for his own violence-- “For you know,” he said, “it was you persuaded me to get these fine things, and go to that godless ordinary, and ruffle it with the best, and bring you home all the news; and you said, I, that was the cock of the ward, would soon be the cock of the ordinary, and would win ten times as much at gleek and primero, as I used to do at put and beggar-my-neighbour--and turn up doublets with the dice, as busily as I was wont to trowl down the ninepins in the skittle-ground--and then you said I should bring you such news out of the ordinary as should make us all, when used as you knew how to use it--and now you see what is to come of it all!” “&#39;Tis all true thou sayest, lad,” said the dame; “but thou must have patience.
I am sure I would never have advised you to such a course, but only you had set heart and eye on pretty Mistress Marget, and less would not serve you--and what could I do but advise you to cast your city-slough, and try your luck where folks find fortune?” “Ay, ay--I remember your counsel well,” said Jenkin; “I was to be introduced to her by you when I was perfect in my gallantries, and as rich as the king; and then she was to be surprised to find I was poor Jin Vin, that used to watch, from matin to curfew, for one glance of her eye; and now, instead of that, she has set her soul on this Scottish sparrow-hawk of a lord that won my last tester, and be cursed to him; and so I am bankrupt in love, fortune, and character, before I am out of my time, and all along of you, Mother Midnight.” “Do not call me out of my own name, my dear boy, Jin Vin,” answered Ursula, in a tone betwixt rage and coaxing,--“do not; because I am no saint, but a poor sinful woman, with no more patience than she needs, to carry her through a thousand crosses.
“In troth am I,” said the dame; “and will you call me Mother Midnight now, Jin Vin?” “Mother Midnight!” exclaimed Jenkin, hugging the dame in his transport, and bestowing on her still comely cheek a hearty and not unacceptable smack, that sounded like the report of a pistol,--“Mother Midday, rather, that has risen to light me out of my troubles--a mother more dear than she who bore me; for she, poor soul, only brought me into a world of sin and sorrow, and your timely aid has helped me out of the one and the other.” And the good-natured fellow threw himself back in his chair, and fairly drew his hand across his eyes.
“Why, then, sit up like a man, and wipe thine eyes; and, if thou art pleased with what I have done, I will show thee how thou mayst requite me in the highest degree.” “How?” said Jenkin Vincent, sitting straight up in his chair.--“You would have me, then, do you some service for this friendship of yours?” “Ay, marry would I,” said Dame Ursley; “for you are to know, that though I am right glad to stead you with it, this gold is not mine, but was placed in my hands in order to find a trusty agent, for a certain purpose; and so--But what&#39;s the matter with you?--are you fool enough to be angry because you cannot get a purse of gold for nothing?
“Have you not confessed to me, that Margaret loves him?” “Ay,” answered the dame, “that she thinks she does; but that will not last long.” “And have I not told you but this instant,” replied Jenkin, “that it was this same Glenvarloch that rooked me, at the ordinary, of every penny I had, and made a knave of me to boot, by gaining more than was my own?--O that cursed gold, which Shortyard, the mercer, paid me that morning on accompt, for mending the clock of Saint Stephen&#39;s!
“My money, indeed, I can conceive--that is, if I comply with your proposal; but--my pretty Marget!--how serving this lord, whom she has set her nonsensical head upon, can do me good with her, is far beyond my conception.” “That is because, in simple phrase,” said Dame Ursula, “thou knowest no more of a woman&#39;s heart than doth a Norfolk gosling.
Then you have her secret, and she must treat you with favour and observance, and repose confidence in you, and hold private intercourse with you, till she weeps with one eye for the absent lover whom she is never to see again, and blinks with the other blithely upon him who is in presence; and then if you know not how to improve the relation in which you stand with her, you are not the brisk lively lad that all the world takes you for--Said I well?” “You have spoken like an empress, most mighty Ursula,” said Jenkin Vincent; “and your will shall be obeyed.” “You know Alsatia well?” continued his tutoress.
“No,” replied Ursula, “but Dame Judith is at home--and the strange lady, whom they call Master Heriot&#39;s ghost--she never goes abroad.” “It is very true, Dame Suddlechop,” said Jenkin; “and I believe you have guessed right--they say that lady has coin at will; and if Marget can get a handful of fairy-gold, why, she is free to throw it away at will.” “Ah, Jin Vin,” said the dame, reducing her voice almost to a whisper, “we should not want gold at will neither, could we but read the riddle of that lady!” “They may read it that list,” said Jenkin, “I&#39;ll never pry into what concerns me not--Master George Heriot is a worthy and brave citizen, and an honour to London, and has a right to manage his own household as he likes best.--There was once a talk of rabbling him the fifth of November before the last, because they said he kept a nunnery in his house, like old Lady Foljambe; but Master George is well loved among the &#39;prentices, and we got so many brisk boys of us together as should have rabbled the rabble, had they had but the heart to rise.” “Well, let that pass,” said Ursula; “and now, tell me how you will manage to be absent from shop a day or two, for you must think that this matter will not be ended sooner.” “Why, as to that, I can say nothing,” said Jenkin, “I have always served duly and truly; I have no heart to play truant, and cheat my master of his time as well as his money.” “Nay, but the point is to get back his money for him,” said Ursula, “which he is not likely to see on other conditions.
A sword, musketoon, and a pair of pistols, hung over the chimney, in ostentatious display, as if to intimate that the proprietor would be prompt in the defence of his premises.
There are no such soliloquies in nature, it is true, but unless they were received as a conventional medium of communication betwixt the poet and the audience, we should reduce dramatic authors to the recipe of Master Puff, who makes Lord Burleigh intimate a long train of political reasoning to the audience, by one comprehensive shake of his noddle.
“The Marshalsea?” repeated Lord Glenvarloch; “what of the Marshalsea?” “Why, sir,” said the man, “the poor gentleman is laid up there in lavender, because, they say, his own kind heart led him to scald his fingers with another man&#39;s broth.” Nigel hastily snatched back the letter, broke the seal, joined to the contents his earnest entreaty that he might be instantly acquainted with the cause of his confinement, and added, that, if it arose out of his own unhappy affair, it would be of a brief duration, since he had, even before hearing of a reason which so peremptorily demanded that he should surrender himself, adopted the resolution to do so, as the manliest and most proper course which his ill fortune and imprudence had left in his own power.
The sleeves of his thickset velvet jerkin were polished and shone with grease,--his buff gloves had huge tops, which reached almost to the elbow; his sword-belt of the same materials extended its breadth from his haunchbone to his small ribs, and supported on the one side his large black-hilted back-sword, on the other a dagger of like proportions He paid his compliments to Nigel with that air of predetermined effrontery, which announces that it will not be repelled by any coldness of reception, asked Trapbois how he did, by the familiar title of old Peter Pillory, and then, seizing upon the black-jack, emptied it off at a draught, to the health of the last and youngest freeman of Alsatia, the noble and loving master Nigel Grahame.
When he had set down the empty pitcher and drawn his breath, he began to criticise the liquor which it had lately contained.--“Sufficient single beer, old Pillory--and, as I take it, brewed at the rate of a nutshell of malt to a butt of Thames--as dead as a corpse, too, and yet it went hissing down my throat--bubbling, by Jove, like water upon hot iron.--You left us early, noble Master Grahame, but, good faith, we had a carouse to your honour--we heard _butt_ ring hollow ere we parted; we were as loving as inkle-weavers--we fought, too, to finish off the gawdy.
The man of God bears my sign-manual too, but the Duke made us friends again, and it cost me more sack than I could carry, and all the Rhenish to boot, to pledge the seer in the way of love and reconciliation--But, Caracco!
“Yes, by mine honour have I,” returned the Hector; “they are phrases that a gentleman learns about town.--But perhaps you would like a set at tennis, or a game at balloon--we have an indifferent good court hard by here, and a set of as gentleman-like blades as ever banged leather against brick and mortar.” “I beg to be excused at present,” said Lord Glenvarloch; “and to be plain, among the valuable privileges your society has conferred on me, I hope I may reckon that of being private in my own apartment when I have a mind.” “Your humble servant, sir,” said the captain; “and I thank you for your civility--Jack Colepepper can have enough of company, and thrusts himself on no one.--But perhaps you will like to make a match at skittles?” “I am by no means that way disposed,” replied the young nobleman, “Or to leap a flea--run a snail--match a wherry, eh?” “No--I will do none of these,” answered Nigel.
“Videlicet,” said Colepepper, with a swaggering air, “let us hear the temptation.” “I am tempted to throw you headlong from the window, unless you presently make the best of your way down stairs.” “Throw me from the window?--hell and furies!” exclaimed the captain; “I have confronted twenty crooked sabres at Buda with my single rapier, and shall a chitty-faced, beggarly Scots lordling, speak of me and a window in the same breath?--Stand off, old Pillory, let me make Scotch collops of him--he dies the death!” “For the love of Heaven, gentlemen,” exclaimed the old miser, throwing himself between them, “do not break the peace on any consideration!
But his heart failed, he sheathed his sword, turned his back in gloomy silence, and spoke not until he reached the door, when, turning round, he said, with a deep oath, “If I be not avenged of you for this insolence ere many days go by, I would the gallows had my body and the devil my spirit!” So saying, and with a look where determined spite and malice made his features savagely fierce, though they could not overcome his fear, he turned and left the house.
“He hears me not--he thinks not of me.--Is it not strange that the love of gathering gold should survive the care to preserve both property and life?” “Your father,” said Lord Glenvarloch, who could not help respecting the strong sense and feeling shown by this poor woman, even amidst all her rudeness and severity, “your father seems to have his faculties sufficiently alert when he is in the exercise of his ordinary pursuits and functions.
The bravest man, placed in a situation in which he is surrounded by suspicious persons, and removed from all counsel and assistance, except those afforded by a valiant heart and a strong arm, experiences a sinking of the spirit, a consciousness of abandonment, which for a moment chills his blood, and depresses his natural gallantry of disposition.
“but how is it to be accomplished?” “By making thee a Prince of Peru, my lord of the northern latitudes; propping thine old castle with ingots,--fertilizing thy failing fortunes with gold dust--it shall but cost thee to put thy baron&#39;s coronet for a day or so on the brows of an old Caduca here, the man&#39;s daughter of the house, and thou art master of a mass of treasure that shall do all I have said for thee, and--” “What, you would have me marry this old gentlewoman here, the daughter of mine host?” said Nigel, surprised and angry, yet unable to suppress some desire to laugh.
“Nay, my lord, I would have you marry fifty thousand good sterling pounds; for that, and better, hath old Trapbois hoarded; and thou shall do a deed of mercy in it to the old man, who will lose his golden smelts in some worse way--for now that he is well-nigh past his day of work, his day of payment is like to follow.” “Truly, this is a most courteous offer,” said Lord Glenvarloch; “but may I pray of your candour, most noble duke, to tell me why you dispose of a ward of so much wealth on a stranger like me, who may leave you to-morrow?” “In sooth, my lord,” said the Duke, “that question smacks more of the wit of Beaujeu&#39;s ordinary, than any word I have yet heard your lordship speak, and reason it is you should be answered.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The miser, with a sparkling eye and a trembling hand, clutched fast the proffered coin, and, having balanced the pieces with exquisite pleasure on the extremity of his withered finger, began almost instantly to show that not even the possession of gold can gratify for more than an instant the very heart that is most eager in the pursuit of it.
It was dark, save some pale moonlight from the window; and the ruffian, after firing a pistol without effect, and fighting a traverse or two with his sword, lost heart, made for the window, leaped over it, and escaped.
Think you, the thoughts of my own heart are not enough to distract me, and with such a sight as this before me?
“Token!--ay, marry did he--token enough, an I have not forgot it,” said the fellow; then, giving a hoist to the waistband of his breeches, he said,--“Ay, I have it--you were to believe me, because your name was written with an O, for Grahame.
I have never been in this way before, and would not now,” she said, sitting upright, and wiping her eyes with her apron,--“would not now--but that--but that he loved _me_.
if he loved nothing else that was human--To die so, and by such hands!” And again the unhappy woman gave way to a paroxysm of sorrow, mingling her tears with sobbing, wailing, and all the abandonment of female grief, when at its utmost height.
At length, she gradually recovered the austerity of her natural composure, and maintained it as if by a forcible exertion of resolution, repelling, as she spoke, the repeated returns of the hysterical affection, by such an effort as that by which epileptic patients are known to suspend the recurrence of their fits.
Yet her mind, however resolved, could not so absolutely overcome the affection of her nerves, but that she was agitated by strong fits of trembling, which, for a minute or two at a time, shook her whole frame in a manner frightful to witness.
You shall see that I am so.” She took from the table a piece of unfinished sewing-work, and, with steadiness and composure, passed a silken thread into the eye of a fine needle.--“Could I have done that,” she said, with a smile yet more ghastly than her previous look of fixed despair, “had not my heart and hand been both steady?” She then led the way rapidly up stairs to Nigel&#39;s chamber, and proceeded through the secret passage with the same haste, as if she had feared her resolution might have failed her ere her purpose was executed.
His daughter sank beside the bed, clasped her hands, and prayed to heaven, in a short and affectionate manner, for support in her affliction, and for vengeance on the villains who had made her fatherless.
She put her hand on the heart, but there was no throb--held a feather to the lips, but there was no motion--then kissed with deep reverence the starting veins of the pale forehead, and then the emaciated hand.
“Ay, by G----, but I will except, though,” said the fellow with the green plush jacket: “I will overload my wherry neither for love nor money--I love my boat as well as my wife, and a thought better.” “Nay, nay, comrade,” said his mate, “that is speaking no true water language.
As this communication related to the plan which Hildebrod had been pleased to form, of promoting a marriage betwixt Nigel himself and the rich heiress of Trapbois, the fear of losing an opportunity not to be regained, together with the mean malignity of a low-bred ruffian, disappointed in a favourite scheme, was most likely to instigate the bravo to the deed of violence which had been committed.
But deil d--n me, sir, and I am not wont to swear, but if you touch my Scotch shouther with that shule of yours, I will make six inches of my Andrew Ferrara deevilish intimate with your guts, neighbour.” And therewithal, though still retreating from the brandished shovel, he made one-third of the basket-hilled broadsword which he wore, visible from the sheath.
I wish it had been at the bottom of the Thames when it first gave the use of its roof to smooth-faced, oily-tongued, double-minded Scots thieves!” “It&#39;s an ill bird that fouls its own nest,” replied his adversary, not perhaps the less bold that he saw matters were taking the turn of a pacific debate; “and a pity it is that a kindly Scot should ever have married in foreign parts, and given life to a purse-proud, pudding-headed, fat-gutted, lean-brained Southron, e&#39;en such as you, Maister Christie.
Weel, mistress, if I have guessed the man aright, he is one with whom I am, and have been, intimate and familiar,--nay,--I may truly say I have done him much service in my time, and may live to do him more.
CHAPTER XXVII This way lie safety and a sure retreat; Yonder lie danger, shame, and punishment Most welcome danger then--Nay, let me say, Though spoke with swelling heart--welcome e&#39;en shame And welcome punishment--for, call me guilty, I do but pay the tax that&#39;s due to justice; And call me guiltless, then that punishment Is shame to those alone who do inflict it, _The Tribunal_.
Only, if you owe me any love for the cast I have given you, I pray you not to dive so deep into the pockets of the next apprentice that you find fool enough to play the cavalier.--And you, you greedy swine,” said he to his companion, who still had a longing eye fixed on the money which Nigel continued to offer, “push off, or, if I take a stretcher in hand, I&#39;ll break the knave&#39;s pate of thee.” The fellow pushed off, as he was commanded, but still could not help muttering, “This was entirely out of waterman&#39;s rules.” Glenvarloch, though without the devotion of the “injured Thales” of the moralist, to the memory of that great princess, had now attained “The hallow&#39;d soil which gave Eliza birth,” whose halls were now less respectably occupied by her successor.
His Majesty loves Greenwich--hunts every morning in the Park--all decent persons admitted that have the entries of the Palace--no rabble--frightened the king&#39;s horse with their hallooing, the uncombed slaves.--Yes, sir, the beard more peaked?
Ben Jonson, in drawing James&#39;s character, says, he loved “no part of a swine.”] nor my Lord Duke of Lennox, nor Lord Dalgarno,--nay, I am sure, sir, if I touched you this time, it was your fault, not mine.--But a single drop of the styptic, another little patch that would make a doublet for a flea, just under the left moustache; it will become you when you smile, sir, as well as a dimple; and if you would salute your fair mistress--but I beg pardon, you are a grave gentleman, very grave to be so young.--Hope I have given no offence; it is my duty to entertain customers--my duty, sir, and my pleasure--Sir Munko Malcrowther?--yes, sir, I dare say he is at this moment in Ned&#39;s eating-house, for few folks ask him out, now Lord Huntinglen is gone to London.
I am one of the clerks of the kitchen now, make me thankful--with a finger in the purveyor&#39;s office, and may get my whole hand in by and by.” “I am truly glad,” said Nigel, “to hear that you have not suffered on my account,--still more so at your good fortune.” “You bear a kind heart, my lord,” said Linklater, “and do not forget poor people; and, troth, I see not why they should be forgotten, since the king&#39;s errand may sometimes fall in the cadger&#39;s gate.
I have followed your lordship in the street, just to look at such a stately shoot of the old oak-tree; and my heart jumped into my throat, when I saw you sitting openly in the eating-house yonder, and knew there was such danger to your person.” “What!
The king has both a head to apprehend what is just, and a heart to do what is kind.” “It is e&#39;en true, my lord, and so we, his old servants, know,” added Linklater; “but, woe&#39;s me, if you knew how many folks make it their daily and nightly purpose to set his head against his heart, and his heart against his head--to make him do hard things because they are called just, and unjust things because they are represented as kind.
I cannot think he would attempt a crime so desperate and useless.” “I profess neither love nor favour to the young man,” answered Buckingham, whose high-spirited ambition bore always an open character: “but I cannot but agree with your Highness, that our dear gossip hath been something hasty in apprehending personal danger from him.” “By my saul, Steenie, ye are not blate, to say so!” said the king.
The dark and low arch, which seemed, like the entrance to Dante&#39;s Hell, to forbid hope of regress--the muttered sounds of the warders, and petty formalities observed in opening and shutting the grated wicket--the cold and constrained salutation of the Lieutenant of the fortress, who showed his prisoner that distant and measured respect which authority pays as a tax to decorum, all struck upon Nigel&#39;s heart, impressing on him the cruel consciousness of captivity.
Besides, I have already told too much to one whose heart I thought I had moved--yet I find myself here.” “To whom did you make this disclosure?” said Nigel.
She is but the wife of a clod-pated old chandler, who was idiot enough to marry a wench twenty years younger than himself.
His simulation had, in a word, placed him in the unlucky predicament of being rallied as a braggart amongst the dissipated youths, with whom the reality of the amour would have given him credit; whilst, on the other hand, he was branded as an inhospitable seducer by the injured husband, who was obstinately persuaded of his guilt.
CHAPTER XXIX How fares the man on whom good men would look With eyes where scorn and censure combated, But that kind Christian love hath taught the lesson-- That they who merit most contempt and hate, Do most deserve our pity.-- _Old Play_.
“I am not your accuser, my lord; but I trust in heaven, that your own heart has already accused you bitterly on the inhospitable wrong which your late landlord has sustained at your hand.” “Had I been guilty of what you allude to,” said Lord Glenvarloch,--“had a moment of temptation hurried me away, I had long ere now most bitterly repented it.
I speak in bitterness of heart, from what I remember of your worthy father; and if his son hears of his degeneracy from no one else, he shall hear it from the old goldsmith.” This new suspicion drove Nigel to the very extremity of his patience; yet the motives and zeal of the good old man, as well as the circumstances of suspicion which created his displeasure, were so excellent an excuse for it, that they formed an absolute curb on the resentment of Lord Glenvarloch, and constrained him, after two or three hasty exclamations, to observe a proud and sullen silence.
I have marked every look, every gesture; and whilst I can draw breath, I shall ever think of her with--” “Think not at all of her, my lord,” answered George Heriot, interrupting him; “it is, I have a notion, the best favour you can do her;--or think of her as the daughter of Davy Ramsay, the clockmaker, no proper subject for fine speeches, romantic adventures, or high-flown Arcadian compliments.
_Ballad of Jemmy Dawson._ Master George Heriot and his ward, as she might justly be termed, for his affection to Margaret imposed on him all the cares of a guardian, were ushered by the yeoman of the guard to the lodging of the Lieutenant, where they found him seated with his lady.
you have been to Greenwich?” “You might as well ask me, madam,” answered the Knight, “whether there is any news from hell.” “How, Sir Mungo, how!” said Sir Edward, “measure your words something better--You speak of the Court of King James.” “Sir Edward, if I spoke of the court of the twelve Kaisers, I would say it is as confused for the present as the infernal regions.
But do not you, Sir Mungo, set your wit against a fool&#39;s, though he be a court fool.” “A fool, said you?” replied Sir Mungo, not having fully heard what Master Heriot said, or not choosing to have it thought so,--“I have been a fool indeed, to hang on at a close-fisted Court here, when men of understanding and men of action have been making fortunes in every other place of Europe.
This fallow whom I spoke of--This Tubbs, or Stubbs, or whatever the plebeian was called, came forward as bold as an emperor, and said to the people, &#39;Good friends, I come to leave here the hand of a true Englishman,&#39; and clapped it on the dressing-block with as much ease as if he had laid it on his sweetheart&#39;s shoulder; whereupon Derrick the hangman, adjusting, d&#39;ye mind me, the edge of his cleaver on the very joint, hit it with the mallet with such force, that the hand flew off as far from the owner as a gauntlet which the challenger casts down in the tilt-yard.
The people gave him three cheers, which he deserved for his stout heart; and, truly, I hope to see your lordship suffer with the same magnanimity.” “I thank you, Sir Mungo,” said Nigel, who had not been able to forbear some natural feelings of an unpleasant nature during this lively detail,--“I have no doubt the exhibition will be a very engaging one to you and the other spectators, whatever it may prove to the party principally concerned.” “Vera engaging,” answered Sir Mungo, “vera interesting--vera interesting indeed, though not altogether so much so as an execution for high treason.
Had I had my own will, I would have had her to Bridewell, to flog the wild blood out of her--a cutty quean, to think of wearing the breeches, and not so much as married yet!” “Hark ye, Sir Mungo Malagrowther,” answered Nigel, “I would have you talk of that young person with fitting respect.” “With all the respect that befits your lordship&#39;s paramour, and Davy Ramsay&#39;s daughter, I shall certainly speak of her, my lord,” said Sir Mungo, assuming a dry tone of irony.
So I got charge to take the young fence-louper to the Tower here, and deliver her to the charge of Lady Mansel; and his Majesty charged me to say not a word to her about your offences, for, said he, the poor thing is breaking her heart for him.” “And on this you have charitably founded the opinion to the prejudice of this young lady, which you have now thought proper to express?” said Lord Glenvarloch.
But truly I must needs think this young leddy--if you call Watchie Ramsay&#39;s daughter a young leddy--demeans herself more like a leddy of pleasure than a leddy of honour.” “You do her egregious wrong, Sir Mungo,” said Nigel; “or rather you have been misled by appearances.” “So will all the world be misled, my lord,” replied the satirist, “unless you were doing that to disabuse them which your father&#39;s son will hardly judge it fit to do.” “And what may that be, I pray you?” “E&#39;en marry the lass--make her Leddy Glenvarloch.--Ay, ay, ye may start--but it&#39;s the course you are driving on.
Rather marry than do worse, if the worst be not done already.” “Sir Mungo,” said Nigel, “I pray you to forbear this subject, and rather return to that of the mutilation, upon which it pleased you to enlarge a short while since.” “I have not time at present,” said Sir Mungo, hearing the clock strike four; “but so soon as you shall have received sentence, my lord, you may rely on my giving you the fullest detail of the whole solemnity; and I give you my word, as a knight and a gentleman, that I will myself attend you on the scaffold, whoever may cast sour looks on me for doing so.
I bear a heart, to stand by a friend in the worst of times.” So saying, he wished Lord Glenvarloch farewell; who felt as heartily rejoiced at his departure, though it may be a bold word, as any person who had ever undergone his society.
But the contending feelings suggested a new train of ideas.--“Ancestry,” he thought, “and ancient descent, what are they to me?--My patrimony alienated--my title become a reproach--for what can be so absurd as titled beggary?--my character subjected to suspicion,--I will not remain in this country; and should I, at leaving it, procure the society of one so lovely, so brave, and so faithful, who should say that I derogated from the rank which I am virtually renouncing?” There was something romantic and pleasing, as he pursued this picture of an attached and faithful pair, becoming all the world to each other, and stemming the tide of fate arm in arm; and to be linked thus with a creature so beautiful, and who had taken such devoted and disinterested concern in his fortunes, formed itself into such a vision as romantic youth loves best to dwell upon.
Lord of his castle and his towers, his forests and fields, his fair patrimony and noble name, his mind would have rejected, as a sort of impossibility, the idea of elevating to his rank the daughter of a mechanic; but, when degraded from his nobility, and plunged into poverty and difficulties, he was ashamed to feel himself not unwilling, that this poor girl, in the blindness of her affection, should abandon all the better prospects of her own settled condition, to embrace the precarious and doubtful course which he himself was condemned to.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“Gie me them--gie me them--before ye speak a word, I charge you, on your allegiance.” Richie took a box from his bosom, and, stooping on one knee, presented it to his Majesty, who hastily opened it, and having ascertained that it contained a certain carcanet of rubies, with which the reader was formerly made acquainted, he could not resist falling into a sort of rapture, kissing the gems, as if they had been capable of feeling, and repeating again and again with childish delight, “_Onyx cum prole, silexque_---_Onyx cum prole!_ Ah, my bright and bonny sparklers, my heart loups light to see you again.” He then turned to Richie, upon whose stoical countenance his Majesty&#39;s demeanour had excited something like a grim smile, which James interrupted his rejoicing to reprehend, saying, “Take heed, sir, you are not to laugh at us--we are your anointed Sovereign.” “God forbid that I should laugh!” said Richie, composing his countenance into its natural rigidity.
us that are the very _malleus maleficarum_, the contunding and contriturating hammer of all witches, sorcerers, magicians, and the like; he thinks we are taking a touch of the black art outsells!--But gang thy way, honest Geordie; thou art a good plain man, but nane of the seven sages of Greece; gang thy way, and mind the soothfast word which you spoke, small time syne, that there is one in this land that comes near to Solomon, King of Israel, in all his gifts, except in his love to strange women, forby the daughter of Pharaoh.” If Heriot was surprised at seeing the jewels so unexpectedly produced at the moment the king was upbraiding him for the loss of them, this allusion to the reflection which had escaped him while conversing with Lord Glenvarloch, altogether completed his astonishment; and the king was so delighted with the superiority which it gave him at the moment, that he rubbed his hands, chuckled, and finally, his sense of dignity giving way to the full feeling of triumph, he threw himself into his easy-chair, and laughed with unconstrained violence till he lost his breath, and the tears ran plentifully down his cheeks as he strove to recover it.
The old Scottish Lord having made his reverence in the usual manner, the king extended his hand to be kissed, and then began to address him in a tone of great sympathy.
He also recovered himself again, and said in the pettish way which usually indicated his displeasure--“Yes, my lord, it was we that said it--_non surdo canis_--we are not deaf--we pray you not to raise your voice in speech with us--there is the bonny memorial--read, and judge for yourself.” The king then thrust into the old nobleman&#39;s hand a paper, containing the story of the Lady Hermione, with the evidence by which it was supported, detailed so briefly and clearly, that the infamy of Lord Dalgarno, the lover by whom she had been so shamefully deceived, seemed undeniable.
For a long time the Lady Hermione could not brook the idea of making her situation public; and when her mind became changed in that particular, it was necessary to recover the evidence of the false marriage, and letters and papers connected with it, which, when she came to Paris, and just before I saw her, she had deposited with a correspondent of her father in that city.
The king was in the utmost alarm, called upon Heriot and Maxwell for help, and, presence of mind not being his _forte_, ran to and fro in his cabinet, exclaiming--“My ancient and beloved servant--who saved our anointed self!
_vae atque dolor!_ My Lord of Huntinglen, look up--look up, man, and your son may marry the Queen of Sheba if he will.” By this time Maxwell and Heriot had raised the old nobleman, and placed him on a chair; while the king, observing that he began to recover himself, continued his consolations more methodically.
The large tear gushed reluctantly from his eye, as he kissed the withered hands, which the king, weeping with less dignity and restraint, abandoned to him, first alternately and then both together, until the feelings of the man getting entirely the better of the Sovereign&#39;s sense of dignity, he grasped and shook Lord Huntinglen&#39;s hands with the sympathy of an equal and a familiar friend.
“_Compone lachrymas_,” said the Monarch; “be patient, man, be patient; the council, and Baby Charles, and Steenie, may a&#39; gang to the deevil--he shall not marry her since it moves you so deeply.” “He _shall_ marry her, by God!” answered the earl, drawing himself up, dashing the tear from his eyes, and endeavouring to recover his composure.
“I pray your Majesty&#39;s pardon, but he shall marry her, with her dishonour for her dowry, were she the veriest courtezan in all Spain--If he gave his word, he shall make his word good, were it to the meanest creature that haunts the streets--he shall do it, or my own dagger shall take the life that I gave him.
I tell ye, man, (but I would not for a boddle that Baby Charles heard me,) that he might gie the glaiks to half the lasses of Lonnun, ere I could find in my heart speak such harsh words as you have said of this deil of a Dalgarno of yours.” “May it please your Majesty to permit me to retire,” said Lord Huntinglen, “and dispose of the case according to your own royal sense of justice, for I desire no favour for him.” “Aweel, my lord, so be it; and if your lordship can think,” added the Monarch, “of any thing in our power which might comfort you--” “Your Majesty&#39;s gracious sympathy,” said Lord Huntinglen, “has already comforted me as far as earth can; the rest must be from the King of kings.” “To Him I commend you, my auld and faithful servant,” said James with emotion, as the earl withdrew from his presence.
“Or bairns can read, they first maun spell, I learn&#39;d this frae my mammy, And cast a leglin-girth mysell, Lang ere I married Tammy.” _Christ&#39;s Kirk On The Green_.]
“We hope,” said his Majesty, “that Lord Dalgarno stands prepared to do justice to this unfortunate lady, and to his own character and honour?” “May I humbly inquire the penalty,” said Lord Dalgarno, “in case I should unhappily find compliance with your Majesty&#39;s demands impossible?” “Banishment frae our Court, my lord,” said the king; “frae our Court and our countenance.” “Unhappy exile that I may be!” said Lord Dalgarno, in a tone of subdued irony--“I will at least carry your Majesty&#39;s picture with me, for I shall never see such another king.” “And banishment, my lord,” said the Prince, sternly, “from these our dominions.” “That must be by form of law, please your Royal Highness,” said Dalgarno, with an affectation of deep respect; “and I have not heard that there is a statute, compelling us, under such penalty, to marry every woman we may play the fool with.
I have looked over this schedule of the goods and effects of Erminia Pauletti, daughter of the late noble--yes, he is called the noble, or I read wrong, Giovanni Pauletti, of the Houee of Sansovino, in Genoa, and of the no less noble Lady Maud Olifaunt, of the House of Glenvarloch--Well, I declare that I was pre-contracted in Spain to this noble lady, and there has passed betwixt us some certain _proelibatio matrimonii_; and now, what more does this grave assembly require of me?” “That you should repair the gross and infamous wrong you have done the lady, by marrying her within this hour,” said the Prince.
So buckle them, my Lord Bishop, as fast as you can, that they may sunder again the sooner.” The Bishop accordingly opened his book and commenced the marriage ceremony, under circumstances so novel and so inauspicious.
For, though she at first professed that she assumed this disguise in order to countenance the woman who should present us with the Lady Hermione&#39;s petition, for whom she professed entire affection; yet when we, suspecting _anguis in herba_, did put her to the very question, she was compelled to own a virtuous attachment for Glenvarlochides, in such a pretty passion of shame and fear, that we had much ado to keep our own eyes from keeping company with hers in weeping.
hast thou not a word of oily compliment to me on my happy marriage?--not a word of most philosophical consolation on my disgrace at Court?--Or has my mien, as a wittol and discarded favourite, the properties of the Gorgon&#39;s head, the _turbatae Palladis arma_, as Majesty might say?” “My lord, I am glad--my lord, I am sorry,”--answered the trembling scrivener, who, aware of the vivacity of Lord Dalgarno&#39;s temper, dreaded the consequence of the communication he had to make to him.
Let me see--Black Feltham, and Dick Shakebag--we shall want a fourth--I love to make sure, and the booty will stand parting, besides what I can bucket them out of.
You Scots are ever fair and false, and an honest man cannot thrive within eyeshot of you.” “As to our poverty, friend,” replied Richie, “that is as Heaven pleases; but touching our falset, I&#39;ll prove to you that a Scotsman bears as leal and true a heart to his friend as ever beat in English doublet.” “I care not whether he does or not,” said the gallant.
Richard Moniplies, like most folk who have a good opinion of themselves, was fond of the task of consolation, which at once displayed his superiority, (for the consoler is necessarily, for the time at least, superior to the afflicted person,) and indulged his love of talking.
“Well, that same pretty girl--and I will uphold her the prettiest betwixt Paul&#39;s and the Bar--she is to be wedded to your Lord Glenvarloch, with a pestilence on him!” “That is impossible,” said Richie; “it is raving nonsense, man--they make April gouks of you cockneys every month in the year--The Lord Glenvarloch marry the daughter of a Lonnon mechanic!
I would as soon believe the great Prester John would marry the daughter of a Jew packman.” “Hark ye, brother,” said Jin Vin, “I will allow no one to speak disregardfully of the city, for all I am in trouble.” “I crave your pardon, man--I meant no offence,” said Richie; “but as to the marriage, it is a thing simply impossible.” “It is a thing that will take place, though, for the Duke and the Prince, and all of them, have a finger in it; and especially the old fool of a king, that makes her out to be some great woman in her own country, as all the Scots pretend to be, you know.” “Master Vincent, but that you are under affliction,” said the consoler, offended on his part, “I would hear no national reflections.” The afflicted youth apologised in his turns, but asserted, “it was true that the king said Peg-a-Ramsay was some far-off sort of noblewoman; and that he had taken a great interest in the match, and had run about like an old gander, cackling about Peggie ever since he had seen her in hose and doublet--and no wonder,” added poor Vin, with a deep sigh.
“Hout tout, man,” said Richie, “mind where the Stewarts come frae, and never think they would want spears or claymores either; but leaving sic matters, whilk are perilous to speak on, I say once more, what is your concern in all this matter?” “What is it?” said Jenkin; “why, have I not fixed on Peg-a-Ramsay to be my true love, from the day I came to her old father&#39;s shop?
and instead of going peaceably down to the ship at Gravesend, did not he rant and bully, and show his pistols, and make me land him at Greenwich, where he played some swaggering pranks, that helped both him and me into the Tower?” “Aha!” said Richie, throwing more than his usual wisdom into his looks, “so you were the green-jacketed waterman that rowed Lord Glenvarloch down the river?” “The more fool I, that did not souse him in the Thames,” said Jenkin; “and I was the lad who would not confess one word of who and what I was, though they threatened to make me hug the Duke of Exeter&#39;s daughter.” [Footnote: A particular species of rack, used at the Tower of London, was so called.]
and she spoke so sweetly and so coldly at the same time, I wished myself in the deepest dungeon of the Tower--I wish they had racked me to death before I heard this Scottishman was to chouse me out of my sweetheart!” “But are ye sure ye have lost her?” said Richie; “it sounds strange in my ears that my Lord Glenvarloch should marry the daughter of a dealer,--though there are uncouth marriages made in London, I&#39;ll allow that.” “Why, I tell you this lord was no sooner clear of the Tower, than he and Master George Heriot comes to make proposals for her, with the king&#39;s assent, and what not; and fine fair-day prospects of Court favour for this lord, for he hath not an acre of land.” “Well, and what said the auld watch-maker?” said Richie; “was he not, as might weel beseem him, ready to loop out of his skin-case for very joy?” “He multiplied six figures progressively, and reported the product--then gave his consent.” “And what did you do?” “I rushed into the streets,” said the poor lad, “with a burning heart and a blood-shot eye--and where did I first find myself, but with that beldam, Mother Suddlechop--and what did she propose to me, but to take the road?” “Take the road, man?
“But be he who he will, they may rob the whole world an they list, for I am robbed and ruined.” Richie filled his friend&#39;s cup up to the brim, and insisted that he should drink what he called “clean caup out.” “This love,” he said, “is but a bairnly matter for a brisk young fellow like yourself, Master Jenkin.
Know you where they are to be found?” “Ay, marry do I,” replied Richie.
We must not be seen abroad together.--I know not how it is, Master Moniplies,” continued he, as his countenance brightened up, and while, in his turn, he filled the cups, “but I feel my heart something lighter since I have thought of this matter.” “Thus it is to have counsellors, Master Jenkin,” said Richie; “and truly I hope to hear you say that your heart is as light as a lavrock&#39;s, and that before you are many days aulder.
“I dare say,” she said, baring her wrist and a part of her arm, “it is all black and blue to the very elbow.” “I dare say you are a silly little fool,” said the cavalier, carelessly kissing the aggrieved arm; “it is only a pretty incarnate which sets off the blue veins.” “Nay, my lord, now it is you are silly,” answered the dame; “but I am glad I can make you speak and laugh on any terms this morning.
A lady-wife,” continued Dalgarno, “is a very different thing from a lady-love.” “I heard from Mrs. Suddlechop, whom you lodged me with since I left poor old John Christie, that Lord Glenvarloch is to marry David Ramsay the clockmaker&#39;s daughter?” “There is much betwixt the cup and the lip, Nelly.
“Well, but my father was as good a man as old Davy Ramsay, and as well to pass in the world, my lord; and, therefore, why should you not marry me?
Well, Nelly, we will look into that matter; and whether we get married again or no, we will at least do our best to get unmarried.” “Shall we indeed, my honey-sweet lord?
and then I will think less about John Christie, for he will marry again, I warrant you, for he is well to pass; and I would be glad to think he had somebody to take care of him, as I used to do, poor loving old man!
John Christie (the kind heart!)
Thus his criminal amour became the indirect cause of his losing his life; and thus “our pleasant vices are made the whips to scourge us.” The riders arrived on the field at full gallop the moment after the shot was fired; and Richie, who had his own reasons for attaching himself to Colepepper, who was bustling to untie the portmanteau from the page&#39;s saddle, pushed against him with such violence as to overthrow him, his own horse at the same time stumbling and dismounting his rider, who was none of the first equestrians.
Thou must needs leave duty, and decency, and domestic love, to revel it gaily with the wild and with the wicked; and there thou liest like a crushed worm, writhing beside the lifeless body of thy paramour.
Thou hast done me much wrong--dishonoured me among friends--driven credit from my house, and peace from my fireside--But thou wert my first and only love, and I will not see thee an utter castaway, if it lies with me to prevent it.--Gentlemen, I render ye such thanks as a broken-hearted man can give.--Richard, commend me to your honourable master.
We are unable to trace his fate farther, but believe it was prosperous, and that he entered into an advantageous partnership with his fellow-apprentice, upon old Davy Ramsay retiring from business, in consequence of his daughter&#39;s marriage.
Not a circumstance was then omitted, from the manly ardour of the bridegroom, and the modest blushes of the bride, to the parson&#39;s new surplice, and the silk tabinet mantua of the bridesmaid.
That learned and good-humoured monarch made no great figure in the politics of Europe; but then, to make amends, he was prodigiously busy, when he could find a fair opportunity of intermeddling with the private affairs of his loving subjects, and the approaching marriage of Lord Glenvarloch was matter of great interest to him.
He laboured for several weeks, while the courtship was in progress, with his own royal eyes, so as wellnigh to wear out, he declared, a pair of her father&#39;s best barnacles, in searching through old books and documents, for the purpose of establishing the bride&#39;s pretensions to a noble, though remote descent, and thereby remove the only objection which envy might conceive against the match.
We mention these things at the mair length, because we would have you all to know, that it is not without due consideration of the circumstances of all parties, that we design, in a small and private way, to honour with our own royal presence the marriage of Lord Glenvarloch with Margaret Ramsay, daughter and heiress of David Ramsay, our horologer, and a cadet only thrice removed from the ancient house of Dalwolsey.
_Sic fuit, est, et erit_.-Jingling Geordie, as ye stand to the cost of the marriage feast, we look for good cheer.” Heriot bowed, as in duty bound.
What do you propose to give, Master George?--we begin with the city when money is in question.” [Footnote: The penny-wedding of the Scots, now disused even among the lowest ranks, was a peculiar species of merry-making, at which, if the wedded pair were popular, the guests who convened, contributed considerable sums under pretence of paying for the bridal festivity, but in reality to set the married folk afloat in the world.]
“Only a trifle, Sir Mungo--I give my god-daughter the marriage ring; it is a curious jewel--I bought it in Italy; it belonged to Cosmo de Medici.
Little good comes of marrying the daughter of the house you are at feud with; indeed, it was less poor Dalgarno&#39;s fault, than theirs that forced the match on him; but I am glad the young folk are to have something to live on, come how it like, whether by charity or inheritance.
On the morning of the bridal-day, Richie was particularly attentive in doing all a valet-de-chambre could, so as to set off to advantage the very handsome figure of his master; and when he had arranged his dress to the utmost exactness, and put to his long curled locks what he called “the finishing touch of the redding-kaim,” he gravely kneeled down, kissed his hand, and bade him farewell, saying that he humbly craved leave to discharge himself of his lordship&#39;s service.
The reader must fancy the scattered flowers which strewed the path of the happy couple to church--the loud music which accompanied the procession--the marriage service performed by a bishop--the king, who met them at Saint Paul&#39;s, giving away the bride,--to the great relief of her father, who had thus time, during the ceremony, to calculate the just quotient to be laid on the pinion of report in a timepiece which he was then putting together.
he swallowed a hearty cup of wine to the happiness of the married couple, and began to amble about the room, mumping, laughing, and cracking jests, neither the wittiest nor the most delicate, but accompanied and applauded by shouts of his own mirth, in order to encourage that of the company.
“It is a subject he states himself as quite indifferent about, so long as it can pleasure your Majesty.” “Body of us, man!” said the king, “it is the speech of a true man and a loving subject, and we will grace him accordingly--what though he be but a carle--a twopenny cat may look at a king.
He is truly honest, and has a heart and hand that make amends for some folly.
Kneel down, Richie--somebody lend me a rapier--yours, Mr. Langstaff, (that&#39;s a brave name for a lawyer,)--ye need not flash it out that gate, Templar fashion, as if ye were about to pink a bailiff!” He took the drawn sword, and with averted eyes, for it was a sight he loved not to look on, endeavoured to lay it on Richie&#39;s shoulder, but nearly stuck it into his eye.
He married, for his first wife, a maiden of his own rank, named Christian Marjoribanks, daughter of a respectable burgess.
George Heriot, having lost his wife, connected himself with the distinguished house of Rosebery, by marrying a daughter of James Primrose, Clerk to the Privy Council.
There was produced in court a parcel of dolls or puppets belonging to this lady, some naked, some dressed, and which she used for exhibiting fashions upon.
To kiss the chambermaid, and for a leap O&#39; the vaulting horse, to ply the vaulting house; For exercise of arms a bale of dice, And two or three packs of cards to show the cheat And nimbleness of hand; mistake a cloak From my lord&#39;s back, and pawn it; ease his pockets Of a superfluous watch, or geld a jewel Of an odd stone or so; twinge three or four buttons From off my lady&#39;s gown: These are the arts, Or seven liberal deadly sciences, Of pagery, or rather paganism, As the tides run; to which, if he apply him, He may, perhaps, take a degree at Tyburn, A year the earlier come to read a lecture Upon Aquinas, at Saint Thomas-a-Watering&#39;s And so go forth a laureate in hemp-circle.” The New Inn, Act I.
“&#39;Of London city I am free, And there I first my wife did see, And for that very cause,&#39; said he, &#39;I love it.
In Letitia Aikin&#39;s Memoirs of the Reign of King James, will be found a letter from Sir Thomas Howard to Lord L. Harrington, in which he recommends the latter to come to court, mentioning that his Majesty has spoken favourably of him.
The multitude standing about was deeply silent, either out of horror of this new and unwonted kind of punishment, or out of commiseration towards the man, as being of an honest and unblamable repute, or else out of hatred to the marriage, which most men presaged would be the overthrow of religion.”--CAMDBN&#39;S _Annals for the Year_ 1581.
But to make this more plain and certain, we shall add a story of a notable impostor, or ventriloquist, from the testimony of Mr. Ady, which we have had confirmed from the mouth of some courtiers, that both saw and knew him, and is this:--It hath been (saith he) credibly reported, that there was a man in the court of King James his days, that could act this imposture so lively, that he could call the King by name, and cause the King to look round about him, wondering who it was that called him, whereas he that called him stood before him in his presence, with his face towards him.
But after this imposture was known, the King, in his merriment, would sometimes take occasionally this impostor to make sport upon some of his courtiers, as, for instance:-- “There was a knight belonging to the court, whom the King caused to come before him in his private room, (where no man was but the King, and this knight and the impostor,) and feigned some occasion of serious discourse with the knight; but when the King began to speak and the knight bending his attention to the King, suddenly there came a voice as out of another room, calling the knight by name, &#39;Sir John, Sir John; come away, Sir John;&#39; at which the knight began to frown that any man should be unmannerly as to molest the King and him; and still listening to the King&#39;s discourse, the voice came again, &#39;Sir John, Sir John; come away and drink off your sack.&#39;
Whether out of a meddling propensity common to all who have a gossiping disposition, or from the love of justice, which ought to make part of a prince&#39;s character, James was very fond of enquiring personally into the causes _celebres_ which occurred during his reign.
BUSS, kiss.
COSHERING, being familiar and intimate.
DRAB, illicit sexual intercourse.

Though time be fleet, and I and thou Are half a life asunder, Thy loving smile will surely hail The love-gift of a fairy-tale.
“Oh, you wicked little thing!” cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace.
Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside.
I wonder if the snow _loves_ the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently?
The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little Lily in silence.
“There ought to be some men moving about somewhere—and so there are!” She added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on.
“I can’t remember here.” So they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into another open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air, and shook itself free from Alice’s arms.
“The first thing in a visit is to say ‘How d’ye do?’ and shake hands!” And here the two brothers gave each other a hug, and then they held out the two hands that were free, to shake hands with her.
“‘_The Walrus and the Carpenter_’ is the longest,” Tweedledum replied, giving his brother an affectionate hug.
My heart went hop, my heart went thump; I filled the kettle at the pump.
His name is Haigha.” (He pronounced it so as to rhyme with “mayor.”) “I love my love with an H,” Alice couldn’t help beginning, “because he is Happy.
“This young lady loves you with an H,” the King said, introducing Alice in the hope of turning off the Messenger’s attention from himself—but it was no use—the Anglo-Saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side.
It saves time, remember!” And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, “just in honour of having been a Red Queen.” “Snowdrop, my pet!” she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, “when _will_ Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder?

emma

She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister’s marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period.
Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.
Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married.
It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance.
She recalled her past kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood.
A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella’s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.
She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of hers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault.
She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.
The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.
Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter’s marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.
Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella’s husband.
Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—in a joke—it is all a joke.
“We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor’s advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor’s time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.
I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.” Mr. Knightley shook his head at her.
And after such success, you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again.
Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again.
Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage.
But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, ‘I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success?
Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.
Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her fortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate—was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off with due decorum.
Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best.
They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.
Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills, as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years’ marriage, he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.
He had, by that time, realised an easy competence—enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for—enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.
He had never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.
Now, upon his father’s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place.
Mrs. Weston had, of course, formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured.
With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.
Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.
She loved every body, was interested in every body’s happiness, quicksighted to every body’s merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing.
He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.
Her father never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston’s marriage her exercise had been too much confined.
Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.
But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place.
Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, he would make a good husband.
Not that she _wanted_ him to marry.
They seem very comfortable as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably repent it.
Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!” “Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not born to an independence.
They have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year.” “I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does marry;—I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife—for though his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice.
I want to see you permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer’s daughter, without education.” “To be sure.
Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education—and been very well brought up.
But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it.” Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no alarming symptoms of love.
I hope, with all my heart, the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.—But Harriet Smith—I have not half done about Harriet Smith.
I love to look at her; and I will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain.
John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children.
I am sure of having their opinions with me.” “I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind; but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma’s mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith’s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you.
I wonder what will become of her!” “So do I,” said Mrs. Weston gently, “very much.” “She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just nothing at all.
It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object.
I should like to see Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.
She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton’s being in the fairest way of falling in love, if not in love already.
I never met with a disposition more truly amiable.” “I have no doubt of it.” And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation, which had a vast deal of the lover.
She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress, and be charmed.—There was no being displeased with such an encourager, for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible.
She could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable.
“This man is almost too gallant to be in love,” thought Emma.
“I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love.
She had heard, as soon as she got back to Mrs. Goddard’s, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage.
Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter, at least she thought so.
And he wrote as if he really loved her very much—but she did not know—and so, she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.—” Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.
It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with half a heart.
It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin.
That would have been too dreadful!—What an escape!—Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world.” “Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it must have been.
It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more!” “Dear affectionate creature!—_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!—_You_ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!
A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.” “Oh no;—and it is but a short letter too.” Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a “very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that her husband could write a good letter.” “Oh!
She was rather low all the evening, but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton.
I am sure Miss Nash would—for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a linen-draper.” “One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school, Harriet.
I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married.
I can think of but one thing—Who is in love with her?
“I have reason to think,” he replied, “that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:—Robert Martin is the man.
He is desperately in love and means to marry her.” “He is very obliging,” said Emma; “but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him?” “Well, well, means to make her an offer then.
He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage.
I had no hesitation in advising him to marry.
to be sure,” cried Emma, “it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage.
Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you.
But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well.
think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend!
Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own!
They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.—The sphere in which she moves is much above his.—It would be a degradation.” “A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!” “As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense.
Harriet’s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them.
Waiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be nice.
Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you.
Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl.
Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard’s all the rest of her life—or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writing-master’s son.” “We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there can be no use in canvassing it.
But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any second application.
Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;—and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain.” Emma laughed and disclaimed.
I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.” “I am very much obliged to you,” said Emma, laughing again.
“If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton’s marrying Harriet, it would have been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself.
A man must be very much in love, indeed, to describe her so.
I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart.
Mr. Elton, who might marry any body!
I am sure, a month ago, I had no more idea myself!—The strangest things do take place!” “When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted—they do indeed—and really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently, so palpably desirable—what courts the pre-arrangement of other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.
Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls.
There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.
The course of true love never did run smooth— A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage.” “That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,—me, of all people, who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas!
If they are anxious to see you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it;—if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the common phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy them.” “Yes, very true.
How nicely you talk; I love to hear you.
A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or neither.
Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can be no possible reflection on you.” Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love.
He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment.
He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an affectionate father—certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father.
There go you and your riddle-book one of these days.”—Harriet’s was— “Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.” “I do not often walk this way _now_,” said Emma, as they proceeded, “but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this part of Highbury.” Harriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage, and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr. Elton’s seeing ready wit in her.
After a mutual silence of some minutes, Harriet thus began again— “I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or going to be married!
so charming as you are!”— Emma laughed, and replied, “My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry; I must find other people charming—one other person at least.
And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little intention of ever marrying at all.” “Ah!—so you say; but I cannot believe it.” “I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the question: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person.
If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it.” “Dear me!—it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!”— “I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry.
Were I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing!
but I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.
And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine.
Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband’s house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always right in any man’s eyes as I am in my father’s.” “But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!” “That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates!
so silly—so satisfied—so smiling—so prosing—so undistinguishing and unfastidious—and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry to-morrow.
And as for objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much, to care about.
She understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will.
“To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,” thought Emma; “to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of love on each side.
“This would soon have led to something better, of course,” was her consoling reflection; “any thing interests between those who love; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart.
Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella’s sake; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.
Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible.
papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married.
I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have Emma’s account, I hope you will be satisfied.” “Why, to be sure,” said Mr. Woodhouse—“yes, certainly—I cannot deny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often—but then—she is always obliged to go away again.” “It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.—You quite forget poor Mr. Weston.” “I think, indeed,” said John Knightley pleasantly, “that Mr. Weston has some little claim.
As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.” “Me, my love,” cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.— “Are you talking about me?—I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does not deserve.
I shall never forget his flying Henry’s kite for him that very windy day last Easter—and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o’clock at night, on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.—If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.” “Where is the young man?” said John Knightley.
“There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.” “But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,” said her father.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any thing that home affords.” Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass.
While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.
I trust, at least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,” turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband.
“I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking well—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued.
I always regret excessively on dear Emma’s account that she cannot be more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all.
She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her loss without many tears.
“Well,” said she to herself, “this is most strange!—After I had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill behind!—Most strange indeed!—But there is, I believe, in many men, especially single men, such an inclination—such a passion for dining out—a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing gives way to it—and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked.
What a strange thing love is!
Elton in love with me!—What an idea!” “I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly.
Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;—four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home.” Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the “Very true, my love,” which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all.
can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?—Absurd and insufferable!”—Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners.
Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma’s resolution of never marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill, which always interested her.
She had frequently thought—especially since his father’s marriage with Miss Taylor—that if she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition.
And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper.” Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston, very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy—yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.— Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of: “for I cannot depend upon his coming.
It did appear—there was no concealing it—exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!
“You had better order the carriage directly, my love,” said she; “I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk.
To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she found her subject cut up—her hand seized—her attention demanded, and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well known, hoping—fearing—adoring—ready to die if she refused him; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible.
Without scruple—without apology—without much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself _her_ lover.
Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself.
As to myself, I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings—Nothing could be farther from my wishes—your attachment to my friend Harriet—your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent.
She remembered what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself.
He wanted to marry well, and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for.
There had been no real affection either in his language or manners.
Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less allied with real love.
But—that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry him!—should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!—look down upon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below him, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!—It was most provoking.
The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as he could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.—But he had fancied her in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real motive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.
It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him—that Harriet’s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive—and that there could be no necessity for any body’s knowing what had passed except the three principals, and especially for her father’s being given a moment’s uneasiness about it.
The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.—She never could have deserved him—and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible.
Her tears fell abundantly—but her grief was so truly artless, that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma’s eyes—and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding—really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two—and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do.
Her second duty now, inferior only to her father’s claims, was to promote Harriet’s comfort, and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match-making.
Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness—and did, in truth, prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force.
Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs. Goddard’s; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth.
This proves that he can leave the Churchills.” “Yes, sometimes he can.” “And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure.” “It is very unfair to judge of any body’s conduct, without an intimate knowledge of their situation.
Respect would be added to affection.
They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother’s place, but without a mother’s affection to blind her.
My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.” “He is a person I never think of from one month’s end to another,” said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should be angry.
There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts.
She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart, as to her deficiency—but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable,—a waste of time—tiresome women—and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and therefore she seldom went near them.
They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again—for till she married, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother—or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane’s letter—wrote in Mr. Dixon’s name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy.
The marriage of Lieut.
He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about Jane’s age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old, his daughter’s great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education.
Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell’s residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters.
Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too much beloved to be parted with.
The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane’s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements.
They continued together with unabated regard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.
Still, however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment.
She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter’s marriage; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort.
If it were love, it might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone.
The information was, as you state, that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins.
Elton going to be married!” said Emma, as soon as she could speak.
I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.—My dear sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is pork—a roast loin of pork—” “As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted with her,” said Emma, “nothing I suppose can be known.
And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn off.” “Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,” said Miss Bates, “four weeks yesterday.—A Miss Hawkins!—Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts; not that I ever—Mrs.
Elton, and Miss Hawkins!—Good morning to you.” Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry—and to marry strangers too—and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject.
The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes, when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the “Oh!
As Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour.
Ambition, as well as love, had probably been mortified.
CHAPTER IV Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.
He had caught both substance and shadow—both fortune and affection, and was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and his own concerns—expecting to be congratulated—ready to be laughed at—and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more cautiously gallant.
The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly be lessened by his marriage.
Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained—in the law line—nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him, than that he was in the law line; and with him the daughter had lived.
She had talked her into love; but, alas!
Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always in love.
Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins’s happiness, and continual observation of, how much he seemed attached!—his air as he walked by the house—the very sitting of his hat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!
She could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve—something of ingratitude, merely glossed over—it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?
CHAPTER V Small heart had Harriet for visiting.
She went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.
“His father’s marriage,” he said, “had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him.” He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor’s merits, without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse’s character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor’s.
Happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.—Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons’ understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them.
It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her—nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection.
You will be adored in Highbury.
She appeared to me to play well, that is, with considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.—I am excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body’s performance.—I have been used to hear her’s admired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:—a man, a very musical man, and in love with another woman—engaged to her—on the point of marriage—would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down instead—never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.
But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be.” “I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,—that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends.
There is safety in reserve, but no attraction.
One cannot love a reserved person.” “Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction may be the greater.
If it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house.
But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>It did not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday.
Vanity, extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became liable to all these charges.
This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being at least very near it, and saved only by her own indifference—(for still her resolution held of never marrying)—the honour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance.
Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the single men, had already taken place.
Miss Taylor, if you had not married, you would have staid at home with me.” “Well, sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “as I took Miss Taylor away, it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.” But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing, not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse’s agitation.
no, my love; but you will soon be tired.
She loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time—and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort.
She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart, for he stopped to hand her out.
When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of admiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him seated by her—and, as she firmly believed, not without some dexterity on his side.
We were speaking the other day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.” “Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.—I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side.
Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection.
Jane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved—yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain—by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend.
Knightley must not marry!—You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?—Oh!
I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley’s marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely.
I do not want the match—I do not want to injure dear little Henry—but the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry’s account, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?” “Yes, I would.
Knightley marry!—No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt it now.
Excepting inequality of fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.” “But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry.
Why should he marry?—He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of his brother’s children.
He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up his time or his heart.” “My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax—” “Nonsense!
In the way of love, I am sure he does not.
How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?—To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?—‘So very kind and obliging!—But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!’ And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother’s old petticoat.
I think he is just the person to do it, even without being in love.” “Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love.
I see no sign of attachment—I believe nothing of the pianoforte—and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.” They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;—and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it.
Her objections to Mr. Knightley’s marrying did not in the least subside.
Knightley must never marry.
Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him.” “Very likely.—I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar girls in Highbury.” Harriet had business at Ford’s.—Emma thought it most prudent to go with her.
I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart.
True affection only could have prompted it.” Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she had less scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with respect to her.—This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings.
There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side—but no love.
My regard for Hartfield is most warm”— He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.—He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance?
To complete every other recommendation, he had _almost_ told her that he loved her.
What strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous determination against it.
“This sensation of listlessness, weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself, this feeling of every thing’s being dull and insipid about the house!— I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not—for a few weeks at least.
CHAPTER XIII Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love.
Their affection was always to subside into friendship.
When she became sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.
I am quite enough in love.
“_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love—every thing denotes it—very much in love indeed!—and when he comes again, if his affection continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.—It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up.
This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man—I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.—His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable.—Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.—I shall do very well again after a little while—and then, it will be a good thing over; for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I shall have been let off easily.” When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had undervalued their strength.
It was a long, well-written letter, giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision.
“Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton’s marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make _me_.
The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably.
Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!” Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well, nor valued her affection so highly before.
“There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,” said she afterwards to herself.
Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will.
It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved—which gives Isabella all her popularity.—I have it not—but I know how to prize and respect it.—Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives.
The woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as could be.
no—there is nothing to surprize one at all.—A pretty fortune; and she came in his way.” “I dare say,” returned Harriet, sighing again, “I dare say she was very much attached to him.” “Perhaps she might; but it is not every man’s fate to marry the woman who loves him best.
Well, I wish them happy with all my heart.
He is just as superior as ever;—but being married, you know, it is quite a different thing.
Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know—there is a sad story against them, in general.
I used to be quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention.
Though I think he had better not have married.
It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them.” “No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady—and a bride, especially, is never to be neglected.
A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who they may.” “Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what is.
And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton’s notice and the penury of her conversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real, generous affection.” Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there.
I will say that for you.” He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful—and in a manner which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said, “So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?” “No indeed I have not.
no, upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body.
She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than she used to be—And I love an open temper.
I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always—but with no thought beyond.” “Well, Mrs. Weston,” said Emma triumphantly when he left them, “what do you say now to Mr. Knightley’s marrying Jane Fairfax?” “Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last.
Do not beat me.” CHAPTER XVI Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage.

</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Mr. Weston—(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.—A most dangerous precedent indeed!—I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.—Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we married women must begin to exert ourselves!—Oh!
It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen’s saffron robe would be put on for us.
She was nobody when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill’d them all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart.” “Only think!
Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;—but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away, it would be very distressing.
It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been.
Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity.
It was almost enough to make her think of marrying.
She wished he could love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.—He seemed often observing her.
There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.
I am no dancer.” “If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,” said he, “I shall have great pleasure, I am sure—for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert.” “Mrs.
Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing—Miss Smith.” “Miss Smith!—oh!—I had not observed.—You are extremely obliging—and if I were not an old married man.—But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston.
Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her face might be as hot.
‘Oh!’ said I, ‘I shall not forestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.’ My dear sir, you are too obliging.—Is there nobody you would not rather?—I am not helpless.
Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus—so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much concerned!—Well, this is brilliant!
“Emma, why is it that they are your enemies?” He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added, “_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may be.—To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet.” “I did,” replied Emma, “and they cannot forgive me.” He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he only said, “I shall not scold you.
There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not: and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet.
She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.—Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!
Such an adventure as this,—a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain.
It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very indifferent—which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well, and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with.
It was very wrong of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married.
She merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, “Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so”—and thought no more of it, till after a minute’s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, “I shall never marry.” Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a moment’s debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied, “Never marry!—This is a new resolution.” “It is one that I shall never change, however.” After another short hesitation, “I hope it does not proceed from—I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?” “Mr.
Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you.
I would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value.” Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude.
This gallant young man, who seemed to love without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it.
Emma’s confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to declare her affection engaged.
I will invite your guests.” “No,”—he calmly replied,—“there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and that one is—” “—Mrs.
Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the warmest heart.
Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of being sometimes alone!”—seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who loved her best.
Emma returned all her attention to her father, saying in secret— “I am glad I have done being in love with him.
To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he cared for—and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe.
Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively.” They were laying themselves open to that very phrase—and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another.
She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning back her heart.
Though, perhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party—_I_ never was in any circle—exploring parties—young ladies—married women—” Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply, “Very true, my love, very true.
An old married man—quite good for nothing.
Shall we walk, Augusta?” “With all my heart.
I would be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience, an oppression for ever.” He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon afterwards said, in a lively tone, “Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me.
With all my heart.
She felt it at her heart.
_There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct, be open to any severe reproach.
As a daughter, she hoped she was not without a heart.
Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when she might not bear to see herself.
Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps, Mrs. Suckling’s own family, and Mrs. Bragge’s; but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:—lives only four miles from Maple Grove.
Have you any thing to send or say, besides the ‘love,’ which nobody carries?” “Nothing at all.
Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen into her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>This is the simple truth.” Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do.
What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners so _very_ disengaged?
What right had he to endeavour to please, as he certainly did—to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention, as he certainly did—while he really belonged to another?—How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?—How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?—very wrong, very wrong indeed.” “From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine—” “And how could _she_ bear such behaviour!
I must love him; and now that I am satisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may.
“I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might not have heard.” “You are in luck.—Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.” “True.
His wife gave him a look which invited him in; and, while he was coming round, added, “Now, dearest Emma, let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match.
And here, instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.—I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter.” A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate.
Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet’s footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls.
he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while.
“Had you any idea,” cried Harriet, “of his being in love with her?—You, perhaps, might.—You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every body’s heart; but nobody else—” “Upon my word,” said Emma, “I begin to doubt my having any such talent.
Emma turned round to look at her in consternation, and hastily said, “Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley’s returning your affection?” “Yes,” replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully—“I must say that I have.” Emma’s eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating, in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes.
A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart.
Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank Churchill?
It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!
Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same few minutes.
Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits—some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice by Harriet—(there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley—but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent kindness.—For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet’s hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained—or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.—Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.—Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.
How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself, and living under!—The blunders, the blindness of her own head and heart!—she sat still, she walked about, she tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery—in every place, every posture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.
To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first endeavour.
When had his influence, such influence begun?— When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?—She looked back; she compared the two—compared them, as they had always stood in her estimation, from the time of the latter’s becoming known to her—and as they must at any time have been compared by her, had it—oh!
This was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which she reached; and without being long in reaching it.—She was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her—her affection for Mr. Knightley.—Every other part of her mind was disgusting.
Had she left her where she ought, and where he had told her she ought!—Had she not, with a folly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong—all would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.
How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr. Knightley!—How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!—But Harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.—Her inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.—She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton’s being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley’s.—Alas!
CHAPTER XII Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley, first in interest and affection.—Satisfied that it was so, and feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had been.—Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella.
She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him, insensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own—but still, from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no other creature had at all shared.
Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.
How directly, how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!—Not too strongly for the offence—but far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.—She had no hope, nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at times much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be overrating his regard for _her_.—Wish it she must, for his sake—be the consequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life.
Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all, she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.—Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace would be fully secured.—Marriage, in fact, would not do for her.
She would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.
“She loves him then excessively, I suppose.
Her affection must have overpowered her judgment.” “Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.” “I am afraid,” returned Emma, sighing, “that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy.” “On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.
She thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest.
Had she followed Mr. Knightley’s known wishes, in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her better; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now.—Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other—what was she?—Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax’s confidence on this important matter—which was most probable—still, in knowing her as she ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane’s feelings, by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill’s.
such delightful proofs of Hartfield’s attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over.
The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself; and Mrs. Weston’s heart and time would be occupied by it.
They would be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe.
“I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.” Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more composure, “_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have had your suspicions.—I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.—I wish I had attended to it—but—(with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.” For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low, “Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.—Your own excellent sense—your exertions for your father’s sake—I know you will not allow yourself—.” Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a more broken and subdued accent, “The feelings of the warmest friendship—Indignation—Abominable scoundrel!”—And in a louder, steadier tone, he concluded with, “He will soon be gone.
What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has before him!—Assured of the love of such a woman—the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax’s character vouches for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,—equality of situation—I mean, as far as regards society, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but one—and that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.—A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must, I think, be the happiest of mortals.—Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune.
Every thing turns out for his good.—He meets with a young woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her by negligent treatment—and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found her superior.—His aunt is in the way.—His aunt dies.—He has only to speak.—His friends are eager to promote his happiness.—He had used every body ill—and they are all delighted to forgive him.—He is a fortunate man indeed!” “You speak as if you envied him.” “And I do envy him, Emma.
“My dearest Emma,” said he, “for dearest you will always be, whatever the event of this hour’s conversation, my dearest, most beloved Emma—tell me at once.
“I cannot make speeches, Emma:” he soon resumed; and in a tone of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing.—“If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.
At present, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.” While he spoke, Emma’s mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful velocity of thought, had been able—and yet without losing a word—to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet’s hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a delusion as any of her own—that Harriet was nothing; that she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had been all received as discouragement from herself.—And not only was there time for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet’s secret had not escaped her, and to resolve that it need not, and should not.—It was all the service she could now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two—or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he could not marry them both, Emma had it not.
Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.
The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection himself;—but it had been no present hope—he had only, in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.—The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.—The affection, which he had been asking to be allowed to create, if he could, was already his!—Within half an hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to something so like perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.
_Her_ change was equal.—This one half-hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.—On his side, there had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation, of Frank Churchill.—He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other.
He had found her agitated and low.—Frank Churchill was a villain.— He heard her declare that she had never loved him.
Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.—Could he have seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return.
She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father.—She even wept over the idea of it, as a sin of thought.
Acquit me here, and procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly affection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.—Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight, you have now a key to.
My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.
While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman, was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless?—Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.—I was mad enough, however, to resent.—I doubted her affection.
with a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.—I felt that it would be of a different sort.—Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense while all was at stake?—No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her.
A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her.—If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.—Miss W. calls me the child of good fortune.
I hope she is right.—In one respect, my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself, Your obliged and affectionate Son, F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.
As soon as she came to her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment.
She never stopt till she had gone through the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed—and he had suffered, and was very sorry—and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.
You pass it over very handsomely—but you were perfectly right.” “I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:—but yet, I think—had _you_ not been in the case—I should still have distrusted him.” When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud—all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as the subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady reflection, thus— “Very bad—though it might have been worse.—Playing a most dangerous game.
A boyish scheme, indeed!—I cannot comprehend a man’s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument’s coming if she could.” After this, he made some progress without any pause.
I have another person’s interest at present so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.
Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on one subject.” The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the happiness of her father.
She was sensible of all the affection it evinced.
Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley’s marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.
This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield—the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.
Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year.
Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley’s visits; now she could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.
But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.—_My_ representation, you see, has quite appeased her.” And again, on Emma’s merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates’s knitting, she added, in a half whisper, “I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.—Oh!
if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!—Good-bye, good-bye.” CHAPTER XVII Mrs. Weston’s friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl.
The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me.
I could not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.” “I am sure you were of use to me,” cried Emma.
And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is thirteen.” “How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your saucy looks—‘Mr.
In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one.” “What an amiable creature I was!—No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance.” “‘Mr.
“Here is his answer, if you like to see it.” It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage.
“John enters like a brother into my happiness,” continued Mr. Knightley, “but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise.
It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as you think me already.
I am amused by one part of John’s letter—did you notice it?—where he says, that my information did not take him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind.” “If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying.
What has he been judging by?—I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.—But it was so, I suppose.
As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse’s visits, Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.—But how to break it to her father at last!—She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley’s absence, or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.—She was forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too.
She must not appear to think it a misfortune.—With all the spirits she could command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be obtained—which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all—she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person’s company whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.
She was reminded, more than once, of having always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.—But it would not do.
Emma hung about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.—Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?—He would not deny that he did, she was sure.—Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?—Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his letters, who so glad to assist him?—Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?—Would not he like to have him always on the spot?—Yes.
Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome, the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.—To Emma’s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley’s, whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.—They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most serviceable light—first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one—well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse’s mind.—It was agreed upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or other—in another year or two, perhaps—it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place.
And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!—The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband’s plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank and Emma.
Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin.” Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared—and her eyes, in eager gaze, said, “No, this is impossible!” but her lips were closed.
Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.—She will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman’s language can make interesting.—In our communications we deal only in the great.—However, I must say, that Robert Martin’s heart seemed for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their box at Astley’s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy.” He stopped.—Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.
Her silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while, he added, “Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.
how peculiarly unprepared I was!—for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him, much more, than she was before.” “You ought to know your friend best,” replied Mr. Knightley; “but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.” Emma could not help laughing as she answered, “Upon my word, I believe you know her quite as well as I do.—But, Mr. Knightley, are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him.
I have taken some pains for your sake, and for Robert Martin’s sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her.
I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you—and to give you joy in person.” He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.
Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye—that the whole blunder is spread before her—that she can attend to nothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?” Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet steady voice, “How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!—They _will_ sometimes obtrude—but how you can court them!” He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but Emma’s feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley’s high superiority of character.
But what did such particulars explain?—The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.—Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible to Emma.
She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.
She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;—or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.
Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them, could impair.—Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.—Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.
Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.—The Mr. Churchills were also in town; and they were only waiting for November.
The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by Emma and Mr. Knightley.—They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to allow them the fortnight’s absence in a tour to the seaside, which was the plan.—John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in approving it.
But Mr. Woodhouse—how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to consent?—he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event.
The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary, cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day—and Mr. Elton was called on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Mr. Pickwick journeys to Ipswich and meets with a romantic Adventure with a middle-aged Lady in yellow Curl-papers 23.
On his right sat Mr. Tracy Tupman--the too susceptible Tupman, who to the wisdom and experience of maturer years superadded the enthusiasm and ardour of a boy in the most interesting and pardonable of human weaknesses--love.
Time and feeding had expanded that once romantic form; the black silk waistcoat had become more and more developed; inch by inch had the gold watch-chain beneath it disappeared from within the range of Tupman’s vision; and gradually had the capacious chin encroached upon the borders of the white cravat: but the soul of Tupman had known no change-- admiration of the fair sex was still its ruling passion.
Pickwick observed (says the secretary) that fame was dear to the heart of every man.
Poetic fame was dear to the heart of his friend Snodgrass; the fame of conquest was equally dear to his friend Tupman; and the desire of earning fame in the sports of the field, the air, and the water was uppermost in the breast of his friend Winkle.
Don Bolaro Fizzgig--grandee--only daughter--Donna Christina--splendid creature--loved me to distraction--jealous father-- high-souled daughter--handsome Englishman--Donna Christina in despair-- prussic acid--stomach pump in my portmanteau--operation performed--old Bolaro in ecstasies--consent to our union--join hands and floods of tears--romantic story--very.’ ‘Is the lady in England now, sir?’ inquired Mr. Tupman, on whom the description of her charms had produced a powerful impression.
‘Sudden disappearance--talk of the whole city--search made everywhere without success--public fountain in the great square suddenly ceased playing--weeks elapsed-- still a stoppage--workmen employed to clean it--water drawn off--father- in-law discovered sticking head first in the main pipe, with a full confession in his right boot--took him out, and the fountain played away again, as well as ever.’ ‘Will you allow me to note that little romance down, Sir?’ said Mr. Snodgrass, deeply affected.
Colonel Bulder and Lady Clubber was of the most affectionate description; Colonel Bulder and Sir Thomas Clubber exchanged snuff-boxes, and looked very much like a pair of Alexander Selkirks--‘Monarchs of all they surveyed.’ While the aristocracy of the place--the Bulders, and Clubbers, and Snipes--were thus preserving their dignity at the upper end of the room, the other classes of society were imitating their example in other parts of it.
‘Very good,’ replied Mr. Winkle, thinking in his heart it was very bad.
‘To be before the footlights,’ continued the dismal man, ‘is like sitting at a grand court show, and admiring the silken dresses of the gaudy throng; to be behind them is to be the people who make that finery, uncared for and unknown, and left to sink or swim, to starve or live, as fortune wills it.’ ‘Certainly,’ said Mr. Snodgrass: for the sunken eye of the dismal man rested on him, and he felt it necessary to say something.
There’s something in her eyes wakes such a dreadful fear in my heart, that it drives me mad.
‘I took the seat I had occupied the night before, and there I sat for hours, listening to sounds which must strike deep to the heart of the most callous among human beings--the awful ravings of a dying man.
In an open barouche, the horses of which had been taken out, the better to accommodate it to the crowded place, stood a stout old gentleman, in a blue coat and bright buttons, corduroy breeches and top-boots, two young ladies in scarfs and feathers, a young gentleman apparently enamoured of one of the young ladies in scarfs and feathers, a lady of doubtful age, probably the aunt of the aforesaid, and Mr. Tupman, as easy and unconcerned as if he had belonged to the family from the first moments of his infancy.
‘How dear Emily is flirting with the strange gentleman,’ whispered the spinster aunt, with true spinster-aunt-like envy, to her brother, Mr. Wardle.
‘Do you think my dear nieces pretty?’ whispered their affectionate aunt to Mr. Tupman.
You cannot think how wretched it makes me sometimes--I’m sure I cry about it for hours together--my dear brother is _so_ good, and so unsuspicious, that he never sees it; if he did, I’m quite certain it would break his heart.
I wish I could think it was only manner--I hope it may be--’ (Here the affectionate relative heaved a deep sigh, and shook her head despondingly).
aunt, dear!’ ‘Yes, my dear love!’ ‘I’m _so_ afraid you’ll catch cold, aunt--have a silk handkerchief to tie round your dear old head--you really should take care of yourself-- consider your age!’ However well deserved this piece of retaliation might have been, it was as vindictive a one as could well have been resorted to.
Suppose I forward you a curious manuscript--observe, not curious because wild or improbable, but curious as a leaf from the romance of real life--would you communicate it to the club, of which you have spoken so frequently?’ ‘Certainly,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, ‘if you wished it; and it would be entered on their transactions.’ ‘You shall have it,’ replied the dismal man.
‘Winkle, will you go on horseback?’ Now Mr. Winkle did entertain considerable misgivings in the very lowest recesses of his own heart, relative to his equestrian skill; but, as he would not have them even suspected, on any account, he at once replied with great hardihood, ‘Certainly.
‘Come along, then;’ and the party having traversed several dark passages, and being joined by Mr. Tupman, who had lingered behind to snatch a kiss from Emma, for which he had been duly rewarded with sundry pushings and scratchings, arrived at the parlour door.
And the benevolent clergyman looked pleasantly on; for the happy faces which surrounded the table made the good old man feel happy too; and though the merriment was rather boisterous, still it came from the heart and not from the lips; and this is the right sort of merriment, after all.
‘You must excuse my talking about this old place, Mr. Pickwick,’ resumed the host, after a short pause, ‘for I love it dearly, and know no other- -the old houses and fields seem like living friends to me; and so does our little church with the ivy, about which, by the bye, our excellent friend there made a song when he first came amongst us.
Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings, And a staunch old heart has he.
And slily he traileth along the ground, And his leaves he gently waves, As he joyously hugs and crawleth round The rich mould of dead men’s graves.
Heaven forgive me the supposition, if it be an uncharitable one, but I do firmly and in my soul believe, that the man systematically tried for many years to break her heart; but she bore it all for her child’s sake, and, however strange it may seem to many, for his father’s too; for brute as he was, and cruelly as he had treated her, she had loved him once; and the recollection of what he had been to her, awakened feelings of forbearance and meekness under suffering in her bosom, to which all God’s creatures, but women, are strangers.
‘Shall I tell you that the young man, who, looking back to the earliest of his childhood’s days to which memory and consciousness extended, and carrying his recollection down to that moment, could remember nothing which was not in some way connected with a long series of voluntary privations suffered by his mother for his sake, with ill-usage, and insult, and violence, and all endured for him--shall I tell you, that he, with a reckless disregard for her breaking heart, and a sullen, wilful forgetfulness of all she had done and borne for him, had linked himself with depraved and abandoned men, and was madly pursuing a headlong career, which must bring death to him, and shame to her?
‘The wild and piercing shriek from a woman’s voice, which resounded through the court when the solemn sentence was pronounced, rings in my ears at this moment.
That cry struck a terror to the culprit’s heart, which trial, condemnation--the approach of death itself, had failed to awaken.
I knew that her heart was breaking from that hour; but I never once heard complaint or murmur escape her lips.
‘It was a piteous spectacle to see that woman in the prison-yard from day to day, eagerly and fervently attempting, by affection and entreaty, to soften the hard heart of her obdurate son.
The man’s heart swelled as he crossed the stile.
He remembered how he used to look up into her pale face; and how her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she gazed upon his features--tears which fell hot upon his forehead as she stooped to kiss him, and made him weep too, although he little knew then what bitter tears hers were.
He thought how often he had run merrily down that path with some childish playfellow, looking back, ever and again, to catch his mother’s smile, or hear her gentle voice; and then a veil seemed lifted from his memory, and words of kindness unrequited, and warnings despised, and promises broken, thronged upon his recollection till his heart failed him, and he could bear it no longer.
‘The last soft light of the setting sun had fallen on the earth, casting a rich glow on the yellow corn sheaves, and lengthening the shadows of the orchard trees, as he stood before the old house--the home of his infancy--to which his heart had yearned with an intensity of affection not to be described, through long and weary years of captivity and sorrow.
The sad reality struck coldly at his heart, and his spirit sank within him.
Isabella and Emily had strolled out with Mr. Trundle; the deaf old lady had fallen asleep in her chair; the snoring of the fat boy, penetrated in a low and monotonous sound from the distant kitchen; the buxom servants were lounging at the side door, enjoying the pleasantness of the hour, and the delights of a flirtation, on first principles, with certain unwieldy animals attached to the farm; and there sat the interesting pair, uncared for by all, caring for none, and dreaming only of themselves; there they sat, in short, like a pair of carefully-folded kid gloves--bound up in each other.
say you love me.’ ‘Mr.
He jumped up, and, throwing his arm round the neck of the spinster aunt, imprinted upon her lips numerous kisses, which after a due show of struggling and resistance, she received so passively, that there is no telling how many more Mr. Tupman might have bestowed, if the lady had not given a very unaffected start, and exclaimed in an affrighted tone-- ‘Mr.
His head dropped upon his breast; and, muttering his invincible determination not to go to his bed, and a sanguinary regret that he had not ‘done for old Tupman’ in the morning, he fell fast asleep; in which condition he was borne to his apartment by two young giants under the personal superintendence of the fat boy, to whose protecting care Mr. Snodgrass shortly afterwards confided his own person, Mr. Pickwick accepted the proffered arm of Mr. Tupman and quietly disappeared, smiling more than ever; and Mr. Wardle, after taking as affectionate a leave of the whole family as if he were ordered for immediate execution, consigned to Mr. Trundle the honour of conveying him upstairs, and retired, with a very futile attempt to look impressively solemn and dignified.
It was a remarkable coincidence perhaps, but it was nevertheless a fact, that Mr. Jingle within five minutes of his arrival at Manor Farm on the preceding night, had inwardly resolved to lay siege to the heart of the spinster aunt, without delay.
‘Yes, ma’am--damn that Joe!--treacherous dog, Joe--told the old lady-- old lady furious--wild--raving--arbour--Tupman--kissing and hugging--all that sort of thing--eh, ma’am--eh?’ ‘Mr.
remove my unhappiness, and your love bestowed upon a man who is insensible to the blessing--who even now contemplates a design upon the affections of the niece of the creature who--but no; he is my friend; I will not expose his vices.
‘More than that,’ said Jingle--‘loves another.’ ‘Another!’ ejaculated the spinster.
‘I will.’ ‘You’ll show your spirit?’ ‘I will.’ You’ll not have him afterwards?’ ‘Never.’ ‘You’ll take somebody else?’ Yes.’ ‘You shall.’ Mr. Jingle fell on his knees, remained thereupon for five minutes thereafter; and rose the accepted lover of the spinster aunt-- conditionally upon Mr. Tupman’s perjury being made clear and manifest.
Not a word, not a look, not a glance, did he bestow upon his heart’s pride of the evening before.
‘Splendid--capital--couldn’t act better myself--you must repeat the part to-morrow--every evening till further notice.’ ‘Does Rachael still wish it?’ ‘Of course--she don’t like it--but must be done--avert suspicion--afraid of her brother--says there’s no help for it--only a few days more--when old folks blinded--crown your happiness.’ ‘Any message?’ ‘Love--best love--kindest regards--unalterable affection.
Can I say anything for you?’ ‘My dear fellow,’ replied the unsuspicious Mr. Tupman, fervently grasping his ‘friend’s’ hand--‘carry my best love--say how hard I find it to dissemble--say anything that’s kind: but add how sensible I am of the necessity of the suggestion she made to me, through you, this morning.
He stopped short, as if suddenly recollecting something, and said--‘By the bye--can’t spare ten pounds, can you?--very particular purpose--pay you in three days.’ ‘I dare say I can,’ replied Mr. Tupman, in the fulness of his heart.
ha!’ replied Jingle; and then he added, with a knowing wink, and a jerk of the thumb towards the interior of the chaise--‘I say--she’s very well--desires her compliments--begs you won’t trouble yourself--love to _Tuppy_--won’t you get up behind?--drive on, boys.’ The postillions resumed their proper attitudes, and away rattled the chaise, Mr. Jingle fluttering in derision a white handkerchief from the coach window.
He drew his breath hard, and coloured up to the very tips of his spectacles, as he said, slowly and emphatically-- ‘If ever I meet that man again, I’ll--’ ‘Yes, yes,’ interrupted Wardle, ‘that’s all very well; but while we stand talking here, they’ll get their licence, and be married in London.’ Mr. Pickwick paused, bottled up his vengeance, and corked it down.
My father pulls up, and thinks a bit--“No,” says he, “damme, I’m too old, b’sides, I’m a many sizes too large,” says he.--“Not a bit on it, Sir,” says the touter.-- “Think not?” says my father.--“I’m sure not,” says he; “we married a gen’l’m’n twice your size, last Monday.”--“Did you, though?” said my father.--“To be sure, we did,” says the touter, “you’re a babby to him-- this way, sir--this way!”--and sure enough my father walks arter him, like a tame monkey behind a horgan, into a little back office, vere a teller sat among dirty papers, and tin boxes, making believe he was busy.
‘Run on--nothing to the hours, days, weeks, months, years, when we’re united--run on--they’ll fly on--bolt--mizzle--steam-engine--thousand- horse power--nothing to it.’ ‘Can’t--can’t we be married before to-morrow morning?’ inquired Rachael.
‘Long away from you?--Cruel charmer,’ and Mr. Jingle skipped playfully up to the spinster aunt, imprinted a chaste kiss upon her lips, and danced out of the room.
‘Poor dear.’ And with sundry ejaculations of ‘Come now, there’s a dear--drink a little of this--it’ll do you good--don’t give way so--there’s a love,’ etc.
The shaft had reached him, penetrated through his philosophical harness, to his very heart.
Mr. Pickwick kissed the young ladies--we were going to say, as if they were his own daughters, only, as he might possibly have infused a little more warmth into the salutation, the comparison would not be quite appropriate--hugged the old lady with filial cordiality; and patted the rosy cheeks of the female servants in a most patriarchal manner, as he slipped into the hands of each some more substantial expression of his approval.
Many a backward look they gave at the farm, as they walked slowly away; and many a kiss did Mr. Snodgrass waft in the air, in acknowledgment of something very like a lady’s handkerchief, which was waved from one of the upper windows, until a turn of the lane hid the old house from their sight.
How that word would have struck to my heart, many years ago!
How I used to hug myself with delight, when I thought of the fine trick I was playing them after their old pointing and leering, when I was not mad, but only dreading that I might one day become so!
I could have screamed with ecstasy when I dined alone with some fine roaring fellow, to think how pale he would have turned, and how fast he would have run, if he had known that the dear friend who sat close to him, sharpening a bright, glittering knife, was a madman with all the power, and half the will, to plunge it in his heart.
How I was courted!
I was rich; and when I married the girl, I saw a smile of triumph play upon the faces of her needy relatives, as they thought of their well-planned scheme, and their fine prize.
They little thought they had married her to a madman.
I should have known that her heart was with the dark-eyed boy whose name I once heard her breathe in her troubled sleep; and that she had been sacrificed to me, to relieve the poverty of the old, white-headed man and the haughty brothers.
the blood chills at my heart as I write it down--that form is _her’s_; the face is very pale, and the eyes are glassy bright; but I know them well.
She loved another.
This was the man who had been the main instrument in forcing his sister to wed me; well knowing that her heart was given to that puling boy.
‘“You villain,” said I, “I found you out: I discovered your hellish plots against me; I know her heart was fixed on some one else before you compelled her to marry me.
‘I screamed rather than talked, for I felt tumultuous passions eddying through my veins, and the old spirits whispering and taunting me to tear his heart out.
‘Bless his heart!’ interposed Mrs. Bardell, with a maternal sob.
The astonishment of the Pickwickians was so absorbing, and the perplexity of Mr. Pickwick was so extreme, that they might have remained in exactly the same relative situations until the suspended animation of the lady was restored, had it not been for a most beautiful and touching expression of filial affection on the part of her youthful son.
And downstairs she was led accordingly, accompanied by her affectionate son.
It appears, then, that the Eatanswill people, like the people of many other small towns, considered themselves of the utmost and most mighty importance, and that every man in Eatanswill, conscious of the weight that attached to his example, felt himself bound to unite, heart and soul, with one of the two great parties that divided the town--the Blues and the Buffs.
‘I wish, my dear, you would endeavour to find some topic of conversation in which these gentlemen might take some rational interest.’ ‘But, my love,’ said Mr. Pott, with great humility, ‘Mr.
The noise and bustle which ushered in the morning were sufficient to dispel from the mind of the most romantic visionary in existence, any associations but those which were immediately connected with the rapidly-approaching election.
‘Lord bless your heart, sir,’ said Sam, ‘why where was you half baptised?--that’s nothin’, that ain’t.’ ‘Nothing?’said Mr. Pickwick.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>‘And, perhaps, my dear Sir,’ said the cautious little man, ‘perhaps if you could--I don’t mean to say it’s indispensable--but if you could manage to kiss one of ‘em, it would produce a very great impression on the crowd.’ ‘Wouldn’t it have as good an effect if the proposer or seconder did that?’ said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey.
‘He has kissed one of ‘em!’ exclaimed the delighted little man.
‘He has kissed another,’ gasped the excited manager.
‘He’s kissing ‘em all!’ screamed the enthusiastic little gentleman, and hailed by the deafening shouts of the multitude, the procession moved on.
‘There,’ said Mr. Tupman, ‘on the top of that house.’ And there, sure enough, in the leaden gutter of a tiled roof, were Mr. Winkle and Mrs. Pott, comfortably seated in a couple of chairs, waving their handkerchiefs in token of recognition--a compliment which Mr. Pickwick returned by kissing his hand to the lady.
‘Putting on his spectacles to look at a married ‘ooman!’ said a third.
‘Are you married?’ inquired the dirty-faced man.
‘In less than five minutes’ time, Tom was ensconced in the room opposite the bar--the very room where he had imagined the fire blazing--before a substantial, matter-of-fact, roaring fire, composed of something short of a bushel of coals, and wood enough to make half a dozen decent gooseberry bushes, piled half-way up the chimney, and roaring and crackling with a sound that of itself would have warmed the heart of any reasonable man.
‘Tom Smart was by no means of an irritable or envious disposition, but somehow or other the tall man with the brown coat and the bright basket buttons did rouse what little gall he had in his composition, and did make him feel extremely indignant, the more especially as he could now and then observe, from his seat before the glass, certain little affectionate familiarities passing between the tall man and the widow, which sufficiently denoted that the tall man was as high in favour as he was in size.
‘Up a wide and ancient staircase the smart girl preceded Tom, shading the chamber candle with her hand, to protect it from the currents of air which in such a rambling old place might have found plenty of room to disport themselves in, without blowing the candle out, but which did blow it out nevertheless--thus affording Tom’s enemies an opportunity of asserting that it was he, and not the wind, who extinguished the candle, and that while he pretended to be blowing it alight again, he was in fact kissing the girl.
‘“Tom,” said the old gentleman, “the widow’s a fine woman--remarkably fine woman--eh, Tom?” Here the old fellow screwed up his eyes, cocked up one of his wasted little legs, and looked altogether so unpleasantly amorous, that Tom was quite disgusted with the levity of his behaviour-- at his time of life, too!
I want you to marry the widow.” ‘“Me, Sir!” said Tom.
‘“The kissing behind the door, and all that sort of thing, Tom,” said the old gentleman.
None of your modern abortions--all with arms, and with a degree of polish, though I say it that should not, which it would have done your heart good to behold.” ‘“And what’s become of the others, Sir?” asked Tom Smart-- ‘The old gentleman applied his elbow to his eye as he replied, “Gone, Tom, gone.
The moment he married the widow, he would sell off all the furniture, and run away.
‘“I am sure I am very much obliged to you, Sir, for your good opinion,” said the buxom landlady, half laughing; “and if ever I marry again--” ’”_If_,” said Tom Smart, looking very shrewdly out of the right-hand corner of his left eye.
‘Gentlemen, I have heard my uncle say, that Tom Smart said the widow’s lamentations when she heard the disclosure would have pierced a heart of stone.
“I shall never find anyone else I can love so much!” ‘“Oh, yes you will, my dear soul,” said Tom Smart, letting fall a shower of the largest-sized tears, in pity for the widow’s misfortunes.
‘I never could find out, gentlemen, whether Tom did or did not kiss the widow at that particular moment.
‘At all events, Tom kicked the very tall man out at the front door half an hour later, and married the widow a month after.
She adores it; I may say that her whole soul and mind are wound up, and entwined with it.
You’ll do very well there, won’t you--dear?’ ‘Certainly--love,’ replied the unhappy Pott, with a grim smile.
‘Sights, sir,’ resumed Mr. Weller, ‘as ‘ud penetrate your benevolent heart, and come out on the other side.
‘Let me order you a snug little dinner, and make my inquiries below while it’s a-getting ready; I could worm ev’ry secret out O’ the boots’s heart, in five minutes, Sir.’ Do so,’ said Mr. Pickwick; and Mr. Weller at once retired.
‘Bless your heart, sir, servants always do,’ replied Mr. Weller.
Mr. Trotter smiled, and holding his glass in his left hand, gave four distinct slaps on the pockets of his mulberry indescribables with his right, as if to intimate that his master might have done the same without alarming anybody much by the chinking of coin.
‘And he has so wound himself round the old lady’s heart, Sir,’ resumed Job, ‘that she would believe nothing to his prejudice, if you went down on your bare knees, and swore it; especially as you have no proof but the word of a servant, who, for anything she knows (and my master would be sure to say so), was discharged for some fault, and does this in revenge.’ ‘What had better be done, then?’ said Mr. Pickwick.
‘You’re a fine fellow,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘and I admire your goodness of heart.
How do you do it?’ ‘It comes from the heart, Mr. Walker,’ replied Job solemnly.
No wonder then, that Nathaniel Pipkin was unable to take his eyes from the countenance of Miss Lobbs; no wonder that Miss Lobbs, finding herself stared at by a young man, withdrew her head from the window out of which she had been peeping, and shut the casement and pulled down the blind; no wonder that Nathaniel Pipkin, immediately thereafter, fell upon the young urchin who had previously offended, and cuffed and knocked him about to his heart’s content.
‘It _is_ matter of wonder, though, that anyone of Mr. Nathaniel Pipkin’s retiring disposition, nervous temperament, and most particularly diminutive income, should from this day forth, have dared to aspire to the hand and heart of the only daughter of the fiery old Lobbs--of old Lobbs, the great saddler, who could have bought up the whole village at one stroke of his pen, and never felt the outlay--old Lobbs, who was well known to have heaps of money, invested in the bank at the nearest market town--who was reported to have countless and inexhaustible treasures hoarded up in the little iron safe with the big keyhole, over the chimney-piece in the back parlour--and who, it was well known, on festive occasions garnished his board with a real silver teapot, cream- ewer, and sugar-basin, which he was wont, in the pride of his heart, to boast should be his daughter’s property when she found a man to her mind.
But love is blind; and Nathaniel had a cast in his eye; and perhaps these two circumstances, taken together, prevented his seeing the matter in its proper light.
This was delightful, and gladdening to the heart of Nathaniel Pipkin.
At last, one day when he knew old Lobbs was out, Nathaniel Pipkin had the temerity to kiss his hand to Maria Lobbs; and Maria Lobbs, instead of shutting the window, and pulling down the blind, kissed _hers _to him, and smiled.
‘A prettier foot, a gayer heart, a more dimpled face, or a smarter form, never bounded so lightly over the earth they graced, as did those of Maria Lobbs, the old saddler’s daughter.
‘Nathaniel Pipkin’s heart beat high within him, when he saw this enticing little couple some hundred yards before him one summer’s evening, in the very field in which he had many a time strolled about till night-time, and pondered on the beauty of Maria Lobbs.
There was something in Kate’s manner that was not to be resisted, and so Nathaniel Pipkin complied with the invitation; and after a great deal of blushing on his part, and immoderate laughter on that of the wicked little cousin, Nathaniel Pipkin went down on his knees on the dewy grass, and declared his resolution to remain there for ever, unless he were permitted to rise the accepted lover of Maria Lobbs.
At length, Maria Lobbs being more strenuously urged by the love-worn little man, turned away her head, and whispered her cousin to say, or at all events Kate did say, that she felt much honoured by Mr. Pipkin’s addresses; that her hand and heart were at her father’s disposal; but that nobody could be insensible to Mr. Pipkin’s merits.
As all this was said with much gravity, and as Nathaniel Pipkin walked home with Maria Lobbs, and struggled for a kiss at parting, he went to bed a happy man, and dreamed all night long, of softening old Lobbs, opening the strong box, and marrying Maria.
It’s a delightful thing to see affection in families, but it may be carried rather too far, and Nathaniel Pipkin could not help thinking that Maria Lobbs must be very particularly fond of her relations, if she paid as much attention to all of them as to this individual cousin.
And though the wicked little cousin and the other girls pinched him, and pulled his hair, and pushed chairs in his way, and all sorts of things, Maria Lobbs never seemed to come near him at all; and once--once--Nathaniel Pipkin could have sworn he heard the sound of a kiss, followed by a faint remonstrance from Maria Lobbs, and a half-suppressed laugh from her female friends.
At length some supper, which had been warming up, was placed on the table, and then old Lobbs fell to, in regular style; and having made clear work of it in no time, kissed his daughter, and demanded his pipe.
I love her, Mr. Lobbs.” ‘“Why, you snivelling, wry-faced, puny villain,” gasped old Lobbs, paralysed by the atrocious confession; “what do you mean by that?
I love your daughter, sir; and I came here for the purpose of meeting her.” ‘Old Lobbs opened his eyes very wide at this, but not wider than Nathaniel Pipkin.
He soon recovered the effects of his attachment, for we find his name in the parish register, as a witness to the marriage of Maria Lobbs to her cousin; and it also appears, by reference to other documents, that on the night of the wedding he was incarcerated in the village cage, for having, in a state of extreme intoxication, committed sundry excesses in the streets, in all of which he was aided and abetted by the bony apprentice with the thin legs.’ CHAPTER XVIII.
if you’d known How false she’d have grown, When you heard the marriage bells tinkle; You’d have done then, I vow, What you cannot help now, ‘What,’ said Mr. Pott solemnly--‘what rhymes to “tinkle,” villain?’ ‘What rhymes to tinkle?’ said Mrs. Pott, whose entrance at the moment forestalled the reply.
‘If you only knew how I have loved that man--’ Don’t distress yourself by recollecting it, ma’am,’ said the bodyguard.
Does it not, I ask, bespeak the indiscretion, or, worse than that, the blackness of heart--that I should say so!--of my followers, that, beneath whatever roof they locate, they disturb the peace of mind and happiness of some confiding female?
Sir, Having been instructed by Mrs. Martha Bardell to commence an action against you for a breach of promise of marriage, for which the plaintiff lays her damages at fifteen hundred pounds, we beg to inform you that a writ has been issued against you in this suit in the Court of Common Pleas; and request to know, by return of post, the name of your attorney in London, who will accept service thereof.
Mrs. Bardell would never do it;--she hasn’t the heart to do it;--she hasn’t the case to do it.
Ridiculous--ridiculous.’ Of her heart,’ said Wardle, with a smile, ‘you should certainly be the best judge.
“What a number o’ cats you keep, Mr. Brooks,” says I, when I’d got intimate with him.

SHOWING HOW DODSON AND FOGG WERE MEN OF BUSINESS, AND THEIR CLERKS MEN OF PLEASURE; AND HOW AN AFFECTING INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE BETWEEN MR. WELLER AND HIS LONG-LOST PARENT; SHOWING ALSO WHAT CHOICE SPIRITS ASSEMBLED AT THE MAGPIE AND STUMP, AND WHAT A CAPITAL CHAPTER THE NEXT ONE WILL BE In the ground-floor front of a dingy house, at the very farthest end of Freeman’s Court, Cornhill, sat the four clerks of Messrs. Dodson &amp; Fogg, two of his Majesty’s attorneys of the courts of King’s Bench and Common Pleas at Westminster, and solicitors of the High Court of Chancery--the aforesaid clerks catching as favourable glimpses of heaven’s light and heaven’s sun, in the course of their daily labours, as a man might hope to do, were he placed at the bottom of a reasonably deep well; and without the opportunity of perceiving the stars in the day-time, which the latter secluded situation affords.
There was a glass door leading into the passage which formed the entrance to the court, and on the outer side of this glass door, Mr. Pickwick, closely followed by Sam Weller, presented himself on the Friday morning succeeding the occurrence of which a faithful narration is given in the last chapter.
If you want to ease your mind by blowing up somebody, come out into the court and blow up me; but it’s rayther too expensive work to be carried on here.’ And without the slightest ceremony, Mr. Weller hauled his master down the stairs, and down the court, and having safely deposited him in Cornhill, fell behind, prepared to follow whithersoever he should lead.
He replied, without the slightest consideration-- ‘Second court on the right hand side--last house but vun on the same side the vay--take the box as stands in the first fireplace, ‘cos there ain’t no leg in the middle o’ the table, which all the others has, and it’s wery inconvenient.’ Mr. Pickwick observed his valet’s directions implicitly, and bidding Sam follow him, entered the tavern he had pointed out, where the hot brandy- and-water was speedily placed before him; while Mr. Weller, seated at a respectful distance, though at the same table with his master, was accommodated with a pint of porter.
‘How are you, my ancient?’ And with this beautiful ebullition of filial affection, Mr. Weller made room on the seat beside him, for the stout man, who advanced pipe in mouth and pot in hand, to greet him.
If ever you’re attacked with the gout, sir, jist you marry a widder as has got a good loud woice, with a decent notion of usin’ it, and you’ll never have the gout agin.
If you just go to the Magpie and Stump, and ask at the bar for Mr. Lowten, they’ll show you in to him, and he’s Mr. Perker’s clerk.’ With this direction, and having been furthermore informed that the hostelry in question was situated in a court, happy in the double advantage of being in the vicinity of Clare Market, and closely approximating to the back of New Inn, Mr. Pickwick and Sam descended the rickety staircase in safety, and issued forth in quest of the Magpie and Stump.
There is not a panel in the old wainscotting, but what, if it were endowed with the powers of speech and memory, could start from the wall, and tell its tale of horror--the romance of life, Sir, the romance of life!
Common-place as they may seem now, I tell you they are strange old places, and I would rather hear many a legend with a terrific-sounding name, than the true history of one old set of chambers.’ There was something so odd in the old man’s sudden energy, and the subject which had called it forth, that Mr. Pickwick was prepared with no observation in reply; and the old man checking his impetuosity, and resuming the leer, which had disappeared during his previous excitement, said-- ‘Look at them in another light--their most common-place and least romantic.
there’s romance enough at home without going half a mile for it; only people never think of it.’ ‘I never thought of the romance of this particular subject before, certainly,’ said Mr. Pickwick, laughing.
The atrocity in its full extent no longer exists, but there is enough of it left to give rise to occurrences that make the heart bleed.
The hard realities of the world, with many of its worst privations--hunger and thirst, and cold and want--had all come home to him, from the first dawnings of reason; and though the form of childhood was there, its light heart, its merry laugh, and sparkling eyes were wanting.
The child’s young heart was breaking.
A silent look of affection and regard when all other eyes are turned coldly away--the consciousness that we possess the sympathy and affection of one being when all others have deserted us--is a hold, a stay, a comfort, in the deepest affliction, which no wealth could purchase, or power bestow.
They had seen him pine away, from day to day; and though his brief existence had been a joyless one, and he was now removed to that peace and rest which, child as he was, he had never known in this world, they were his parents, and his loss sank deep into their souls.
who _had _let those who were far dearer to him than his own existence die of want, and sickness of heart that medicine cannot cure--had been found dead in his bed of down.
He had had all the heart to leave his son a beggar, but proud even of his health and strength, had put off the act till it was too late, and now might gnash his teeth in the other world, at the thought of the wealth his remissness had left him.
‘“Hasten here, Sir, in God’s name; help, help, sir, for the love of Heaven.
MR. PICKWICK JOURNEYS TO IPSWICH AND MEETS WITH A ROMANTIC ADVENTURE WITH A MIDDLE-AGED LADY IN YELLOW CURL-PAPERS That ‘ere your governor’s luggage, Sammy?’ inquired Mr. Weller of his affectionate son, as he entered the yard of the Bull Inn, Whitechapel, with a travelling-bag and a small portmanteau.
“The kiss of peace,” says the shepherd; and then he kissed the women all round, and ven he’d done, the man vith the red nose began.
In hasty notes to intimate acquaintance, I sometimes sign myself “Afternoon.” It amuses my friends very much, Mr. Pickwick.’ ‘It is calculated to afford them the highest gratification, I should conceive,’ said Mr. Pickwick, rather envying the ease with which Mr. Magnus’s friends were entertained.
The man with the horrible face looked, with the greatest surprise, up the court, and down the court, and in at the windows of the houses-- everywhere but at Sam Weller--and took another step forward, when he was brought to again by another shout.
Well, Sir, I met her at a chapel that I go to; a very neat little chapel in this town, Mr. Weller, where they sing the number four collection of hymns, which I generally carry about with me, in a little book, which you may perhaps have seen in my hand--and I got a little intimate with her, Mr. Weller, and from that, an acquaintance sprung up between us, and I may venture to say, Mr. Weller, that I am to be the chandler.’ ‘Ah, and a wery amiable chandler you’ll make,’ replied Sam, eyeing Job with a side look of intense dislike.
I should then expatiate on the warmth of my love, and the depth of my devotion.
‘Upon this, sir, I should squeeze her hand, and I think--I think, Mr. Magnus--that after I had done that, supposing there was no refusal, I should gently draw away the handkerchief, which my slight knowledge of human nature leads me to suppose the lady would be applying to her eyes at the moment, and steal a respectful kiss.
I think I should kiss her, Mr. Magnus; and at this particular point, I am decidedly of opinion that if the lady were going to take me at all, she would murmur into my ears a bashful acceptance.’ Mr. Magnus started; gazed on Mr. Pickwick’s intelligent face, for a short time in silence; and then (the dial pointing to the ten minutes past) shook him warmly by the hand, and rushed desperately from the room.
Pickwick, she is mine.’ ‘I congratulate you, with all my heart,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, warmly shaking his new friend by the hand.
‘Fifty pounds each,’ whispered Jinks, ‘and householders, of course.’ ‘I shall require two sureties of fifty pounds each,’ said the magistrate aloud, with great dignity, ‘and they must be householders, of course.’ ‘But bless my heart, Sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick, who, together with Mr. Tupman, was all amazement and indignation; ‘we are perfect strangers in this town.
‘My love,’ said Mr. Nupkins, ‘you professed yourself very fond of Captain Fitz-Marshall.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>‘Put your lips to this here tumbler, and then I can kiss you by deputy.’ ‘For shame, Mr. Weller!’ said Mary.
‘Well, now,’ said Sam, ‘afore these here ladies, I should jest like to ask you, as a sort of curiosity, whether you don’t consider yourself as nice and well-behaved a young gen’l’m’n, as ever used a pink check pocket-handkerchief, and the number four collection?’ ‘And as was ever a-going to be married to a cook,’ said that lady indignantly.
Having accomplished this feat with all the ardour which her devoted love for Mr. Muzzle inspired, she staggered back; and being a lady of very excitable and delicate feelings, she instantly fell under the dresser, and fainted away.
‘Tall young man--old lover--Sidney Porkenham--rich--fine fellow--not so rich as captain, though, eh?--turn him away--off with him--anything for captain--nothing like captain anywhere--all the girls--raving mad--eh, Job, eh?’ Here Mr. Jingle laughed very heartily; and Job, rubbing his hands with delight, uttered the first sound he had given vent to since he entered the house--a low, noiseless chuckle, which seemed to intimate that he enjoyed his laugh too much, to let any of it escape in sound.
‘I might,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘have taken a much greater revenge for the treatment I have experienced at your hands, and that of your hypocritical friend there.’ Job Trotter bowed with great politeness, and laid his hand upon his heart.
ha!’ said Jingle, ‘good fellow, Pickwick--fine heart--stout old boy--but must _not _be passionate--bad thing, very--bye, bye--see you again some day--keep up your spirits--now, Job--trot!’ With these words, Mr. Jingle stuck on his hat in his old fashion, and strode out of the room.
Whether it was that the pretty housemaid’s face looked prettier still, when it was raised towards Sam’s, or whether it was the accidental consequence of their being so near to each other, is matter of uncertainty to this day; but Sam kissed her.
‘No, I didn’t then,’ said Sam; ‘but I will now.’ So he kissed her again.
And this was the first passage of Mr. Weller’s first love.
Why don’t he marry her?’ ‘Ah,’ said Sam, ‘to be sure; that’s the question.’ ‘Question, indeed,’ retorted Mrs. Cluppins, ‘she’d question him, if she’d my spirit.
‘And of them Dodson and Foggs, as does these sort o’ things on spec,’ continued Mr. Weller, ‘as vell as for the other kind and gen’rous people o’ the same purfession, as sets people by the ears, free gratis for nothin’, and sets their clerks to work to find out little disputes among their neighbours and acquaintances as vants settlin’ by means of lawsuits--all I can say o’ them is, that I vish they had the reward I’d give ‘em.’ ‘Ah, I wish they had the reward that every kind and generous heart would be inclined to bestow upon them!’ said the gratified Mrs. Bardell.
An interview with Mr. Perker, next day, more than confirmed Mr. Weller’s statement; and Mr. Pickwick was fain to prepare for his Christmas visit to Dingley Dell, with the pleasant anticipation that some two or three months afterwards, an action brought against him for damages sustained by reason of a breach of promise of marriage, would be publicly tried in the Court of Common Pleas; the plaintiff having all the advantages derivable, not only from the force of circumstances, but from the sharp practice of Dodson &amp; Fogg to boot.
It was a remarkably fine day; and he had not turned the matter over in his mind ten minutes, when he was suddenly stricken filial and affectionate; and it occurred to him so strongly that he ought to go down and see his father, and pay his duty to his mother-in-law, that he was lost in astonishment at his own remissness in never thinking of this moral obligation before.
It made a visible impression at once; and Sam followed up his advantage by kissing his mother-in-law.
Sam felt very strongly disposed to give the reverend Mr. Stiggins something to groan for, but he repressed his inclination, and merely asked, ‘What’s the old ‘un up to now?’ ‘Up to, indeed!’ said Mrs. Weller, ‘Oh, he has a hard heart.
Down goes the shepherd to chapel, gives out as he’s a persecuted saint, and says he hopes the heart of the turncock as cut the water off, ‘ll be softened, and turned in the right vay, but he rayther thinks he’s booked for somethin’ uncomfortable.
‘Thank’ee, my love,’ said Mr. Weller.
‘I am ashamed on you!’ said Sam reproachfully; ‘what do you let him show his red nose in the Markis o’ Granby at all, for?’ Mr. Weller the elder fixed on his son an earnest look, and replied, ‘’Cause I’m a married man, Samivel, ‘cause I’m a married man.
Ven you’re a married man, Samivel, you’ll understand a good many things as you don’t understand now; but vether it’s worth while goin’ through so much, to learn so little, as the charity-boy said ven he got to the end of the alphabet, is a matter o’ taste.
It was the sort of afternoon that might induce a couple of elderly gentlemen, in a lonely field, to take off their greatcoats and play at leap-frog in pure lightness of heart and gaiety; and we firmly believe that had Mr. Tupman at that moment proffered ‘a back,’ Mr. Pickwick would have accepted his offer with the utmost avidity.
And when the difficulties of the stile were at last surmounted, and they once more entered on the open field, old Wardle informed Mr. Pickwick how they had all been down in a body to inspect the furniture and fittings-up of the house, which the young couple were to tenant, after the Christmas holidays; at which communication Bella and Trundle both coloured up, as red as the fat boy after the taproom fire; and the young lady with the black eyes and the fur round the boots, whispered something in Emily’s ear, and then glanced archly at Mr. Snodgrass; to which Emily responded that she was a foolish girl, but turned very red, notwithstanding; and Mr. Snodgrass, who was as modest as all great geniuses usually are, felt the crimson rising to the crown of his head, and devoutly wished, in the inmost recesses of his own heart, that the young lady aforesaid, with her black eyes, and her archness, and her boots with the fur round the top, were all comfortably deposited in the adjacent county.
So, she smoothed down the lavender-coloured dress again, and turning to Mr. Pickwick said, ‘Ah, Mr. Pickwick, young people was very different, when I was a girl.’ ‘No doubt of that, ma’am,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘and that’s the reason why I would make much of the few that have any traces of the old stock’--and saying this, Mr. Pickwick gently pulled Bella towards him, and bestowing a kiss upon her forehead, bade her sit down on the little stool at her grandmother’s feet.
Whether the expression of her countenance, as it was raised towards the old lady’s face, called up a thought of old times, or whether the old lady was touched by Mr. Pickwick’s affectionate good- nature, or whatever was the cause, she was fairly melted; so she threw herself on her granddaughter’s neck, and all the little ill-humour evaporated in a gush of silent tears.
A wedding is a licensed subject to joke upon, but there really is no great joke in the matter after all;--we speak merely of the ceremony, and beg it to be distinctly understood that we indulge in no hidden sarcasm upon a married life.
Wardle,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘we old folks must have a glass of wine together, in honour of this joyful event.’ The old lady was in a state of great grandeur just then, for she was sitting at the top of the table in the brocaded gown, with her newly- married granddaughter on one side, and Mr. Pickwick on the other, to do the carving.
Now, Pickwick.’ Amidst the silence of the company, the whispering of the women-servants, and the awkward embarrassment of the men, Mr. Pickwick proceeded-- ‘Ladies and gentlemen--no, I won’t say ladies and gentlemen, I’ll call you my friends, my dear friends, if the ladies will allow me to take so great a liberty--’ Here Mr. Pickwick was interrupted by immense applause from the ladies, echoed by the gentlemen, during which the owner of the eyes was distinctly heard to state that she could kiss that dear Mr. Pickwick.
I wish,’ added Mr. Pickwick-- ‘I wish I was young enough to be her sister’s husband (cheers), but, failing that, I am happy to be old enough to be her father; for, being so, I shall not be suspected of any latent designs when I say, that I admire, esteem, and love them both (cheers and sobs).
That his daughter may enjoy all the happiness, even he can desire; and that he may derive from the contemplation of her felicity all the gratification of heart and peace of mind which he so well deserves, is, I am persuaded, our united wish.
The old lady submitted to this piece of practical politeness with all the dignity which befitted so important and serious a solemnity, but the younger ladies, not being so thoroughly imbued with a superstitious veneration for the custom, or imagining that the value of a salute is very much enhanced if it cost a little trouble to obtain it, screamed and struggled, and ran into corners, and threatened and remonstrated, and did everything but leave the room, until some of the less adventurous gentlemen were on the point of desisting, when they all at once found it useless to resist any longer, and submitted to be kissed with a good grace.
Mr. Winkle kissed the young lady with the black eyes, and Mr. Snodgrass kissed Emily; and Mr. Weller, not being particular about the form of being under the mistletoe, kissed Emma and the other female servants, just as he caught them.
As to the poor relations, they kissed everybody, not even excepting the plainer portions of the young lady visitors, who, in their excessive confusion, ran right under the mistletoe, as soon as it was hung up, without knowing it!
Now, the screaming had subsided, and faces were in a glow, and curls in a tangle, and Mr. Pickwick, after kissing the old lady as before mentioned, was standing under the mistletoe, looking with a very pleased countenance on all that was passing around him, when the young lady with the black eyes, after a little whispering with the other young ladies, made a sudden dart forward, and, putting her arm round Mr. Pickwick’s neck, saluted him affectionately on the left cheek; and before Mr. Pickwick distinctly knew what was the matter, he was surrounded by the whole body, and kissed by every one of them.
It was a pleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick in the centre of the group, now pulled this way, and then that, and first kissed on the chin, and then on the nose, and then on the spectacles, and to hear the peals of laughter which were raised on every side; but it was a still more pleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick, blinded shortly afterwards with a silk handkerchief, falling up against the wall, and scrambling into corners, and going through all the mysteries of blind-man’s buff, with the utmost relish for the game, until at last he caught one of the poor relations, and then had to evade the blind-man himself, which he did with a nimbleness and agility that elicited the admiration and applause of all beholders.
For his darling child is the madness wild That sports in fierce fever’s train; And when love is too strong, it don’t last long, As many have found to their pain.
We’ll usher him in with a merry din That shall gladden his joyous heart, And we’ll keep him up, while there’s bite or sup, And in fellowship good, we’ll part.
‘He _was_ carried away by goblins, Pickwick; and there’s an end of the matter.’ ‘No, no,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘not an end of it, I assure you; for I must hear how, and why, and all about it.’ Wardle smiled, as every head was bent forward to hear, and filling out the wassail with no stinted hand, nodded a health to Mr. Pickwick, and began as follows-- But bless our editorial heart, what a long chapter we have been betrayed into!
It by no means follows that because a man is a sexton, and constantly surrounded by the emblems of mortality, therefore he should be a morose and melancholy man; your undertakers are the merriest fellows in the world; and I once had the honour of being on intimate terms with a mute, who in private life, and off duty, was as comical and jocose a little fellow as ever chirped out a devil-may-care song, without a hitch in his memory, or drained off a good stiff glass without stopping for breath.
All this was gall and wormwood to the heart of Gabriel Grub; and when groups of children bounded out of the houses, tripped across the road, and were met, before they could knock at the opposite door, by half a dozen curly-headed little rascals who crowded round them as they flocked upstairs to spend the evening in their Christmas games, Gabriel smiled grimly, and clutched the handle of his spade with a firmer grasp, as he thought of measles, scarlet fever, thrush, whooping-cough, and a good many other sources of consolation besides.
We know the man who struck the boy in the envious malice of his heart, because the boy could be merry, and he could not.
“You!” He appeared disposed to add more, but indignation choked his utterance, so he lifted up one of his very pliable legs, and, flourishing it above his head a little, to insure his aim, administered a good sound kick to Gabriel Grub; immediately after which, all the goblins in waiting crowded round the wretched sexton, and kicked him without mercy, according to the established and invariable custom of courtiers upon earth, who kick whom royalty kicks, and hug whom royalty hugs.
He saw that women, the tenderest and most fragile of all God’s creatures, were the oftenest superior to sorrow, adversity, and distress; and he saw that it was because they bore, in their own hearts, an inexhaustible well-spring of affection and devotion.
A thrill of hatred struck to Mr. Winkle’s heart, as Bob Sawyer inflicted on the proffered hand a perceptible squeeze.
And when he was knocked down (which happened upon the average every third round), it was the most invigorating sight that can possibly be imagined, to behold him gather up his hat, gloves, and handkerchief, with a glowing countenance, and resume his station in the rank, with an ardour and enthusiasm that nothing Could abate.
But Mr. Pickwick cared not for appearances in such an extreme case, and urged on by Sam Weller, he kept at the very top of his speed until he reached the door of Manor Farm, where Mr. Tupman had arrived some five minutes before, and had frightened the old lady into palpitations of the heart by impressing her with the unalterable conviction that the kitchen chimney was on fire--a calamity which always presented itself in glowing colours to the old lady’s mind, when anybody about her evinced the smallest agitation.
We do not mean to say that it was exactly the case in this particular instance; all we wish to inform the reader is, that the different members of the party dispersed to their several homes; that Mr. Pickwick and his friends once more took their seats on the top of the Muggleton coach; and that Arabella Allen repaired to her place of destination, wherever it might have been--we dare say Mr. Winkle knew, but we confess we don’t--under the care and guardianship of her brother Benjamin, and his most intimate and particular friend, Mr. Bob Sawyer.
‘I suppose, Sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick, his indignation rising while he spoke--‘I suppose, Sir, that it is the intention of your employers to seek to criminate me upon the testimony of my own friends?’ Mr. Jackson struck his forefinger several times against the left side of his nose, to intimate that he was not there to disclose the secrets of the prison house, and playfully rejoined-- ‘Not knowin’, can’t say.’ ‘For what other reason, Sir,’ pursued Mr. Pickwick, ‘are these subpoenas served upon them, if not for this?’ ‘Very good plant, Mr. Pickwick,’ replied Jackson, slowly shaking his head.
‘He’s certain not to be back this week, and it’s a chance whether he will be next; for when Perker once gets out of town, he’s never in a hurry to come back again.’ ‘Out of town!’ said Mr. Pickwick; ‘dear me, how unfortunate!’ ‘Don’t go away, Mr. Pickwick,’ said Lowten, ‘I’ve got a letter for you.’ The stranger, seeming to hesitate, once more looked towards the ground, and the clerk winked slyly at Mr. Pickwick, as if to intimate that some exquisite piece of humour was going forward, though what it was Mr. Pickwick could not for the life of him divine.
‘Good man!’ replied Perker; ‘bless your heart and soul, my dear Sir, Serjeant Snubbin is at the very top of his profession.
Gets treble the business of any man in court--engaged in every case.
You needn’t mention it abroad; but we say--we of the profession--that Serjeant Snubbin leads the court by the nose.’ The little man took another pinch of snuff as he made this communication, and nodded mysteriously to Mr. Pickwick.
The marks of hairpowder on his coat-collar, and the ill-washed and worse tied white neckerchief round his throat, showed that he had not found leisure since he left the court to make any alteration in his dress; while the slovenly style of the remainder of his costume warranted the inference that his personal appearance would not have been very much improved if he had.
Pickwick was anxious to call upon you, Serjeant Snubbin,’ said Perker, ‘to state to you, before you entered upon the case, that he denies there being any ground or pretence whatever for the action against him; and that unless he came into court with clean hands, and without the most conscientious conviction that he was right in resisting the plaintiff’s demand, he would not be there at all.
Did you make that remark to me, sir?’ ‘Why, bless my heart!’ said Mr. Benjamin Allen.
Child’s parents were poor people who lived in a court.
Child thought it capital fun, went back next day, and swallowed another bead.’ ‘Bless my heart,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘what a dreadful thing!
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As well as possible’; the fact being, as we have already hinted, that there was nothing whatever to go on, either well or ill, until the sitting of the court on the following morning.
Having loitered here, for half an hour or so, Mr. Weller turned, and began wending his way towards Leadenhall Market, through a variety of by-streets and courts.
‘To see you married, Sammy--to see you a dilluded wictim, and thinkin’ in your innocence that it’s all wery capital,’ replied Mr. Weller.
‘I ain’t a-goin’ to get married, don’t you fret yourself about that; I know you’re a judge of these things.
There!’ We cannot distinctly say whether it was the prospect of the pipe, or the consolatory reflection that a fatal disposition to get married ran in the family, and couldn’t be helped, which calmed Mr. Weller’s feelings, and caused his grief to subside.
And my ‘pinion is, Sammy, that if your governor don’t prove a alleybi, he’ll be what the Italians call reg’larly flummoxed, and that’s all about it.’ As the elder Mr. Weller entertained a firm and unalterable conviction that the Old Bailey was the supreme court of judicature in this country, and that its rules and forms of proceeding regulated and controlled the practice of all other courts of justice whatsoever, he totally disregarded the assurances and arguments of his son, tending to show that the alibi was inadmissible; and vehemently protested that Mr. Pickwick was being ‘wictimised.’ Finding that it was of no use to discuss the matter further, Sam changed the subject, and inquired what the second topic was, on which his revered parent wished to consult him.
An instance of affection, which had nearly proved fatal to Humm, who, being extremely popular, was all but suffocated, by the crowd of female devotees that hung about his neck, and heaped caresses upon him.
Discontented or hungry jurymen, my dear sir, always find for the plaintiff.’ ‘Bless my heart,’ said Mr. Pickwick, looking very blank, ‘what do they do that for?’ ‘Why, I don’t know,’ replied the little man coolly; ‘saves time, I suppose.
‘Lowten,’ said Perker, when they reached the outer hall of the court, ‘put Mr. Pickwick’s friends in the students’ box; Mr. Pickwick himself had better sit by me.
Mr. Pickwick stood up in a state of great agitation, and took a glance at the court.
That gentleman behind him is Mr. Skimpin, his junior.’ Mr. Pickwick was on the point of inquiring, with great abhorrence of the man’s cold-blooded villainy, how Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, who was counsel for the opposite party, dared to presume to tell Mr. Serjeant Snubbin, who was counsel for him, that it was a fine morning, when he was interrupted by a general rising of the barristers, and a loud cry of ‘Silence!’ from the officers of the court.
The judge had no sooner taken his seat, than the officer on the floor of the court called out ‘Silence!’ in a commanding tone, upon which another officer in the gallery cried ‘Silence!’ in an angry manner, whereupon three or four more ushers shouted ‘Silence!’ in a voice of indignant remonstrance.
You shall well and truly try--’ ‘I beg this court’s pardon,’ said the chemist, who was a tall, thin, yellow-visaged man, ‘but I hope this court will excuse my attendance.’ ‘On what grounds, Sir?’ said Mr. Justice Stareleigh.
Mr. Pickwick was regarding the chemist with feelings of the deepest horror, when a slight sensation was perceptible in the body of the court; and immediately afterwards Mrs. Bardell, supported by Mrs. Cluppins, was led in, and placed, in a drooping state, at the other end of the seat on which Mr. Pickwick sat.
At sight of her child, Mrs. Bardell started; suddenly recollecting herself, she kissed him in a frantic manner; then relapsing into a state of hysterical imbecility, the good lady requested to be informed where she was.
‘Capital fellows those Dodson and Fogg; excellent ideas of effect, my dear Sir, excellent.’ As Perker spoke, Mrs. Bardell began to recover by slow degrees, while Mrs. Cluppins, after a careful survey of Master Bardell’s buttons and the button-holes to which they severally belonged, placed him on the floor of the court in front of his mother--a commanding position in which he could not fail to awaken the full commiseration and sympathy of both judge and jury.
Mr. Skimpin bowed, to intimate that he was.
‘Anybody with you, Brother Snubbin?’ inquired the court.
‘You have heard from my learned friend, gentlemen,’ continued Serjeant Buzfuz, well knowing that, from the learned friend alluded to, the gentlemen of the jury had heard just nothing at all--‘you have heard from my learned friend, gentlemen, that this is an action for a breach of promise of marriage, in which the damages are laid at £1,500.
With this little boy, the only pledge of her departed exciseman, Mrs. Bardell shrank from the world, and courted the retirement and tranquillity of Goswell Street; and here she placed in her front parlour window a written placard, bearing this inscription--“Apartments furnished for a single gentleman.
‘I say systematic villainy, gentlemen,’ said Serjeant Buzfuz, looking through Mr. Pickwick, and talking _at_ him; ‘and when I say systematic villainy, let me tell the defendant Pickwick, if he be in court, as I am informed he is, that it would have been more decent in him, more becoming, in better judgment, and in better taste, if he had stopped away.
Let me tell him, gentlemen, that any gestures of dissent or disapprobation in which he may indulge in this court will not go down with you; that you will know how to value and how to appreciate them; and let me tell him further, as my Lord will tell you, gentlemen, that a counsel, in the discharge of his duty to his client, is neither to be intimidated nor bullied, nor put down; and that any attempt to do either the one or the other, or the first, or the last, will recoil on the head of the attempter, be he plaintiff or be he defendant, be his name Pickwick, or Noakes, or Stoakes, or Stiles, or Brown, or Thompson.’ This little divergence from the subject in hand, had, of course, the intended effect of turning all eyes to Mr. Pickwick.
I shall show you that, on many occasions, he gave halfpence, and on some occasions even sixpences, to her little boy; and I shall prove to you, by a witness whose testimony it will be impossible for my learned friend to weaken or controvert, that on one occasion he patted the boy on the head, and, after inquiring whether he had won any “_alley tors_” or “_commoneys_” lately (both of which I understand to be a particular species of marbles much prized by the youth of this town), made use of this remarkable expression, “How should you like to have another father?” I shall prove to you, gentlemen, that about a year ago, Pickwick suddenly began to absent himself from home, during long intervals, as if with the intention of gradually breaking off from my client; but I shall show you also, that his resolution was not at that time sufficiently strong, or that his better feelings conquered, if better feelings he has, or that the charms and accomplishments of my client prevailed against his unmanly intentions, by proving to you, that on one occasion, when he returned from the country, he distinctly and in terms, offered her marriage: previously, however, taking special care that there would be no witness to their solemn contract; and I am in a situation to prove to you, on the testimony of three of his own friends--most unwilling witnesses, gentlemen--most unwilling witnesses--that on that morning he was discovered by them holding the plaintiff in his arms, and soothing her agitation by his caresses and endearments.’ A visible impression was produced upon the auditors by this part of the learned Serjeant’s address.
They are not open, fervent, eloquent epistles, breathing nothing but the language of affectionate attachment.
‘But enough of this, gentlemen,’ said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, ‘it is difficult to smile with an aching heart; it is ill jesting when our deepest sympathies are awakened.
Mrs. Cluppins having once broken the ice, thought it a favourable opportunity for entering into a short dissertation on her own domestic affairs; so she straightway proceeded to inform the court that she was the mother of eight children at that present speaking, and that she entertained confident expectations of presenting Mr. Cluppins with a ninth, somewhere about that day six months.
At this interesting point, the little judge interposed most irascibly; and the effect of the interposition was, that both the worthy lady and Mrs. Sanders were politely taken out of court, under the escort of Mr. Jackson, without further parley.
Now, have the goodness to tell the gentlemen of the jury what you mean by that, Mr. Winkle.’ ‘I mean that I am not intimate with her, but I have seen her when I went to call on Mr. Pickwick, in Goswell Street.’ ‘How often have you seen her, Sir?’ ‘How often?’ ‘Yes, Mr. Winkle, how often?
Had you ever any reason to suppose or believe that he was about to be married?’ ‘Oh, no; certainly not;’ replied Mr. Winkle with so much eagerness, that Mr. Phunky ought to have got him out of the box with all possible dispatch.
‘Has his behaviour, when females have been in the case, always been that of a man, who, having attained a pretty advanced period of life, content with his own occupations and amusements, treats them only as a father might his daughters?’ ‘Not the least doubt of it,’ replied Mr. Winkle, in the fulness of his heart.
‘Describe the occasion to which you refer.’ ‘My Lord,’ said Mr. Winkle, trembling with anxiety, ‘I--I’d rather not.’ ‘Perhaps so,’ said the little judge; ‘but you must.’ Amid the profound silence of the whole court, Mr. Winkle faltered out, that the trifling circumstance of suspicion was Mr. Pickwick’s being found in a lady’s sleeping-apartment at midnight; which had terminated, he believed, in the breaking off of the projected marriage of the lady in question, and had led, he knew, to the whole party being forcibly carried before George Nupkins, Esq., magistrate and justice of the peace, for the borough of Ipswich!
Had always said and believed that Pickwick would marry Mrs. Bardell; knew that Mrs. Bardell’s being engaged to Pickwick was the current topic of conversation in the neighbourhood, after the fainting in July; had been told it herself by Mrs. Mudberry which kept a mangle, and Mrs. Bunkin which clear-starched, but did not see either Mrs. Mudberry or Mrs. Bunkin in court.
Did not know that Mrs. Bardell was at that time keeping company with the baker, but did know that the baker was then a single man and is now married.
Couldn’t swear that Mrs. Bardell was not very fond of the baker, but should think that the baker was not very fond of Mrs. Bardell, or he wouldn’t have married somebody else.
Heard Pickwick ask the boy the question about the marbles, but upon her oath did not know the difference between an ‘alley tor’ and a ‘commoney.’ By the _court_.--During the period of her keeping company with Mr. Sanders, had received love letters, like other ladies.
Perhaps if he had been as fond of chops and tomato sauce, he might have called her that, as a term of affection.
Put it down a “we,” my Lord, put it down a “we.”’ Who is that, who dares address the court?’ said the little judge, looking up.
‘No, I don’t, my Lord,’ replied Sam, staring right up into the lantern at the roof of the court.
I will not trouble the court by asking him any more questions.
If they were satisfied that a breach of promise of marriage had been committed they would find for the plaintiff with such damages as they thought proper; and if, on the other hand, it appeared to them that no promise of marriage had ever been given, they would find for the defendant with no damages at all.
Mr. Pickwick put on his spectacles, and gazed at the foreman with an agitated countenance and a quickly-beating heart.
‘Do you find for the plaintiff, gentlemen, or for the defendant?’ For the plaintiff.’ ‘With what damages, gentlemen?’ ‘Seven hundred and fifty pounds.’ Mr. Pickwick took off his spectacles, carefully wiped the glasses, folded them into their case, and put them in his pocket; then, having drawn on his gloves with great nicety, and stared at the foreman all the while, he mechanically followed Mr. Perker and the blue bag out of court.
They stopped in a side room while Perker paid the court fees; and here, Mr. Pickwick was joined by his friends.
I shall employ myself as usual, until the opposite party have the power of issuing a legal process of execution against me; and if they are vile enough to avail themselves of it, and to arrest my person, I shall yield myself up with perfect cheerfulness and content of heart.
I courted her under singular circumstances.
I saw her; I loved her; I proposed; she refused me.--“You love another?”--“Spare my blushes.”--“I know him.”--“You do.”--“Very good; if he remains here, I’ll skin him.”’ ‘Lord bless me!’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick involuntarily.
I married her.
I hope that ‘ere trial hasn’t broke his spirit, but it looks bad, wery bad.’ Mr. Weller shook his head gravely; and it is worthy of remark, as an illustration of the manner in which he took this circumstance to heart, that he did not speak another word until the coach reached the Kensington turnpike.
I said I thought I wasn’t engaged, ma.’ ‘You’re a sweet pet, my love,’ replied Mrs.
Colonel Wugsby kissed her eldest daughter most affectionately, and frowning in a warning manner upon the other, sorted her cards.
Then, at the end of every hand, Miss Bolo would inquire with a dismal countenance and reproachful sigh, why Mr. Pickwick had not returned that diamond, or led the club, or roughed the spade, or finessed the heart, or led through the honour, or brought out the ace, or played up to the king, or some such thing; and in reply to all these grave charges, Mr. Pickwick would be wholly unable to plead any justification whatever, having by this time forgotten all about the game.
Besides all this, there was a great deal of distracting conversation near the table, between Angelo Bantam and the two Misses Matinter, who, being single and singular, paid great court to the Master of the Ceremonies, in the hope of getting a stray partner now and then.
‘For many hundred years before that time, there had been handed down, from age to age, an old legend, that the illustrious prince being afflicted with leprosy, on his return from reaping a rich harvest of knowledge in Athens, shunned the court of his royal father, and consorted moodily with husbandman and pigs.
Hastening to his father’s court, he paid his best respects, and returning quickly hither, founded this city and its famous baths.
‘He sought the pig with all the ardour of their early friendship--but, alas!
‘When King Lud saw the prince his son, and found he had grown up such a fine young man, he perceived what a grand thing it would be to have him married without delay, so that his children might be the means of perpetuating the glorious race of Lud, down to the very latest ages of the world.
With this view, he sent a special embassy, composed of great noblemen who had nothing particular to do, and wanted lucrative employment, to a neighbouring king, and demanded his fair daughter in marriage for his son; stating at the same time that he was anxious to be on the most affectionate terms with his brother and friend, but that if they couldn’t agree in arranging this marriage, he should be under the unpleasant necessity of invading his kingdom and putting his eyes out.
To this, the other king (who was the weaker of the two) replied that he was very much obliged to his friend and brother for all his goodness and magnanimity, and that his daughter was quite ready to be married, whenever Prince Bladud liked to come and fetch her.
It was upon this occasion that King Lud, seated on the top of his throne in full council, rose, in the exuberance of his feelings, and commanded the lord chief justice to order in the richest wines and the court minstrels--an act of graciousness which has been, through the ignorance of traditionary historians, attributed to King Cole, in those celebrated lines in which his Majesty is represented as Calling for his pipe, and calling for his pot, And calling for his fiddlers three.
The truth was, that the prince, forgetting the undoubted right of the minister for foreign affairs to fall in love on his behalf, had, contrary to every precedent of policy and diplomacy, already fallen in love on his own account, and privately contracted himself unto the fair daughter of a noble Athenian.
If the prince had lived in later days, he might at once have married the object of his father’s choice, and then set himself seriously to work, to relieve himself of the burden which rested heavily upon him.
He might have endeavoured to break her heart by a systematic course of insult and neglect; or, if the spirit of her sex, and a proud consciousness of her many wrongs had upheld her under this ill-treatment, he might have sought to take her life, and so get rid of her effectually.
‘When Prince Bladud had been shut up in the lofty turret for the greater part of a year, with no better prospect before his bodily eyes than a stone wall, or before his mental vision than prolonged imprisonment, he naturally began to ruminate on a plan of escape, which, after months of preparation, he managed to accomplish; considerately leaving his dinner- knife in the heart of his jailer, lest the poor fellow (who had a family) should be considered privy to his flight, and punished accordingly by the infuriated king.
‘“Why,” replied the peasant, “the foreign lady that our prince wished to wed, is married to a foreign noble of her own country, and the king proclaims the fact, and a great public festival besides; for now, of course, Prince Bladud will come back and marry the lady his father chose, who they say is as beautiful as the noonday sun.
Would that these grateful tears with which I now mourn hope misplaced, and love despised, might flow in peace for ever!” ‘The wish was heard.
I think it’s wery pretty.’ At this the man in blue smiled, as if it were a compliment he was well used to; but looked approvingly on Sam at the same time, and said he hoped he should be better acquainted with him, for without any flattery at all he seemed to have the makings of a very nice fellow about him, and to be just the man after his own heart.
I might keep up with a young ‘ooman o’ large property as hadn’t a title, if she made wery fierce love to me.
Mr. Whiffers’s address was responded to, with a shout of admiration, and the health of the interesting martyr was drunk in a most enthusiastic manner; for this, the martyr returned thanks, and proposed their visitor, Mr. Weller--a gentleman whom he had not the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with, but who was the friend of Mr. John Smauker, which was a sufficient letter of recommendation to any society of gentlemen whatever, or wherever.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>You have my orders.’ Sam gave a nod of intelligence, and withdrawing his head from the door, set forth on his pilgrimage with a light heart.
Bless your heart, old fellow, it’s better than all the advertising in the world.
When they had enjoyed the joke to their heart’s content, the discourse changed to topics in which Mr. Winkle was more immediately interested.
The suspected prior attachment rankled in his heart.
But he had no opportunity of pondering over his love just then, for Bob Sawyer’s return was the immediate precursor of the arrival of a meat-pie from the baker’s, of which that gentleman insisted on his staying to partake.
Resisting all entreaties to stay till he came back, and finding it quite impossible to engage Mr. Ben Allen in any intelligible conversation on the subject nearest his heart, or indeed on any other, Mr. Winkle took his departure, and returned to the Bush.
‘I thought it better to come myself,’ said Mr. Pickwick, addressing Mr. Winkle, as Sam disencumbered him of his great-coat and travelling-shawl, ‘to ascertain, before I gave my consent to Sam’s employment in this matter, that you are quite in earnest and serious, with respect to this young lady.’ ‘Serious, from my heart--from my soul!’ returned Mr. Winkle, with great energy.
‘That’s wery odd--that is,’ said Sam, ‘for you look so uncommon cheerful, and seem altogether so lively, that it does vun’s heart good to see you.’ The surly groom looked surlier still at this, but not sufficiently so to produce any effect upon Sam, who immediately inquired, with a countenance of great anxiety, whether his master’s name was not Walker.
Tell ‘em not to vait dinner for me, and say they needn’t mind puttin’ any by, for it’ll be cold afore I come in.’ In reply to this, the groom waxing very wroth, muttered a desire to damage somebody’s person; but disappeared without carrying it into execution, slamming the door angrily after him, and wholly unheeding Sam’s affectionate request, that he would leave him a lock of his hair before he went.
We merely know that after a short pause Mary said, ‘Lor, do adun, Mr. Weller!’ and that his hat had fallen off a few moments before--from both of which tokens we should be disposed to infer that one kiss, or more, had passed between the parties.
‘But Mary, my dear’--here Sam’s manner grew extremely affectionate--‘Mary, my dear, I’ve got another affair in hand as is wery pressin’.
‘Oh, yes, I remember him.’ ‘Well,’ said Sam, ‘he’s in a horrid state o’ love; reg’larly comfoozled, and done over vith it.’ ‘Lor!’ interposed Mary.
Mr. Weller was so deeply overcome on receiving this intelligence that he found it absolutely necessary to cling to his fair informant for support; and divers little love passages had passed between them, before he was sufficiently collected to return to the subject.
We do not know, to a nicety, how many pieces of carpet were folded in this instance, but we can venture to state that as many pieces as there were, so many times did Sam kiss the pretty housemaid.
‘It may seem wery strange talkin’ to me about these here affairs, miss,’ said Sam, with great vehemence; ‘but all I can say is, that I’m not only ready but villin’ to do anythin’ as’ll make matters agreeable; and if chuckin’ either o’ them sawboneses out o’ winder ‘ull do it, I’m the man.’ As Sam Weller said this, he tucked up his wristbands, at the imminent hazard of falling off the wall in so doing, to intimate his readiness to set to work immediately.
‘Bless my heart!’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, turning round again.
‘I merely wished you to know, my dear, that I should not have allowed my young friend to see you in this clandestine way, if the situation in which you are placed had left him any alternative; and, lest the impropriety of this step should cause you any uneasiness, my love, it may be a satisfaction to you, to know that I am present.
He was up again in an instant however; and bidding Mr. Winkle make haste and get the interview over, ran out into the lane to keep watch, with all the courage and ardour of youth.
Blessed if I don’t think his heart must ha’ been born five-and-twenty year arter his body, at least!’ Mr. Winkle stayed not to hear the encomium upon his friend.
Into one pocket of this greatcoat, he thrust his left hand the moment he dismounted, while from the other he drew forth, with his right, a very bright and glaring silk handkerchief, with which he whisked a speck or two of dust from his boots, and then, crumpling it in his hand, swaggered up the court.
‘Here, Smouch!’ ‘Well, wot’s amiss here?’ growled the man in the brown coat, who had been gradually sneaking up the court during this short dialogue.
In the adjoining room, some solitary tenant might be seen poring, by the light of a feeble tallow candle, over a bundle of soiled and tattered papers, yellow with dust and dropping to pieces from age, writing, for the hundredth time, some lengthened statement of his grievances, for the perusal of some great man whose eyes it would never reach, or whose heart it would never touch.
There is no disguising the fact that Mr. Pickwick felt very low-spirited and uncomfortable--not for lack of society, for the prison was very full, and a bottle of wine would at once have purchased the utmost good- fellowship of a few choice spirits, without any more formal ceremony of introduction; but he was alone in the coarse, vulgar crowd, and felt the depression of spirits and sinking of heart, naturally consequent on the reflection that he was cooped and caged up, without a prospect of liberation.
Mr. Pickwick’s heart was really too full to bear it, and he went upstairs to bed.
‘Why, bless the gentleman’s honest heart and soul!’ said the Zephyr, turning round and affecting the extremity of surprise; ‘the gentleman is awake.
‘Are you going through the court, sir?’ inquired Mr. Smangle.
‘Through the court--Portugal Street--the Court for Relief of--you know.’ ‘Oh, no,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
An excellent understanding having been by these means promoted, Mr. Smangle proceeded to entertain his hearers with a relation of divers romantic adventures in which he had been from time to time engaged, involving various interesting anecdotes of a thoroughbred horse, and a magnificent Jewess, both of surpassing beauty, and much coveted by the nobility and gentry of these kingdoms.
‘Has anything new occurred since last night?’ ‘Nothin’ partickler, sir,’ replied Sam, glancing at Mr. Smangle’s whiskers; ‘the late prewailance of a close and confined atmosphere has been rayther favourable to the growth of veeds, of an alarmin’ and sangvinary natur; but vith that ‘ere exception things is quiet enough.’ ‘I shall get up,’ said Mr. Pickwick; ‘give me some clean things.’ Whatever hostile intentions Mr. Smangle might have entertained, his thoughts were speedily diverted by the unpacking of the portmanteau; the contents of which appeared to impress him at once with a most favourable opinion, not only of Mr. Pickwick, but of Sam also, who, he took an early opportunity of declaring in a tone of voice loud enough for that eccentric personage to overhear, was a regular thoroughbred original, and consequently the very man after his own heart.
As to Mr. Pickwick, the affection he conceived for him knew no limits.
‘Can’t step far--no danger of overwalking yourself here--spike park--grounds pretty--romantic, but not extensive--open for public inspection--family always in town-- housekeeper desperately careful--very.’ ‘You have forgotten your coat,’ said Mr. Pickwick, as they walked out to the staircase, and closed the door after them.
It was something from Mr. Pickwick’s waistcoat pocket, which chinked as it was given into Job’s hand, and the giving of which, somehow or other imparted a sparkle to the eye, and a swelling to the heart, of our excellent old friend, as he hurried away.
It is, and has been, time out of mind, the remarkable fate of this court to be, somehow or other, held and understood, by the general consent of all the destitute shabby-genteel people in London, as their common resort, and place of daily refuge.
When it is heavy, rainy weather, they all come in, wet through; and at such times the vapours of the court are like those of a fungus-pit.
The intelligence was no sooner received than the whole party hurried across the street, and began to fight their way into court--a preparatory ceremony, which has been calculated to occupy, in ordinary cases, from twenty-five minutes to thirty.
‘You’re a dutiful and affectionate little boy, you are, ain’t you,’ said Mr. Weller, ‘to come a-bonnetin’ your father in his old age?’ ‘How should I know who you wos?’ responded the son.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>‘And the man as puts me in, ‘ull never let me out till you go yourself.’ ‘Bless my heart and soul!’ ejaculated Mr. Pickwick.
‘It ain’t o’ no use, sir,’ said Sam, again and again; ‘he’s a malicious, bad-disposed, vorldly-minded, spiteful, windictive creetur, with a hard heart as there ain’t no soft’nin’, as the wirtuous clergyman remarked of the old gen’l’m’n with the dropsy, ven he said, that upon the whole he thought he’d rayther leave his property to his vife than build a chapel vith it.’ ‘But consider, Sam,’ Mr. Pickwick remonstrated, ‘the sum is so small that it can very easily be paid; and having made up my mind that you shall stop with me, you should recollect how much more useful you would be, if you could go outside the walls.’ Wery much obliged to you, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller gravely; ‘but I’d rayther not.’ ‘Rather not do what, Sam?’ ‘Wy, I’d rayther not let myself down to ask a favour o’ this here unremorseful enemy.’ ‘But it is no favour asking him to take his money, Sam,’ reasoned Mr. Pickwick.
Wy don’t you give in, and tell the Chancellorship that you’re wery sorry for makin’ his court contemptible, and you won’t do so no more?’ The cobbler put his pipe in the corner of his mouth, while he smiled, and then brought it back to its old place again; but said nothing.
‘Just this,’ replied the cobbler; ‘an old gentleman that I worked for, down in the country, and a humble relation of whose I married--she’s dead, God bless her, and thank Him for it!--was seized with a fit and went off.’ ‘Where?’ inquired Sam, who was growing sleepy after the numerous events of the day.
‘One of which,’ continued the cobbler, ‘he left to me, ‘cause I married his relation, you see.’ ‘Wery good,’ murmured Sam.
I appealed; the case come on before three or four very sleepy gentlemen, who had heard it all before in the other court, where they’re lawyers without work; the only difference being, that, there, they’re called doctors, and in the other place delegates, if you understand that; and they very dutifully confirmed the decision of the old gentleman below.
If I makes any guess about it,’ added Sam, looking at Mr. Winkle, ‘I haven’t got any right to say what it is, ‘fear it should be a wrong ‘un.’ ‘I have no right to make any further inquiry into the private affairs of a friend, however intimate a friend,’ said Mr. Pickwick, after a short silence; ‘at present let me merely say, that I do not understand this at all.
My heart broke when my child died, and I could not even kiss him in his little coffin.
Here, the first object that met his eyes was his beloved father sitting on a bottom stair, with his hat in his hand, shouting out ‘Weller!’ in his very loudest tone, at half-minute intervals.
Is it the case, mum?’ The worthy lady looked at Mr. Stiggins for a reply; that gentleman, with many rollings of the eye, clenched his throat with his right hand, and mimicked the act of swallowing, to intimate that he was athirst.
Warm, my dear young friend, with three lumps of sugar to the tumbler.’ ‘Wery sorry to say, sir,’ said Sam, ‘that they don’t allow that particular wanity to be sold in this here establishment.’ ‘Oh, the hardness of heart of these inveterate men!’ ejaculated Mr. Stiggins.
‘Pend upon it, Sammy, it’s a constitootional infirmity.’ Mr. Weller delivered this scientific opinion with many confirmatory frowns and nods; which, Mrs. Weller remarking, and concluding that they bore some disparaging reference either to herself or to Mr. Stiggins, or to both, was on the point of becoming infinitely worse, when Mr. Stiggins, getting on his legs as well as he could, proceeded to deliver an edifying discourse for the benefit of the company, but more especially of Mr. Samuel, whom he adjured in moving terms to be upon his guard in that sink of iniquity into which he was cast; to abstain from all hypocrisy and pride of heart; and to take in all things exact pattern and copy by him (Stiggins), in which case he might calculate on arriving, sooner or later at the comfortable conclusion, that, like him, he was a most estimable and blameless character, and that all his acquaintances and friends were hopelessly abandoned and profligate wretches.
‘How do you find yourself arter it, my love?’ ‘Scoffer!’ exclaimed Mrs. Weller.
‘Bless your heart, no, Sir,’ replied Job; ‘a whistling-shop, Sir, is where they sell spirits.’ Mr. Job Trotter briefly explained here, that all persons, being prohibited under heavy penalties from conveying spirits into debtors’ prisons, and such commodities being highly prized by the ladies and gentlemen confined therein, it had occurred to some speculative turnkey to connive, for certain lucrative considerations, at two or three prisoners retailing the favourite article of gin, for their own profit and advantage.
‘My head aches with these scenes, and my heart too.
‘Who else is a-goin’, lovey?’ said Mrs. Cluppins, in an insinuating manner.
‘Oh, indeed!’ said Mrs. Rogers graciously; for she was the lodger, and her servant was in waiting, so she was more gracious than intimate, in right of her position.
‘Indeed, to tell you the truth, I said, as we was a-coming along in the cabrioily--’ At the recapitulation of the word which awakened so many painful recollections, Mrs. Raddle applied her handkerchief to her eyes again, and uttered a half-suppressed scream; so that Mrs. Bardell frowned upon Mr. Raddle, to intimate that he had better not say anything more, and desired Mrs. Rogers’s servant, with an air, to ‘put the wine on.’ This was the signal for displaying the hidden treasures of the closet, which comprised sundry plates of oranges and biscuits, and a bottle of old crusted port--that at one-and-nine--with another of the celebrated East India sherry at fourteen-pence, which were all produced in honour of the lodger, and afforded unlimited satisfaction to everybody.
Of course Mrs. Bardell burst into tears, and requested to be led from the table instantly; upon which the affectionate child began to cry too, most dismally.
‘Would anybody believe, ma’am,’ exclaimed Mrs. Raddle, turning fiercely to the first-floor lodger, ‘that a woman could be married to such a unmanly creetur, which can tamper with a woman’s feelings as he does, every hour in the day, ma’am?’ ‘My dear,’ remonstrated Mr. Raddle, ‘I didn’t mean anything, my dear.’ ‘You didn’t mean!’ repeated Mrs. Raddle, with great scorn and contempt.
After this, there was a great hoisting up of Master Bardell, who was rather a large size for hugging, into his mother’s arms, in which operation he got his boots in the tea-board, and occasioned some confusion among the cups and saucers.
But that description of fainting fits, which is contagious among ladies, seldom lasts long; so when he had been well kissed, and a little cried over, Mrs. Bardell recovered, set him down again, wondering how she could have been so foolish, and poured out some more tea.
Surely Mr. Pickwick can’t have paid the damages.’ ‘Or hoffered marriage!’ said Mrs. Cluppins.
‘What do you mean?’ said Mrs. Bardell, with a palpitating heart.
Notwithstanding all the expedition he had used, however, the gate had been closed a good half-hour when he reached it, and by the time he had discovered Mr. Perker’s laundress, who lived with a married daughter, who had bestowed her hand upon a non-resident waiter, who occupied the one-pair of some number in some street closely adjoining to some brewery somewhere behind Gray’s Inn Lane, it was within fifteen minutes of closing the prison for the night.
Can you hesitate to avail yourself of it, when it restores you to your friends, your old pursuits, your health and amusements; when it liberates your faithful and attached servant, whom you otherwise doom to imprisonment for the whole of your life; and above all, when it enables you to take the very magnanimous revenge--which I know, my dear sir, is one after your own heart--of releasing this woman from a scene of misery and debauchery, to which no man should ever be consigned, if I had my will, but the infliction of which on any woman, is even more frightful and barbarous.
‘Can you forgive my imprudence?’ Mr. Pickwick returned no verbal response to this appeal; but he took off his spectacles in great haste, and seizing both the young lady’s hands in his, kissed her a great number of times--perhaps a greater number than was absolutely necessary--and then, still retaining one of her hands, told Mr. Winkle he was an audacious young dog, and bade him get up.
‘If I were not a married man myself, I should be disposed to envy you, you dog.’ Thus expressing himself, the little lawyer gave Mr. Winkle a poke in the chest, which that gentleman reciprocated; after which they both laughed very loudly, but not so loudly as Mr. Samuel Weller, who had just relieved his feelings by kissing the pretty housemaid under cover of the cupboard door.
‘Now then; how long have you been married, eh?’ Arabella looked bashfully at her lord and master, who replied, ‘Only three days.’ ‘Only three days, eh?’ said Mr. Pickwick.
‘You forget, my love,’ said Mr. Pickwick gently, ‘you forget that I am a prisoner.’ ‘No, indeed I do not, my dear Sir,’ replied Arabella.
Taking advantage of these symptoms of indecision, Mr. Perker (to whom, it appeared, the young couple had driven straight that morning) urged with legal point and shrewdness that Mr. Winkle, senior, was still unacquainted with the important rise in life’s flight of steps which his son had taken; that the future expectations of the said son depended entirely upon the said Winkle, senior, continuing to regard him with undiminished feelings of affection and attachment, which it was very unlikely he would, if this great event were long kept a secret from him; that Mr. Pickwick, repairing to Bristol to seek Mr. Allen, might, with equal reason, repair to Birmingham to seek Mr. Winkle, senior; lastly, that Mr. Winkle, senior, had good right and title to consider Mr. Pickwick as in some degree the guardian and adviser of his son, and that it consequently behoved that gentleman, and was indeed due to his personal character, to acquaint the aforesaid Winkle, senior, personally, and by word of mouth, with the whole circumstances of the case, and with the share he had taken in the transaction.
And, at last, Mr. Pickwick, fairly argued and remonstrated out of all his resolutions, and being in imminent danger of being argued and remonstrated out of his wits, caught Arabella in his arms, and declaring that she was a very amiable creature, and that he didn’t know how it was, but he had always been very fond of her from the first, said he could never find it in his heart to stand in the way of young people’s happiness, and they might do with him as they pleased.
‘She has it when she comes of age, or marries.
He paused for a few seconds, and added in a voice broken by emotion, ‘You have loved her from a child, my friend.
You loved her when we were boys at school together, and, even then, she was wayward and slighted your young feelings.
Do you recollect, with all the eagerness of a child’s love, one day pressing upon her acceptance, two small caraway-seed biscuits and one sweet apple, neatly folded into a circular parcel with the leaf of a copy-book?’ ‘I do,’ replied Bob Sawyer.
Immediately on the old lady’s entering the shop, Mr. Benjamin Allen and Mr. Bob Sawyer, who had been putting the spirits-and-water out of sight, and upsetting nauseous drugs to take off the smell of the tobacco smoke, issued hastily forth in a transport of pleasure and affection.
The head is in fault.’ ‘I should be very sorry to think it was the heart,’ said the old lady, with a slight groan.
‘I have rendered no assistance in this matter, beyond being present at one interview between the young people which I could not prevent, and from which I conceived my presence would remove any slight colouring of impropriety that it might otherwise have had; this is the whole share I have had in the transaction, and I had no suspicion that an immediate marriage was even contemplated.
At length, when this determination had been announced half a hundred times, the old lady suddenly bridling up and looking very majestic, wished to know what she had done that no respect was to be paid to her years or station, and that she should be obliged to beg and pray, in that way, of her own nephew, whom she remembered about five-and-twenty years before he was born, and whom she had known, personally, when he hadn’t a tooth in his head; to say nothing of her presence on the first occasion of his having his hair cut, and assistance at numerous other times and ceremonies during his babyhood, of sufficient importance to found a claim upon his affection, obedience, and sympathies, for ever.
‘I have always considered it a great point in my uncle’s character, gentlemen, that he was the intimate friend and companion of Tom Smart, of the great house of Bilson and Slum, Cateaton Street, City.
However, there he lay, and I have heard my uncle say, many a time, that the man said who picked him up that he was smiling as merrily as if he had tumbled out for a treat, and that after they had bled him, the first faint glimmerings of returning animation, were his jumping up in bed, bursting out into a loud laugh, kissing the young woman who held the basin, and demanding a mutton chop and a pickled walnut.
‘I am particular in describing how my uncle walked up the middle of the street, with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, gentlemen, because, as he often used to say (and with great reason too) there is nothing at all extraordinary in this story, unless you distinctly understand at the beginning, that he was not by any means of a marvellous or romantic turn.
‘Gentlemen, my uncle walked on with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, taking the middle of the street to himself, and singing, now a verse of a love song, and then a verse of a drinking one, and when he was tired of both, whistling melodiously, until he reached the North Bridge, which, at this point, connects the old and new towns of Edinburgh.
The merchant, the lover, the wife, the widow, the mother, the school-boy, the very child who tottered to the door at the postman’s knock--how had they all looked forward to the arrival of the old coach.
‘At this very moment, the gentleman in sky-blue turning round, and seeing the young lady with her face uncovered, vented an exclamation of rage and jealousy, and, turning his weapon against her beautiful bosom, pointed a thrust at her heart, which caused my uncle to utter a cry of apprehension that made the building ring.
“That wretch would have married me by violence in another hour.” ‘“Confound his impudence!” said my uncle, bestowing a very contemptuous look on the dying heir of Filletoville.
‘Gentlemen, I hope I do no injustice to my uncle’s memory, when I express my opinion, that although he was a bachelor, he had held some ladies in his arms before this time; I believe, indeed, that he had rather a habit of kissing barmaids; and I know, that in one or two instances, he had been seen by credible witnesses, to hug a landlady in a very perceptible manner.
‘“Because your mouth looks so beautiful when you speak,” rejoined my uncle, “that I’m afraid I shall be rude enough to kiss it.” ‘The young lady put up her hand as if to caution my uncle not to do so, and said--No, she didn’t say anything--she smiled.
When you are looking at a pair of the most delicious lips in the world, and see them gently break into a roguish smile--if you are very near them, and nobody else by--you cannot better testify your admiration of their beautiful form and colour than by kissing them at once.
‘“Stay, love,” cried the young lady.
‘“Will you never love any one but me--never marry any one beside?” said the young lady.
‘My uncle swore a great oath that he never would marry anybody else, and the young lady drew in her head, and pulled up the window.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As they rattled through the narrow thoroughfares leading to the heart of the turmoil, the sights and sounds of earnest occupation struck more forcibly on the senses.
‘Not the slightest, my love,’ said Bob Sawyer, playfully stretching forth his arms, and skipping from side to side, as if to prevent the young lady’s leaving the room.
Mr. Pickwick eyed him intently as he turned from the bottom line of the first page to the top line of the second, and from the bottom of the second to the top of the third, and from the bottom of the third to the top of the fourth; but not the slightest alteration of countenance afforded a clue to the feelings with which he received the announcement of his son’s marriage, which Mr. Pickwick knew was in the very first half-dozen lines.
No assurance to convey to him, through me, of the continuance of your affection and protection?
Does not even his obtuseness perceive that this amiable and touching desire to carry out the wishes of the constituent body, must for ever endear him to the hearts and souls of such of his fellow townsmen as are not worse than swine; or, in other words, who are not as debased as our contemporary himself?
We boldly state, now that we are goaded to the disclosure, and we throw ourselves on the country and its constables for protection--we boldly state that secret preparations are at this moment in progress for a Buff ball; which is to be held in a Buff town, in the very heart and centre of a Buff population; which is to be conducted by a Buff master of the ceremonies; which is to be attended by four ultra Buff members of Parliament, and the admission to which, is to be by Buff tickets!
‘There’s a letter been waiting here for you four days; you hadn’t gone away, half an hour, when it came; and more than that, it’s got “immediate,” on the outside.’ ‘Vere is it, my love?’ inquired Sam.
‘There, take it; it’s more than you deserve.’ With these words, after many pretty little coquettish doubts and fears, and wishes that she might not have lost it, Mary produced the letter from behind the nicest little muslin tucker possible, and handed it to Sam, who thereupon kissed it with much gallantry and devotion.
Sam refreshed himself with a kiss, and read as follows:-- ‘MARKIS GRAN ‘By DORKEN ‘Wensdy.
‘Hows’ever,’ said Sam, putting the letter in his pocket with a gentle sigh, ‘it wos to be--and wos, as the old lady said arter she’d married the footman.
I begin to see now,” she says, “ven it’s too late, that if a married ‘ooman vishes to be religious, she should begin vith dischargin’ her dooties at home, and makin’ them as is about her cheerful and happy, and that vile she goes to church, or chapel, or wot not, at all proper times, she should be wery careful not to con-wert this sort o’ thing into a excuse for idleness or self-indulgence.
I have done this,” she says, “and I’ve vasted time and substance on them as has done it more than me; but I hope ven I’m gone, Veller, that you’ll think on me as I wos afore I know’d them people, and as I raly wos by natur.” ‘“Susan,” says I--I wos took up wery short by this, Samivel; I von’t deny it, my boy--“Susan,” I says, “you’ve been a wery good vife to me, altogether; don’t say nothin’ at all about it; keep a good heart, my dear; and you’ll live to see me punch that ‘ere Stiggins’s head yet.” She smiled at this, Samivel,’ said the old gentleman, stifling a sigh with his pipe, ‘but she died arter all!’ ‘Vell,’ said Sam, venturing to offer a little homely consolation, after the lapse of three or four minutes, consumed by the old gentleman in slowly shaking his head from side to side, and solemnly smoking, ‘vell, gov’nor, ve must all come to it, one day or another.’ ‘So we must, Sammy,’ said Mr. Weller the elder.
‘You see, Mr. Samuel,’ said the buxom female, ‘as I was telling him yesterday, he will feel lonely, he can’t expect but what he should, sir, but he should keep up a good heart, because, dear me, I’m sure we all pity his loss, and are ready to do anything for him; and there’s no situation in life so bad, Mr. Samuel, that it can’t be mended.
‘Samivel, show the lady out, and shut the door after her.’ This hint was not lost upon the buxom female; for she at once left the room, and slammed the door behind her, upon which Mr. Weller, senior, falling back in his chair in a violent perspiration, said-- ‘Sammy, if I wos to stop here alone vun week--only vun week, my boy-- that ‘ere ‘ooman ‘ud marry me by force and wiolence afore it was over.’ ‘Wot!
‘’Cos a coachman may do vithout suspicion wot other men may not; ‘cos a coachman may be on the wery amicablest terms with eighty mile o’ females, and yet nobody think that he ever means to marry any vun among ‘em.
‘Wery good, Samivel, a dispensation if you like it better,’ returned Mr. Weller; ‘I call it a dispensary, and it’s always writ up so, at the places vere they gives you physic for nothin’ in your own bottles; that’s all.’ With these words, Mr. Weller refilled and relighted his pipe, and once more summoning up a meditative expression of countenance, continued as follows-- ‘Therefore, my boy, as I do not see the adwisability o’ stoppin here to be married vether I vant to or not, and as at the same time I do not vish to separate myself from them interestin’ members o’ society altogether, I have come to the determination o’ driving the Safety, and puttin’ up vunce more at the Bell Savage, vich is my nat’ral born element, Sammy.’ ‘And wot’s to become o’ the bis’ness?’ inquired Sam.
‘For the man of wrath, too!’ added Mr. Stiggins; ‘it makes a vessel’s heart bleed!’ Mr. Weller was overheard by his son to murmur something relative to making a vessel’s nose bleed; but Mr. Stiggins heard him not.
It was impossible to foresee that the old gentleman would be so strongly prepossessed against his son’s marriage, you know.
‘In that case, my love,’ rejoined Mr. Pickwick, ‘I will venture to prophesy that he will find some other friend who will not be backward in helping him to start in the world.’ The significance of this reply was not so well disguised by Mr. Pickwick but that Arabella understood it.
So, throwing her arms round his neck, and kissing him affectionately, she sobbed louder than before.
He emigrated to America, Sir, in consequence of being too much sought after here, to be comfortable; and has never been heard of since.’ ‘That accounts for my not having received the “page from the romance of real life,” which he promised me one morning when he appeared to be contemplating suicide on Rochester Bridge, I suppose,’ said Mr. Pickwick, smiling.
On intimate terms he would have been even a more dangerous acquaintance than--’ Job looked at Jingle, hesitated, and finally added, ‘than--than-myself even.’ ‘A hopeful family yours, Mr. Trotter,’ said Perker, sealing a letter which he had just finished writing.
‘I had a great idea of marrying her myself, one of these odd days.
I thought it a very good time to say something serious to my girls; so I said what a dreadful thing it was that children should marry without their parents’ consent, and so forth; but, bless your hearts, I couldn’t make the least impression upon them.
They thought it such a much more dreadful thing that there should have been a wedding without bridesmaids, that I might as well have preached to Joe himself.’ Here the old gentleman stopped to laugh; and having done so to his heart’s content, presently resumed-- ‘But this is not the best of it, it seems.
We have been walking on mines for the last six months, and they’re sprung at last.’ ‘What do you mean?’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, turning pale; ‘no other secret marriage, I hope?’ ‘No, no,’ replied old Wardle; ‘not so bad as that; no.’ ‘What then?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick; ‘am I interested in it?’ ‘Shall I answer that question, Perker?’ said Wardle.
‘In what way?’ ‘Really,’ replied Wardle, ‘you’re such a fiery sort of a young fellow that I am almost afraid to tell you; but, however, if Perker will sit between us to prevent mischief, I’ll venture.’ Having closed the room door, and fortified himself with another application to Perker’s snuff-box, the old gentleman proceeded with his great disclosure in these words-- ‘The fact is, that my daughter Bella--Bella, who married young Trundle, you know.’ ‘Yes, yes, we know,’ said Mr. Pickwick impatiently.
My daughter Bella--Emily having gone to bed with a headache after she had read Arabella’s letter to me-- sat herself down by my side the other evening, and began to talk over this marriage affair.
“It’s quite a marriage of affection, pa,” said Bella, after a short silence.
‘“I am sorry to hear you express your opinion against marriages of affection, pa,” said Bella, colouring a little.
The long and the short of it is, then, that Bella at last mustered up courage to tell me that Emily was very unhappy; that she and your young friend Snodgrass had been in constant correspondence and communication ever since last Christmas; that she had very dutifully made up her mind to run away with him, in laudable imitation of her old friend and school-fellow; but that having some compunctions of conscience on the subject, inasmuch as I had always been rather kindly disposed to both of them, they had thought it better in the first instance to pay me the compliment of asking whether I would have any objection to their being married in the usual matter-of-fact manner.
I have no doubt that, girl- like, to enhance her own value and increase the ardour of Mr. Snodgrass, she has represented this matter in very glowing colours, and that they have both arrived at the conclusion that they are a terribly-persecuted pair of unfortunates, and have no resource but clandestine matrimony, or charcoal.
‘_I!_’ ‘I mean what did you do when your married daughter told you this?’ ‘Oh, I made a fool of myself of course,’ rejoined Wardle.
Now, whether the shake had jumbled the fat boy’s faculties together, instead of arranging them in proper order, or had roused such a quantity of new ideas within him as to render him oblivious of ordinary forms and ceremonies, or (which is also possible) had proved unsuccessful in preventing his falling asleep as he ascended the stairs, it is an undoubted fact that he walked into the sitting-room without previously knocking at the door; and so beheld a gentleman with his arms clasping his young mistress’s waist, sitting very lovingly by her side on a sofa, while Arabella and her pretty handmaid feigned to be absorbed in looking out of a window at the other end of the room.
‘Good-bye, for the present.’ The fat boy, with elephantine playfulness, stretched out his arms to ravish a kiss; but as it required no great agility to elude him, his fair enslaver had vanished before he closed them again; upon which the apathetic youth ate a pound or so of steak with a sentimental countenance, and fell fast asleep.
The ladies ran to Emily’s bedroom to dress, and the lover, taking up his hat, walked out of the room.
Arabella!’ ‘My sister!’ exclaimed Mr. Benjamin Allen, folding her in a most romantic embrace.
‘Oh, Ben, dear, how you do smell of tobacco,’ said Arabella, rather overcome by this mark of affection.
‘Bless you, Bella!’ ‘There,’ said Arabella, bending forward to kiss her brother; ‘don’t take hold of me again, Ben, dear, because you tumble me so.’ At this point of the reconciliation, Mr. Ben Allen allowed his feelings and the cigars and porter to overcome him, and looked round upon the beholders with damp spectacles.
‘A great deal,’ whispered Arabella, as she received the old gentleman’s hearty caress and congratulation.
People like you, who get married in spite of everybody, ought not to be let loose on society.
‘Don’t come near him; he’s vicious; ring the bell, and let him be taken downstairs.’ Just as Mr. Winkle caught the bell-rope in his hand, it was arrested by a general expression of astonishment; the captive lover, his face burning with confusion, suddenly walked in from the bedroom, and made a comprehensive bow to the company.
It was a painful situation to be placed in; but he now regretted it the less, inasmuch as it afforded him an opportunity of acknowledging, before their mutual friends, that he loved Mr. Wardle’s daughter deeply and sincerely; that he was proud to avow that the feeling was mutual; and that if thousands of miles were placed between them, or oceans rolled their waters, he could never for an instant forget those happy days, when first--et cetera, et cetera.
‘Dear, dear,’ said Arabella, taking up the defence, ‘what is the use of asking all that now, especially when you know you had set your covetous old heart on a richer son-in-law, and are so wild and fierce besides, that everybody is afraid of you, except me?
Shake hands with him, and order him some dinner, for goodness gracious’ sake, for he looks half starved; and pray have your wine up at once, for you’ll not be tolerable until you have taken two bottles at least.’ The worthy old gentleman pulled Arabella’s ear, kissed her without the smallest scruple, kissed his daughter also with great affection, and shook Mr. Snodgrass warmly by the hand.
She used to keep bank-notes there, ‘fore she vos married, Samivel.
The messenger fortunately found Mr. Solomon Pell in court, regaling himself, business being rather slack, with a cold collation of an Abernethy biscuit and a saveloy.
The message was no sooner whispered in his ear than he thrust them in his pocket among various professional documents, and hurried over the way with such alacrity that he reached the parlour before the messenger had even emancipated himself from the court.
I don’t say it to flatter you, gentlemen, but there are not five other men in the world, that I’d have come out of that court for, to-day.’ ‘So busy, eh?’ said Sam.
‘More widders is married than single wimin.’ ‘Very good, very good,’ said Pell, ‘you’re quite right, Mr. Weller.
Either of these gentlemen wish to go through the court?
The office of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, of the Stock Exchange, was in a first floor up a court behind the Bank of England; the house of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was at Brixton, Surrey; the horse and stanhope of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, were at an adjacent livery stable; the groom of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was on his way to the West End to deliver some game; the clerk of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, had gone to his dinner; and so Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, himself, cried, ‘Come in,’ when Mr. Pell and his companions knocked at the counting-house door.

Supposing I were desirous of establishing them comfortably as man and wife in some little business or situation, where they might hope to obtain a decent living, what should you think of it, Mr. Weller?’ At first, Mr. Weller received with wry faces a proposition involving the marriage of anybody in whom he took an interest; but, as Mr. Pickwick argued the point with him, and laid great stress on the fact that Mary was not a widow, he gradually became more tractable.
‘I wish to free you from the restraint which your present position imposes upon you, and to mark my sense of your fidelity and many excellent qualities, by enabling you to marry this girl at once, and to earn an independent livelihood for yourself and family.
He derived, at that moment, more pride and luxury of feeling from the disinterested attachment of his humble friends, than ten thousand protestations from the greatest men living could have awakened in his heart.
Nathaniel Winkle, who married the son of the old man at Birmingham?’ said the stranger, eyeing Arabella with visible curiosity.
‘You have been recently married, ma’am?’ ‘I have,’ replied Arabella, in a scarcely audible tone, laying aside her work, and becoming greatly agitated as a thought, that had occurred to her before, struck more forcibly upon her mind.
‘And without having sufficient property of your own to afford your husband any permanent assistance in exchange for the worldly advantages which you knew he would have gained if he had married agreeably to his father’s wishes?’ said the old gentleman.
‘This is what boys and girls call disinterested affection, till they have boys and girls of their own, and then they see it in a rougher and very different light!’ Arabella’s tears flowed fast, as she pleaded in extenuation that she was young and inexperienced; that her attachment had alone induced her to take the step to which she had resorted; and that she had been deprived of the counsel and guidance of her parents almost from infancy.
It was romantic, unbusinesslike, foolish.’ ‘It was my fault; all my fault, Sir,’ replied poor Arabella, weeping.
‘Nonsense,’ said the old gentleman; ‘it was not your fault that he fell in love with you, I suppose?
‘I am very sorry to have done anything which has lessened your affection for me, Sir,’ said Mr. Winkle; ‘but I will say, at the same time, that I have no reason to be ashamed of having this lady for my wife, nor you of having her for a daughter.’ ‘Give me your hand, Nat,’ said the old gentleman, in an altered voice.
‘Kiss me, my love.
Sam had dutifully seen his father to the Belle Sauvage, when, on returning, he encountered the fat boy in the court, who had been charged with the delivery of a note from Emily Wardle.
‘It is singular enough that I had intended to volunteer a full explanation this very day; so, if you will give me another glass of wine, I will satisfy your curiosity.’ The decanters passed from hand to hand with unwonted briskness, and Mr. Pickwick, looking round on the faces of his friends with a cheerful smile, proceeded-- ‘All the changes that have taken place among us,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘I mean the marriage that _has _taken place, and the marriage that WILL take place, with the changes they involve, rendered it necessary for me to think, soberly and at once, upon my future plans.
It is fully prepared for my reception, and I intend entering upon it at once, trusting that I may yet live to spend many quiet years in peaceful retirement, cheered through life by the society of my friends, and followed in death by their affectionate remembrance.’ Here Mr. Pickwick paused, and a low murmur ran round the table.
I wish, if my friend Wardle entertains no objection, that his daughter should be married from my new house, on the day I take possession of it.
It will warm my heart to witness the happiness of those friends who are dearest to me, beneath my own roof.’ Mr. Pickwick paused again: Emily and Arabella sobbed audibly.
There were few preparatory arrangements to be made for the marriage of Mr. Snodgrass.
His account of both was quite satisfactory to Wardle--as almost any other account would have been, for the good old gentleman was overflowing with hilarity and kindness--and a handsome portion having been bestowed upon Emily, the marriage was fixed to take place on the fourth day from that time--the suddenness of which preparations reduced three dressmakers and a tailor to the extreme verge of insanity.
Communicating his intelligence to the old lady with characteristic impetuosity, she instantly fainted away; but being promptly revived, ordered the brocaded silk gown to be packed up forthwith, and proceeded to relate some circumstances of a similar nature attending the marriage of the eldest daughter of Lady Tollimglower, deceased, which occupied three hours in the recital, and were not half finished at last.
And in the midst of all this, stood Mr. Pickwick, his countenance lighted up with smiles, which the heart of no man, woman, or child, could resist: himself the happiest of the group: shaking hands, over and over again, with the same people, and when his own hands were not so employed, rubbing them with pleasure: turning round in a different direction at every fresh expression of gratification or curiosity, and inspiring everybody with his looks of gladness and delight.
Mr. Tupman, when his friends married, and Mr. Pickwick settled, took lodgings at Richmond, where he has ever since resided.
Mrs. Bardell let lodgings to many conversable single gentlemen, with great profit, but never brought any more actions for breach of promise of marriage.
The old housekeeper dying at the end of that time, Mr. Pickwick promoted Mary to the situation, on condition of her marrying Mr. Weller at once, which she did without a murmur.

the_silverado_squatters

And though in a few years from now the whole district may be smiling with farms, passing trains shaking the mountain to the heart, many-windowed hotels lighting up the night like factories, and a prosperous city occupying the site of sleepy Calistoga; yet in the mean time, around the foot of that mountain the silence of nature reigns in a great measure unbroken, and the people of hill and valley go sauntering about their business as in the days before the flood.
The tangled, woody, and almost trackless foot-hills that enclose the valley, shutting it off from Sonoma on the west, and from Yolo on the east—rough as they were in outline, dug out by winter streams, crowned by cliffy bluffs and nodding pine trees—wore dwarfed into satellites by the bulk and bearing of Mount Saint Helena.
The sun warmed me to the heart.
Without doubt he had tried his luck at the diggings, and got no good from that; without doubt he had loved the bottle, and lived the life of Jack ashore.
“I was cleaning up the pasture for my beasts, when I found _this_”—kicking a great redwood seven feet in diameter, that lay there on its side, hollow heart, clinging lumps of bark, all changed into gray stone, with veins of quartz between what had been the layers of the wood.
When I mentioned I was from Scotland, “My old country,” he said; “my old country”—with a smiling look and a tone of real affection in his voice.
Doubtless, the heart of the geologist beats quicker at the sight; but, for my part, I was mightily unmoved.
To Mr. Schram this was a solemn office; his serious gusto warmed my heart; prosperity had not yet wholly banished a certain neophite and girlish trepidation, and he followed every sip and read my face with proud anxiety.
So local, so quintessential is a wine, that it seems the very birds in the verandah might communicate a flavour, and that romantic cellar influence the bottle next to be uncorked in Pimlico, and the smile of jolly Mr. Schram might mantle in the glass.
CHAPTER IV—THE SCOT ABROAD A FEW pages back, I wrote that a man belonged, in these days, to a variety of countries; but the old land is still the true love, the others are but pleasant infidelities.
Yet let us meet in some far country, and, whether we hail from the braes of Manor or the braes of Mar, some ready-made affection joins us on the instant.
And yet somewhere, deep down in the heart of each one of us, something yearns for the old land, and the old kindly people.
Of all mysteries of the human heart, this is perhaps the most inscrutable.
And though I think I would rather die elsewhere, yet in my heart of hearts I long to be buried among good Scots clods.
Another Scotchman there was, a resident, who for the more love of the common country, douce, serious, religious man, drove me all about the valley, and took as much interest in me as if I had been his son: more, perhaps; for the son has faults too keenly felt, while the abstract countryman is perfect—like a whiff of peats.
Mrs. Kelmar was a singularly kind woman; and the oldest son had quite a dark and romantic bearing, and might be heard on summer evenings playing sentimental airs on the violin.
It lay partly open; and sixty or a hundred feet above our head, we could see the strata propped apart by solid wooden wedges, and a pine, half undermined, precariously nodding on the verge.
Take them for all in all, few people have done my heart more good; they seemed so thoroughly entitled to happiness, and to enjoy it in so large a measure and so free from after-thought; almost they persuaded me to be a Jew.
I stood under the shadow of that tree for, I suppose, hard upon an hour, and had not the heart to be angry.
I love these sweet, fiery pangs, but I will not court them.
The ladies each narrated the story of her marriage, our two Hebrews with the prettiest combination of sentiment and financial bathos.
The heart fails me.
“You see, I don’t mind if it was only five dollars, Mr. Stevens,” he said, “but I must give Mr. Kelmar _something_.” Even now, when the whole tyranny is plain to me, I cannot find it in my heart to be as angry as perhaps I should be with the Hebrew tyrant.
He had been nurtured tenderly in the society of ladies; his heart was large and soft; he regarded the sofa-cushion as a bed-rook necessary of existence.
Though about the size of a sheep, he loved to sit in ladies’ laps; he never said a bad word in all his blameless days; and if he had seen a flute, I am sure he could have played upon it by nature.
He lay long in bed in the morning—rarely indeed, rose before noon; he loved all games, from poker to clerical croquet; and in the Toll House croquet ground I have seen him toiling at the latter with the devotion of a curate.
You would not have thought it, from his uneasy manners and troubled, struggling utterance; but he loved himself to the marrow, and was happy and proud like a peacock on a rail.
His physical strength was wonderful; and to have a woman stand by and admire his achievements, warmed his heart like sunshine.
His hunting-suit, for instance, had cost I should be afraid to say how many bucks—the currency in which he paid his way: it was all befringed, after the Indian fashion, and it was dear to his heart.
I could trace its progress, one pine tree first growing hazy and then disappearing after another; although sometimes there was none of this fore-running haze, but the whole opaque white ocean gave a start and swallowed a piece of mountain at a gulp.
The old landmarks, by whose disappearance I had measured its advance, here a crag, there a brave pine tree, now began, in the inverse order, to make their reappearance into daylight.
The imagination loves to trifle with what is not.
Here and there a few treetops were discovered and then whelmed again; and for one second, the bough of a dead pine beckoned out of the spray like the arm of a drowning man.
Busy Mrs. Corwin and her busy Chinaman might be heard indeed, in the penetralia, pounding dough or rattling dishes; or perhaps Rufe had called up some of the sleepers for a game of croquet, and the hollow strokes of the mallet sounded far away among the woods: but with these exceptions, it was sleep and sunshine and dust, and the wind in the pine trees, all day long.
Yet, out of our great solitude of four and twenty mountain hours, we thrilled to their momentary presence gauged and divined them, loved and hated; and stood light-headed in that storm of human electricity.
As I recall the place—the green dell below; the spires of pine; the sun-warm, scented air; that gray, gabled inn, with its faint stirrings of life amid the slumber of the mountains—I slowly awake to a sense of admiration, gratitude, and almost love.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The one tall pine beside the ledge was steeped in silver.
Our own house, the forge, the dump, the chutes, the rails, the windlass, the mass of broken plant; the two tunnels, one far below in the green dell, the other on the platform where we kept our wine; the deep shaft, with the sun-glints and the water-drops; above all, the ledge, that great gaping slice out of the mountain shoulder, propped apart by wooden wedges, on whose immediate margin, high above our heads, the one tall pine precariously nodded—these stood for its greatness; while, the dog-hutch, boot-jacks, old boots, old tavern bills, and the very beds that we inherited from bygone miners, put in human touches and realized for us the story of the past.
Caliban was absent, but he had been chary of his friendly visits since the row; and with that exception, the whole family was gathered together as for a marriage or a christening.
In the crannies of the ledge and about the spurs of the tall pine, a red flowering stone-plant hung in clusters.
I am ingloriously ignorant of these subjects; had never heard of such a beast; thought myself face to face with some incomparable sport of nature; and began to cherish hopes of immortality in science.
Rarely have I been conscious of a stranger thrill than when I raised that singular creature from the stones, dry as a board, his innocent heart long quiet, and all warm with sunshine.

a_tale_of_two_cities

A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it!
No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all.
My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life’s end.
“I kiss your hand, miss,” said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.
He married--an English lady--and I was one of the trustees.
As I was saying--” Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew: “As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.” “I entreat you to tell me more, sir.” “I will.
And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.” As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey.
Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.” A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his.
Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place to write such words in?” In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally, perhaps not) upon the joker’s heart.
And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him, trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.
By degrees, in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say: “What is this?” With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she laid his ruined head there.
Kiss me, kiss me!
If you touch, in touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it!
If, when I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away, weep for it, weep for it!” She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a child.
And if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living, and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it!
I feel his sacred tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart.
Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.
Name the price that you put _your_ prayers at!” “They only come from the heart, Jerry.
He will then let you in.” “Into the court, sir?” “Into the court.” Mr. Cruncher’s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to interchange the inquiry, “What do you think of this?” “Am I to wait in the court, sir?” he asked, as the result of that conference.
But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench.
After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into court.
Mr. Lorry sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged gentleman, the prisoner’s counsel, who had a great bundle of papers before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court.
The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court, stopped the dialogue.
Eager faces strained round pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court, laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help themselves, at anybody’s cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.
Silence in the court!
The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.
It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left.
That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the prisoner’s schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his Majesty’s Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.
That, he had been the prisoner’s friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country.
That, Virtue, as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues; whereat the jury’s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.
When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in anticipation of what he was soon to become.
The wigged gentleman sitting opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.
He loved his country, and couldn’t bear it, and had given information.
His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart.
“Yes, my Lord.” “Then say the prisoner.” “When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father,” turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, “was much fatigued and in a very weak state of health.
Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness, when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington.
Some three years, or three years and a half ago.” “Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or speak to his conversation with your daughter?” “Sir, I can do neither.” “Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?” He answered, in a low voice, “There is.” “Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?” He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, “A long imprisonment.” “Were you newly released on the occasion in question?” “They tell me so.” “Have you no remembrance of the occasion?” “None.
The prisoner’s counsel was cross-examining this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him.
Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court, changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement.
The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in the court were now being lighted.
The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all eyes, ears, and spikes.
But I think their withdrawing is in your favour.” Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other in manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above them.
The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along with them.
Congratulatory From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr. Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from death.
Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked.
“It is a pity you have not, sir.” “I think so, too.” “If you had,” pursued Mr. Lorry, “perhaps you would attend to it.” “Lord love you, no!--I shouldn’t,” said Mr. Carton.
Stryver never had a case in hand, anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat.
Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or more, before it found the glass for his lips.
In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.
But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven him), to take Ladybird’s affections away from me.” Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives.
He knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson’s.
I will not say with me, though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him?
In silence they go walking up and down together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have brought him to himself.” Notwithstanding Miss Pross’s denial of her own imagination, there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea, in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to her possessing such a thing.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>For the love of the great God!
Driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife.
Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay’s way--the way of the love of a woman.
He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger.
But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long, long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.
“I have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,” so he at length began, “for some year and a half, that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may not--” He was stayed by the Doctor’s putting out his hand to stop him.
It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.” “It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!” he said deferentially.
“Yes, go on.” “You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden.
Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly, disinterestedly, devotedly.
If ever there were love in the world, I love her.
You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!” The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the ground.
“I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.” He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or raise his eyes.
“I know,” said Darnay, respectfully, “how can I fail to know, Doctor Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child.
I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy itself.
I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted, loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration.
I have felt, and do even now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself.
But I love her.
Heaven is my witness that I love her!” “I believe it,” answered her father, mournfully.
If I had any such possibility, even at a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not now touch this honoured hand.” He laid his own upon it as he spoke.
“You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so.
Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?” “None.
I well understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I could retain no place in it against her love for her father.” “If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?” “I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor’s favour, would outweigh herself and all the world.
Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate.
“Is sought by any other suitor?” “It is what I meant to say.” Her father considered a little before he answered: “You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself.
If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--” The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke: “--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her sake.
If your suit should prosper, if Lucie should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning.
Find out some respectable woman with a little property--somebody in the landlady way, or lodging-letting way--and marry her, against a rainy day.
His way taking him past Tellson’s, and he both banking at Tellson’s and knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr. Stryver’s mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness of the Soho horizon.
“I am going,” said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him: “I am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.” “Oh dear me!” cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his visitor dubiously.
But, as an old fellow, who has carried Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have spoken.
On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal that “he had thought better of that marrying matter”) had carried his delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney’s feet still trod those stones.
I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.” “Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget it!” She was pale and trembling.
“If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken, poor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you, disgrace you, pull you down with him.
Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life, the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world; and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity.” “Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!” “Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette.
In the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried in your heart.
If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you.
O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a happy father’s face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!” He said, “Farewell!” said a last “God bless you!” and left her.
Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed Tellson’s.
“Who is it?” “_I_ don’t know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour, “Spies!
Under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the court, followed out into the streets.
The latter he was intimate with, and affectionately embraced.
You are faint of heart to-night, my dear!” “Well, then,” said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his breast, “it _is_ a long time.” “It is a long time,” repeated his wife; “and when is it not a long time?
“She was pretty enough to have been married long ago.
After sipping his cognac to the end, he added: “Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married.
), it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present Marquis.
In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like her--such as the world will do well never to breed again.
Lucie was to be married to-morrow.
I am deeply happy in the love that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles’s love for me.
But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and self-reproachful now than I can tell you.
In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?” Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed, “Quite sure, my darling!
More than that,” he added, as he tenderly kissed her: “my future is far brighter, Lucie, seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever was--without it.” “If I could hope _that_, my father!--” “Believe it, love!
Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.” She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.
I have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate.
Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.” “You, Lucie?
“In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight, coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father.
Her life was active, cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.” “I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love that was I.” “And she showed me her children,” said the Doctor of Beauvais, “and they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me.
O my dear, my dear, will you bless me as fervently to-morrow?” “Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great happiness.
There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross.
The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it, by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.
He regretted that Charles was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.
She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his sorrows deserved.
Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once more, and went away.
You leave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson’s shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him.
And when, at the fortnight’s end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on your other fortnight’s trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame.
Let me kiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his own.” For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.
The rest followed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.
This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry’s friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.
The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry’s hope darkened, and his heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.
With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time.
So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe advance, he at first supposed that his daughter’s marriage had taken place yesterday.
“Now, my dear Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most considerate and most affectionate way, “I am a mere man of business, and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters.
No man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine, if I knew how.
He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic; he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things.
Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.” He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry’s face.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>What will I not promise to my Love?” What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!
I would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep wounds in it.
If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets, could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband, he might have cried to the night--and the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time-- “God bless her for her sweet compassion!” CHAPTER XXI.
For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.
Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her: doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided her breast.
Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant smile, “Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!” those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother’s cheek, as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it.
No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive delicacy of pity for him.
Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.
How near to her heart the echoes of her child’s tread came, and those of her own dear father’s, always active and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband’s, need not be told.
Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her “What is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?” But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time.
Every pulse and heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.
Their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases.
_Had_ he reason?” Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he could have heard the answering cry.
Husbands, and brothers, and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from him!
Defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, “Bring him out!
Saint Antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his head and heart on pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession through the streets.
Fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children; and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and hoped.
Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers, London, England.” On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate between them.
“For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to succour and release me.
He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie, his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own mind, had been hurried and incomplete.
Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible attraction.
“My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry at parting, “and take precious care of them till I come back.” Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage rolled away.
But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it, so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and the day passed quickly.
Early in the evening he embraced her, and her scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye (an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets, with a heavier heart.
“For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name!” was the poor prisoner’s cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and floated away for the Loadstone Rock.
“Is this the emigrant Evrémonde?” “This is the man.” “Your age, Evrémonde?” “Thirty-seven.” “Married, Evrémonde?” “Yes.” “Where married?” “In England.” “Without doubt.
“Is it you,” said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, “who married the daughter of Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?” “Yes,” replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.
“How many more!” The gaoler’s wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely replied, “One must have patience, my dear!” Three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, “For the love of Liberty;” which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion.
He turned at the grated door, to render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler’s hand; and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.
“Don’t be so terrified, my love.
I know you are true.” The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor’s arm, and looked out with him into the courtyard.
His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water, carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.
He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband.
It was so much, however, to her who received it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the hands that knitted.
It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took to its knitting again.
As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid of Heaven I will do it!” Thus, Doctor Manette.
The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him.
It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache, it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack.
Sometimes, at night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven, was on him.
He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her, with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work.
In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.
It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the heart.
You may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.” “I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!” “You cannot see him, my poor dear?” “No, father,” said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand, “no.” A footstep in the snow.
“Give me your arm, my love.
Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters: National Property.
In seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it.
But he had married in England?
As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing.
After grasping the Doctor’s hand, as he stood victorious and proud before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole; after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their rooms.
All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be.
_You_, your father’s daughter!” “I thought, my father,” said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face and in a faltering voice, “that I heard strange feet upon the stairs.” “My love, the staircase is as still as Death.” As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.
Who’s this man?” Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother, said through her tears, “Mr.
“Now,” said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, “what do you want?” “How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from!” cried Miss Pross, “to give me such a greeting, and show me no affection.” “There.
“Far rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever loved you truly, and ever shall.
Say but one affectionate word to me, and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will detain you no longer.” Good Miss Pross!
He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case, all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder, hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question: “I say!
She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection, and with Sydney’s friendly reassurances, adequately to heed what she observed.
Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of,” said Sydney, “and has acknowledged the relationship.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I didn’t quite mean what I said.” “It _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?” “Surely, surely.” “If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night, ‘I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!’ your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they not?” “You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.” Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a few moments, said: “I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off?
My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!
He carried the child over, and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.
But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays.
As its silent track in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors, ended in the words, “I am the resurrection and the life.” Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone.
The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd.
When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart.
Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.” “Good.” “Thérèse Defarge, his wife.” “Good.” “Alexandre Manette, physician.” A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.
Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of his having been a mere boy in the Doctor’s service, and of the release, and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him.
This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.
I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of the President.” “Let it be read.” In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as follows.
“‘Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married.
He was ailing at that time, poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort him in our cottage--our dog-hut, as that man would call it.
She had not been married many weeks, when that man’s brother saw her and admired her, and asked that man to lend her to him--for what are husbands among us!
When I took the tidings home, our father’s heart burst; he never spoke one of the words that filled it.
“Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the pulse and the heart.
“She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage.
What I have left to call my own--it is little beyond the worth of a few jewels--I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if the sister can be discovered.’ “She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, ‘It is for thine own dear sake.
Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?’ The child answered her bravely, ‘Yes!’ I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and went away caressing him.
When my servant came into the room where I sat with my wife--O my wife, beloved of my heart!
“If it had pleased _God_ to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or dead--I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them.
At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People.
The quick noise and movement of the court’s emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face but love and consolation.
If I might embrace him once!
Barsad proposed to the rest, “Let her embrace him then; it is but a moment.” It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.
My parting blessing on my love.
I kiss her by you.
I feel that this will break my heart by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.” Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying: “No, no!
We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and duty.
As he went out at the prisoners’ door, she turned, laid her head lovingly on her father’s breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his feet.
Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?” He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face.
“Before I go,” he said, and paused--“I may kiss her?” It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words.
I have observed her in the court, and I have observed her in the street by the prison.
“You are a noble heart.
He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it--outwatched the awful night.
Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear.
There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts, a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against resignation.
He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage.
Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father.
Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and he had never gone away.
Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn.
As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him, as having a knowledge of him.
Such a poor weak little creature!” As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.
Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican; something new in thy family; remember it!
I love it.
Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual, to-day.” “I willingly obey the orders of my Chief,” said The Vengeance with alacrity, and kissing her cheek.
Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe.
Second: them poor things well out o’ this, and never no more will I interfere with Mrs. Cruncher’s flopping, never no more!” “Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,” said Miss Pross, striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, “I have no doubt it is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence.--O my poor darlings!” “I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--“and let my words be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my opinions respectin’ flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present time.” “There, there, there!
It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross, with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate, clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had.
“But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might have hope and comfort here to-day.
Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home together, and to rest in her bosom.
I am very ignorant, and it troubles me--just a little.” “Tell me what it is.” “I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I love very dearly.
Am I to kiss you now?
Is the moment come?” “Yes.” She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other.

TO THE HESITATING PURCHASER If sailor tales to sailor tunes, Storm and adventure, heat and cold, If schooners, islands, and maroons, And buccaneers, and buried gold, And all the old romance, retold Exactly in the ancient way, Can please, as me they pleased of old, The wiser youngsters of today: --So be it, and fall on!
In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more.
It was the second death I had known, and the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart.
My heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon this dangerous venture.
When we were about half-way through, I suddenly put my hand upon her arm, for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouth--the tap-tapping of the blind man’s stick upon the frozen road.
“She’ll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife, sir.
Ah, but I’ve lived easy in the meantime, never denied myself o’ nothing heart desires, and slep’ soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea.
Split my sides, I’ve a sick heart to sail with the likes of you!” “Easy all, Long John,” cried Israel.
I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength, but my limbs and heart alike misgave me.
“Sir, I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up.” “Well, gentlemen,” said the captain, “the best that I can say is not much.
This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands, and by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others--some singly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad.
Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I hated the very thought of Treasure Island.
And here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart.
My eyes turned instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine.
As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless, courage glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him.
But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet.
He was stone dead--shot through the heart.
The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand, crying like a child.
But towards the end of the bombardment, though still I durst not venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell oftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again, and after a long detour to the east, crept down among the shore-side trees.
The log-house was made of unsquared trunks of pine--roof, walls, and floor.
My heart, and here’s promotion!” Long John answered for himself.
I glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped against my ribs.
Once I shipped a sea so heavy that I had to stop and bail, with my heart fluttering like a bird, but gradually I got into the way of the thing and guided my coracle among the waves, with only now and then a blow upon her bows and a dash of foam in my face.
The moan, which told of pain and deadly weakness, and the way in which his jaw hung open went right to my heart.
S’pose we talks.” “Why, yes,” says I, “with all my heart, Mr.
I had now plenty of water and good things to eat, and my conscience, which had smitten me hard for my desertion, was quieted by the great conquest I had made.
It was such a game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove, but never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly beating heart as now.
And yet I wondered, in my heart, that he should show himself so careless.
I stopped, with much wonder in my heart, and perhaps a little terror also.
As I drew nearer, my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened.
I could only judge that all had perished, and my heart smote me sorely that I had not been there to perish with them.
They had set me with my back against the wall, and I stood there, looking Silver in the face, pluckily enough, I hope, to all outward appearance, but with black despair in my heart.
Through all this sneering talk, I was made to feel the threat of death that overhung me, and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast.
But one thing I’ll say, and no more; if you spare me, bygones are bygones, and when you fellows are in court for piracy, I’ll save you all I can.
I stood straight up against the wall, my heart still going like a sledge-hammer, but with a ray of hope now shining in my bosom.
“You always was brisk for business, and has the rules by heart, George, as I’m pleased to see.
Dick’s crossed his luck and spoiled his Bible, and that’s about all.” “It’ll do to kiss the book on still, won’t it?” growled Dick, who was evidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself.
He himself slept peacefully and snored aloud, yet my heart was sore for him, wicked as he was, to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet that awaited him.
Heaven knows, I cannot find it in my heart to blame you, but this much I will say, be it kind or unkind: when Captain Smollett was well, you dared not have gone off; and when he was ill and couldn’t help it, by George, it was downright cowardly!” I will own that I here began to weep.
“As for hostage,” he continued, “that’s his last talk, I guess, with them he loves so dear.
Add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the behaviour of my friends, their unexplained desertion of the stockade, their inexplicable cession of the chart, or harder still to understand, the doctor’s last warning to Silver, “Look out for squalls when you find it,” and you will readily believe how little taste I found in my breakfast and with how uneasy a heart I set forth behind my captors on the quest for treasure.
At the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green creeper, which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones, a human skeleton lay, with a few shreds of clothing, on the ground.
I believe a chill struck for a moment to every heart.
Dear heart, but he died bad, did Flint!” “Aye, that he did,” observed another; “now he raged, and now he hollered for the rum, and now he sang.
“Mates,” says he, “there’s two of them alone there; one’s the old cripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this; the other’s that cub that I mean to have the heart of.
Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the skeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he had dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the excavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at the north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA.
“As for you, Jim,” he said, “it went against my heart, but I did what I thought best for those who had stood by their duty; and if you were not one of these, whose fault was it?” That morning, finding that I was to be involved in the horrid disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers, he had run all the way to the cave, and leaving the squire to guard the captain, had taken Gray and the maroon and started, making the diagonal across the island to be at hand beside the pine.
Gray not only saved his money, but being suddenly smit with the desire to rise, also studied his profession, and he is now mate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship, married besides, and the father of a family.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[Illustration] _Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it brings a curious consequence with it.
There is much more difference as to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and proper thing to love them.
The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous; yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and Sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does not want them._ _I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes would, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge of vulgarity) would go for_ Emma.
All the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr. Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the same unostentatious, but masterly fashion.
Although Miss Austen always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from the gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive aversion to actual love.
A man in the early eighteenth century, of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early nineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart, would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate husband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play at blind-man’s-buff.
But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel of fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected Mentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the days of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s own, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over her son.
It is possible that the romantic paste in her composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly anybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality.
With Mary, Miss Austen has taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her; not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting traditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming her privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and singing too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but perhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings in that Fordyce-belectured generation.
It is at any rate difficult not to extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and respect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr. Collins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall.
It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while his falling in love at all is not extremely probable.
His being neither is exactly consistent with the probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love.
As for his being in love, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that phenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state, only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal charm._ _The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather to be felt than to be explained.
And she lets the injury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._ _Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a common form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her playfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.
But I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have married Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’ conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked to the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della Cruscans of this._ _And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of charm?--it is there.
In the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at least five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can help doing so.
I should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; I should, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Diana and Barbara.
But to live with and to marry, I do not know that any one of the four can come into competition with Elizabeth._ _GEORGE SAINTSBURY._ [Illustration: List of Illustrations.]

You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.” “Is that his design in settling here?” “Design?
But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.” “I see no occasion for that.
I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.” “I desire you will do no such thing.
The business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.
Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.” “Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, I’m the tallest.” The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.
“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.” In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.
[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]] CHAPTER V. [Illustration] Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate.
The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.
“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.” “Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to.” “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.
By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.
It was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.
We can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection than she feels.
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.” “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal.” “Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.” “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.
A lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment.
She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in his regimentals.” “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.” Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane.
It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.” “It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said Bingley.
“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper, “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.” “Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,-- “I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.
“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it would not make them one jot less agreeable.” “But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.
She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.” “I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.” “In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.” Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.” “With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.” “I am talking of possibilities, Charles.” “Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.” Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.
When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.” “And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently.
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!” “I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.
“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.
Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.” “To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you.” “To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.” “You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
Mr. Darcy may hug himself.” “Mr.
I dearly love a laugh.” “Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be.
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.
Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.
Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.
Lydia, my love, ring the bell.
“He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.” “There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.” “Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.” Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,-- “You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.
The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.
Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.” Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.
Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence; and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.” “How strange!” cried Elizabeth.
He has also _brotherly_ pride, which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.” “What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?” He shook his head.
As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.
She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley’s two sisters.
When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley.
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.
Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.” The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued,-- “My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.
Collins, you must marry.
A clergyman like you must marry.
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.
My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.
As I must, therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.” “I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.
[Illustration] Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.
She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it.” “Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.” Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by her communication.
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.” “Let her be called down.
I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage.
“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?” “I have, sir.” “Very well.
Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_.” Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him.” “My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.
But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.
My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman’s heart.
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.
No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she is not such a simpleton.
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.
But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.” “If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your representation of all this might make me quite easy.
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.” “But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?” “You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you, by all means, to refuse him.” “How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that, though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate.” “I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.” “But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.
Jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together.
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever [Illustration: “So much love and eloquence” [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]] excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James’s.
Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.
Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.” “Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.
The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,-- “Engaged to Mr. Collins!
“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised, very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.
I am not romantic, you know.
I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.” Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.
The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted.
Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?” Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.
After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring.
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others.
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.” Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister’s warm affection.
There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.
I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention, the other is Charlotte’s marriage.
Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.” “To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.
My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking.
They may wish many things besides his happiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.” “Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane; “but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.
They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.
By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.
“So, Lizzy,” said he, one day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find.
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.
We must not all expect Jane’s good fortune.” “True,” said Mr. Bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it.” Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.
[Illustration] After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.
A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.” [Illustration: “Offended two or three young ladies” [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]] “An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth; “but it will not do for _us_.
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.” “But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.
Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley’s love?” “I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.
Is not general incivility the very essence of love?” “Oh, yes!
of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s attractions.
Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.
About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged.
[Illustration] Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:-- “You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.
Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.
He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.” “Elizabeth, you are not serious now.” “I beg your pardon.
At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.
In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wiser to resist?
His marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but, if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.
I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.
His character sunk on every review of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.
There can be no love in all this.
My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.
Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William’s too long.
Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.” “If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.” “She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.
If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?” “But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event.” “A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.
I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.” “Oh, if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better.
She saw instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage: his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family.
About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.” Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings.
She asked her at different times how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name?
The younger ones out before the elder are married!
But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.
I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.” “Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?” Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.
Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.” Elizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his cousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.
My friend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.
“My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way.” But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.
Colonel Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.
He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.
Younger sons cannot marry where they like.” “Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.” “Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.” “Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is the usual price of an earl’s younger son?
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.
What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.” “Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?” “I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.” “And what arts did he use to separate them?” “He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling.
“He only told me what I have now told you.” Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.” “That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.” This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the Parsonage.
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.” Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression.
He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.
Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?” As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued,-- “I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!
that he should have been in love with her for so many months!
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible!
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.
Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.
I had often seen him in love before.
At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.
My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.
But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference.
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal, regard.
</pre></div>

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement.
Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind.
But vanity, not love, has been my folly.
Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were concerned.
Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.
While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.
His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.
After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.
There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you!
Have you had any flirting?
how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty!
how I should like to be married before any of you!
Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.” “Poor Wickham!
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.
Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.
Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done.” But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer.
“How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?” Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.
This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.
A resemblance in good-humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.
Her character will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.
Oh, my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?” Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and, affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,-- “Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.
She saw all the glories of the camp: its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.
[Illustration: “Tenderly flirting” [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]] Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?
Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.
She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.
But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.
In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.
“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?” said her aunt.
“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?” “Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.” “Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.” “If your master would marry, you might see more of him.” “Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.
It is impossible that he should still love me.” After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.
It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.
Such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps.
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.
Though Lydia’s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B., intending to trace their route.
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?
I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted.
It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.
Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her.
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment, that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible.
For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.” “But why all this secrecy?
Why must their marriage be private?
His most particular friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?
Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.” “But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?” “It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away.
Elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.
The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.” They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.
In a few days more, we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.
And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry.
And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married.
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.
He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.” “And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ I am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.” “And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?” “How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?
I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.
She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other many weeks.” “But not before they went to Brighton?” “No, I believe not.” “And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?
I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.
Give my love to Colonel Forster.
“Your affectionate friend, “LYDIA BENNET.” “Oh, thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had finished it.
Let me advise you, then, my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.
Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?” As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.
It is enough to know they are discovered: I have seen them both----” [Illustration: “But perhaps you would like to read it” [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]] “Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane: “they are married!” Elizabeth read on: “I have seen them both.
They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.
We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve.
“Can it be possible that he will marry her?” “Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,” said her sister.
I am only ashamed of his asking so little.” “And they _must_ marry!
Yet he is _such_ a man.” “Yes, yes, they must marry.
my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?” “I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.” “That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me before.
“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!
Oh, Lydia!” “I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.
His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.” “Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor I, nor anybody, can ever forget.
As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.
To know that her daughter would be married was enough.
She will be married!
She will be married at sixteen!
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.” Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.
Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children.
He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement.
But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery was considered certain.
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion.
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Had Lydia’s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.
“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his marriage was fixed on.
But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the north.
[Illustration: “With an affectionate smile” [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]] CHAPTER LI.
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.
when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.” Her father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,-- “Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day?
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister,-- “Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman.” It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.
Wickham” by each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.
Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him.
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.
We were married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in that parish.
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.
Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day.
The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him.
She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.
Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been _his_ design.
Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.
Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.
But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him.
Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her.
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.
She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.
I wonder what he can be doing there.” “Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said Elizabeth.
In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.” She held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.
But you know married women have never much time for writing.
They will have nothing else to do.” Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s.
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.
One seems so forlorn without them.” “This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said Elizabeth.
Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off.
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.
The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.
Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my own daughters.
“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,” continued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken away from me.
“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be in company with either of them.
Let me never see either one or the other again!” Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover.
take care.” “My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.” “I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.” They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit, had revived.
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?
I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.
We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.
I did not wink at you.” She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,-- “Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.
Bingley was everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.
“I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself.
She will be down in a moment, I dare say.” He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.
They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.
You will be a very happy woman.” Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.
It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.” “Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again?” “He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.” This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.
Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.
My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man, who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.” “You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a short silence.
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come.” Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.
Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?” “Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.” “It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.
While in their cradles we planned the union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family?
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh.
You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage.
If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.” “In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.
Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make _their_ marriage at all more probable?
I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle.
No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy.
And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.” “And this is your real opinion!
but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea.
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce.
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.
‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.
Pray read on.” “‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr. Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known.
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.
The happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but though she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.
“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?” “From the former.
At night she opened her heart to Jane.
He still loves me, and we are engaged.” Jane looked at her doubtingly.
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable.
And do you really love him quite well enough?
do anything rather than marry without affection.
You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I tell you all.” “What do you mean?” “Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.
Will you tell me how long you have loved him?” “It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began; but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.” Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.
Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage.
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.” “I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.
You know not what you are about.” Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.” He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.” Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.
Three daughters married!
And a special licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.
But, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.” This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’ consent, there was still something to be wished for.
[Illustration] Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.
To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love.” “Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?” “Dearest Jane!
My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know everything.” “Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.
or had you intended any more serious consequences?” “My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.
But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err.
Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me.
Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere.
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.
Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do.
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.
If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy.
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and, in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.
They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended.
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.
But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.
With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms.
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

Swift as a cat she runs, with her garment gathered high, Leaping, nimble of foot, running, certain of eye; And ever to guide her way over the smooth and the sharp, Ever nearer and nearer the note of the one-stringed harp; Till at length, in a glade of the wood, with a naked mountain above, The sound of the harp thrown down, and she in the arms of her love.
“Rua,”—“Taheia,” they cry—“my heart, my soul, and my eyes,” And clasp and sunder and kiss, with lovely laughter and sighs, “Rua!”—“Taheia, my love,”—“Rua, star of my night, Clasp me, hold me, and love me, single spring of delight.” And Rua folded her close, he folded her near and long, The living knit to the living, and sang the lover’s song: _Night_, _night it is_, _night upon the palms_.
Why should a lowly lover have touched Taheia’s skirt, Taheia the well-descended, and Rua child of the dirt?” “—On high with the haka-ikis my father sits in state, Ten times fifty kinsmen salute him in the gate; Round all his martial body, and in bands across his face, The marks of the tattooer proclaim his lofty place.
Love, love, beloved Rua, love levels all degrees, And the well-tattooed Taheia clings panting to your knees.” “—Taheia, song of the morning, how long is the longest love?
Pity my yearning heart, pity my girlish years!
Patience to lie in wait, cunning to follow the sleuth, Abroad the foes I have fought, and at home the friends of my youth.” “Love, love, beloved Rua, love has a clearer eye, Hence from the arms of love you go not forth to die.
Lie secret there, my Rua, in the arms of awful gods, Sleep in the shade of the trees on the couch of the kindly sods, Sleep and dream of Taheia, Taheia will wake for you; And whenever the land wind blows and the woods are heavy with dew, Alone through the horror of night, {72} with food for the soul of her love, Taheia the undissuaded will hurry true as the dove.” “Taheia, the pit of the night crawls with treacherous things, Spirits of ultimate air and the evil souls of things; The souls of the dead, the stranglers, that perch in the trees of the wood, Waiters for all things human, haters of evil and good.” “Rua, behold me, kiss me, look in my eyes and read; Are these the eyes of a maid that would leave her lover in need?
Now cold was at many a heart, and shaking in many a seat; For there were the empty baskets, but who was to furnish the meat?
And now was the kava brewed, and now the cocoa ran, Now was the hour of the dance for child and woman and man; And mirth was in every heart, and a garland on every head, And all was well with the living and well with the eight who were dead.
for the grave breathes in the singers’ breath, And I hear in the tramp of the drums the beat of the heart of death.
“Rua, beloved, here, see what your love has brought; Coming—alas!
“Silence, heart!
There was I nourished and tended, and there was Taheia born.” Noon was high on the High-place, the second noon of the feast; And heat and shameful slumber weighed on people and priest; And the heart drudged slow in bodies heavy with monstrous meals; And the senseless limbs were scattered abroad like spokes of wheels; And crapulous women sat and stared at the stones anigh With a bestial droop of the lip and a swinish rheum in the eye.
Rua looked and wondered; he said to himself in his heart: “Poor are the pleasures of life, and death is the better part.” But lo!
Thick, like leaves in the autumn, faint, like April sleet, Missiles from tremulous hands quivered around his feet; And Taheia leaped from her place; and the priest, the ruby-eyed, Ran to the front of the terrace, and brandished his arms, and cried: “Hold, O fools, he brings tidings!” and “Hold, ’tis the love of my heart!” Till lo!
It may seem strange, when the scene is laid upon these profligate islands, to make the story hinge on love.
But love is not less known in the Marquesas than elsewhere; nor is there any cause of suicide more common in the islands.
His heart beat in his body, His hair clove to his face, When he came at last in the gloaming To the dead man’s brother’s place.
It called on all to gather From every scrog and scaur, That loved their fathers’ tartan And the ancient game of war.

weir_of_hermiston_an_unfinished_romance

It was a wonder to many that she had married--seeming so wholly of the stuff that makes old maids.
The acquaintance, which it seems profane to call a courtship, was pursued with Mr. Weir&#39;s accustomed industry, and was long a legend, or rather a source of legends, in the Parliament House.
and the profound accents of the suitor reply, &quot;Haangit, mem, haangit.&quot;
Being so trenchantly opposed to all she knew, loved, or understood, he may well have seemed to her the extreme, if scarcely the ideal, of his sex.
A little over forty at the period of his marriage, he looked already older, and to the force of manhood added the senatorial dignity of years; it was, perhaps, with an unreverend awe, but he was awful.
Perhaps half a dozen times in the history of his married life--&quot;Here!
A man who had no need either of love or of popularity, a keen reader of men and of events, there was perhaps only one truth for which he was quite unprepared: he would have been quite unprepared to learn that Kirstie hated him.
Her frosted sentiment bloomed again, she breathed deep of life, she let loose her heart, in that society.
_Persecutor_ was a word that knocked upon the woman&#39;s heart; it was her highest thought of wickedness, and the mark of it was on her house.
Perhaps none but Archie knew she could be eloquent; perhaps none but he had seen her--her colour raised, her hands clasped or quivering--glow with gentle ardour.
God was love; the name of my lord (to all who knew him) was fear.
It would break my heart to think that of you.
Kirstie took this decay of her mistress very hard; bore her a grudge, quarrelled with and railed upon her, the anxiety of a genuine love wearing the disguise of temper.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;It was a daft-like marriage.&quot;
He had nothing to explain or to conceal; he sufficed wholly and silently to himself; and that part of our nature which goes out (too often with false coin) to acquire glory or love, seemed in him to be omitted.
He did not try to be loved, he did not care to be; it is probable the very thought of it was a stranger to his mind.
Once, a court holiday falling opportunely, my lord had his carriage, and drove the child himself to Hermiston, the customary place of convalescence.
The beautiful gentleness and grace of the old judge, and the delicacy of his person, thoughts, and language, spoke to Archie&#39;s heart in its own tongue.
&quot;You and he are so different,&quot; said the boy, his eyes dwelling on those of his old friend, like a lover&#39;s on his mistress&#39;s.
He has all the Roman virtues: Cato and Brutus were such; I think a son&#39;s heart might well be proud of such an ancestry of one.&quot;
Had he but talked--talked freely--let himself gush out in words (the way youth loves to do and should), there might have been no tale to write upon the Weirs of Hermiston.
He saw Holyrood in a dream, remembrance of its romance awoke in him and faded; he had a vision of the old radiant stories, of Queen Mary and Prince Charlie, of the hooded stag, of the splendour and crime, the velvet and bright iron of the past; and dismissed them with a cry of pain.
The two handsome lads followed the same course of study and recreation, and felt a certain mutual attraction, founded mainly on good looks.
He had never dreamed this sire of his, this aboriginal antique, this adamantine Adam, had even so much of a heart as to be moved in the least degree for another--and that other himself, who had insulted him!
Let an old man say it, for once, and not need to blush: I love you like a son.&quot;
And how do you think I love my father?&quot;
I do not love my father; I wonder sometimes if I do not hate him.
How was I to love him?
God guide you in the true way, and spare your days, and preserve to you your honest heart.&quot;
At that, he kissed the young man upon the forehead in a gracious, distant, antiquated way; and instantly launched, with a marked change of voice, into another subject.
He stepped back with a heart on fire, coldly and not ungracefully excused himself, and a little after watched her dancing with young Drumanno of the empty laugh, and was harrowed at the sight, and raged to himself that this was a world in which it was given to Drumanno to please, and to himself only to stand aside and envy.
She carried her thwarted ardours into housework, she washed floors with her empty heart.
If she could not win the love of one with love, she must dominate all by her temper.
To Kirstie, thus situate and in the Indian summer of her heart, which was slow to submit to age, the gods sent this equivocal good thing of Archie&#39;s presence.
A young man who should have so doted on the idea, moral and physical, of any woman, might be properly described as being in love, head and heels, and would have behaved himself accordingly.
But Kirstie--though her heart leaped at his coming footsteps--though, when he patted her shoulder, her face brightened for the day--had not a hope or thought beyond the present moment and its perpetuation to the end of time.
I have said her heart leaped--it is the accepted phrase.
This father was twice married, once to a dark woman of the old Ellwald stock, by whom he had Gilbert, presently of Cauldstaneslap; and, secondly, to the mother of Kirstie.
&quot;He was an auld man when he married her, a fell auld man wi&#39; a muckle voice--you could hear him rowting from the top o&#39; the Kye-skairs,&quot; she said; &quot;but for her, it appears she was a perfit wonder.
But, as I was sayin&#39;, my mither--&quot; On the death of the father there remained golden-haired Kirstie, who took service with her distant kinsfolk, the Rutherfords, and black-a-vised Gilbert, twenty years older, who farmed the Cauldstaneslap, married, and begot four sons between 1773 and 1784, and a daughter, like a postscript, in &#39;97, the year of Camperdown and Cape St. Vincent.
He had never been loved, but he had been feared in honour.
He was married, and, by reason of the effulgence of that legendary night, was adored by his wife.
There was an exaltation in his nature which had led him to embrace with enthusiasm the principles of the French Revolution, and had ended by bringing him under the hawse of my Lord Hermiston in that furious onslaught of his upon the Liberals, which sent Muir and Palmer into exile and dashed the party into chaff.
The gaunt weaver was dry-nurse at Cauldstaneslap, and the bairns loved him dearly.
He too had married, and was rearing a plentiful family in the smoke and din of Glasgow; he was wealthy, and could have bought out his brother, the cock-laird, six times over, it was whispered; and when he slipped away to Cauldstaneslap for a well-earned holiday, which he did as often as he was able, he astonished the neighbours with his broadcloth, his beaver hat, and the ample plies of his neckcloth.
He loved money well enough, knew very well how to spend it, and could make a shrewd bargain when he liked.
His &quot;Hermiston Burn,&quot; with its pretty refrain-- &quot;I love to gang thinking whaur ye gang linking, Hermiston burn, in the howe;&quot; his &quot;Auld, auld Elliotts, clay-cauld Elliotts, dour, bauld Elliotts of auld,&quot; and his really fascinating piece about the Praying Weaver&#39;s Stone, had gained him in the neighbourhood the reputation, still possible in Scotland, of a local bard; and, though not printed himself, he was recognised by others who were and who had become famous.
Behind her, the whole Cauldstaneslap contingent marched in closer order, and with an indescribable air of being in the presence of the foe; and while Dandie saluted his aunt with a certain familiarity as of one who was well in court, Hob marched on in awful immobility.
He knew besides they were like other men; below the crust of custom, rapture found a way; he had heard them beat the timbrel before Bacchus--had heard them shout and carouse over their whisky-toddy; and not the most Dutch-bottomed and severe faces among them all, not even the solemn elders themselves, but were capable of singular gambols at the voice of love.
His heart perhaps beat in time to some vast indwelling rhythm of the universe.
At that her heart beat the least thing in the world; and she proceeded, by way of a corrective, to call up and dismiss a series of fancied pictures of the young man who should now, by rights, be looking at her.
she thought, and her heart swelled.
Shame bowed him down, and he looked resolutely at Mr. Torrance; who little supposed, good, worthy man, as he continued to expound justification by faith, what was his true business: to play the part of derivative to a pair of children at the old game of falling in love.
When she had overtaken the stragglers of her family, she caught up the niece whom she had so recently repulsed, and kissed and slapped her, and drove her away again, and ran after her with pretty cries and laughter.
She was in love with herself, her destiny, the air of the hills, the benediction of the sun.
Archie&#39;s image, on the other hand, when it presented itself was never welcomed--far less welcomed with any ardour, and it was exposed at times to merciless criticism.
Thus even that phenomenon of love at first sight, which is so rare and seems so simple and violent, like a disruption of life&#39;s tissue, may be decomposed into a sequence of accidents happily concurring.
&quot;Will ye no gie&#39;s a kiss, Dand?&quot;
He kissed her and considered her a moment; he found something strange in her.
That was Dandie&#39;s way; a kiss and a comfit to Jenny--a bawbee and my blessing to Jill--and goodnight to the whole clan of ye, my dears!
For the steps of love in the young, and especially in girls, are instinctive and unconscious.
He had a certain delicacy which had preserved him hitherto unspotted, and which (had either of them guessed it) made him a more dangerous companion when his heart should be really stirred.
We are here for so short a time; and all the old people before us--Rutherfords of Hermiston, Elliotts of the Cauldstaneslap--that were here but a while since riding about and keeping up a great noise in this quiet corner--making love too, and marrying--why, where are they now?
When it was done, she turned upon Archie a face softly bright, and eyes gently suffused and shining in the twilight, and his heart rose and went out to her with boundless pity and sympathy.
She was a human being tuned to a sense of the tragedy of life; there were pathos and music and a great heart in the girl.
In the falling greyness of the evening he watched her figure winding through the morass, saw it turn a last time and wave a hand, and then pass through the Slap; and it seemed to him as if something went along with her out of the deepest of his heart.
All night she seemed to be conveyed smoothly upon a shallow stream of sleep and waking, and through the bowers of Beulah; all night she cherished to her heart that exquisite hope; and if, towards morning, she forgot it a while in a more profound unconsciousness, it was to catch again the rainbow thought with her first moment of awaking.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>For Archie they had, one and all, a sensitive affection and respect which recoiled from a word of belittlement.
Frank was made welcome there at once, continued to go regularly, and had attended a meeting (as the members ever after loved to tell) on the evening before his death.
And if a man but talks of himself in the right spirit, refers to his virtuous actions by the way, and never applies to them the name of virtue, how easily his evidence is accepted in the court of public opinion!
The son of a hunks, he was still a hunks at heart, incapable of true generosity and consideration; but he had other qualities with which Frank could divert himself in the meanwhile, and to enjoy which it was necessary that Frank should keep his temper.
But with the end of the conversation, when the voice stops and the bright face of the listener is turned away, solitude falls again on the bruised heart.
For, with the clairvoyance of a genuine love, she had pierced the mystery that had so long embarrassed Frank.
Anon, with a revulsion, her temper raged to see such utmost favours of fortune and love squandered on a brat of a girl, one of her own house, using her own name--a deadly ingredient--and that &quot;didna ken her ain mind an&#39; was as black&#39;s your hat.&quot;
Now she trembled lest her deity should plead in vain, loving the idea of success for him like a triumph of nature; anon, with returning loyalty to her own family and sex, she trembled for Kirstie and the credit of the Elliotts.
And again she had a vision of herself, the day over for her old-world tales and local gossip, bidding farewell to her last link with life and brightness and love; and behind and beyond, she saw but the blank butt-end where she must crawl to die.
she, so great, so beautiful, with a heart as fresh as a girl&#39;s and strong as womanhood?
She sat up with her heart beating.
She rose, all woman, and all the best of woman, tender, pitiful, hating the wrong, loyal to her own sex--and all the weakest of that dear miscellany, nourishing, cherishing next her soft heart, voicelessly flattering, hopes that she would have died sooner than have acknowledged.
&quot;It&#39;s ill to blend the eyes of love.
He came towards her slowly from the window, took up her hand in his and kissed it.
Excuse a daft wife that loves ye, and that kenned your mither.
And for His name&#39;s sake keep yersel&#39; frae inordinate desires; haud your heart in baith your hands, carry it canny and laigh; dinna send it up like a hairn&#39;s kite into the collieshangic o&#39; the wunds!
Archie&#39;s slow pace was quickened; his legs hasted to her though his heart was hanging back.
The revulsion of feeling in Christina&#39;s heart was violent.
In her quick petulant nature, a moment ago on fire with hope, thwarted love and wounded vanity wrought.
He had passed a night of sermons, a day of reflection; he had come wound up to do his duty; and the set mouth, which in him only betrayed the effort of his will, to her seemed the expression of an averted heart.
&quot;And what kind o&#39; love do ye ca&#39; that, that&#39;s ready to gang round like a whirligig at folk talking?
It is not to be supposed that, during so many days with a love avowed between them, some reference had not been made to their conjoint future.
Kirstie had wilfully closed the eye of thought; she would not argue even with herself; gallant, desperate little heart, she had accepted the command of that supreme attraction like the call of fate and marched blindfold on her doom.
Again and again he had touched on marriage; again and again been driven back into indistinctness by a memory of Lord Hermiston.
And Kirstie had been swift to understand and quick to choke down and smother the understanding; swift to leap up in flame at a mention of that hope, which spoke volumes to her vanity and her love, that she might one day be Mrs. Weir of Hermiston; swift, also, to recognise in his stumbling or throttled utterance the death-knell of these expectations, and constant, poor girl!
But these unfinished references, these blinks in which his heart spoke, and his memory and reason rose up to silence it before the words were well uttered, gave her unqualifiable agony.
So now again, at the mere wind of its coming, at the mere mention of his father&#39;s name--who might seem indeed to have accompanied them in their whole moorland courtship, an awful figure in a wig with an ironical and bitter smile, present to guilty consciousness--she fled from it head down.
If I canna get love, I&#39;ll have respect, Mr. Weir.
It seemed unprovoked, a wilful convulsion of brute nature. . . . EDITORIAL NOTE With the words last printed, &quot;a wilful convulsion of brute nature,&quot; the romance of _Weir of Hermiston_ breaks off.
Taking advantage of the situation thus created, and of the girl&#39;s unhappiness and wounded vanity, Frank Innes pursues his purpose of seduction; and Kirstie, though still caring for Archie in her heart, allows herself to become Frank&#39;s victim.
He does not at once deny the charge, but seeks out and questions young Kirstie, who confesses the truth to him; and he, still loving her, promises to protect and defend her in her trouble.
It seems certain, however, that the next stage in the relations of Archie and the younger Kirstie would have been as above foreshadowed; and this conception of the lover&#39;s unconventional chivalry and unshaken devotion to his mistress after her fault is very characteristic of the writer&#39;s mind.
You let yourself fall in love with, and fondle, and smile at your puppets.
Again, the case of a judge involved by the exigencies of his office in a strong conflict between public duty and private interest or affection, was one which had always attracted and exercised Stevenson&#39;s imagination.
Once more, the difficulties often attending the relation of father and son in actual life had pressed heavily on Stevenson&#39;s mind and conscience from the days of his youth, when in obeying the law of his own nature he had been constrained to disappoint, distress, and for a time to be much misunderstood by, a father whom he justly loved and admired with all his heart.
The several elements above noted having been left to work for many years in his mind, it was in the autumn of 1892 that he was moved to &quot;take the lid off and look in,&quot;--under the influence, it would seem, of a special and overmastering wave of that feeling for the romance of Scottish scenery and character which was at all times so strong in him, and which his exile did so much to intensify.
With this country also holiday rides and excursions from Peebles had made him familiar as a boy: and this seems certainly the most natural scene of the story, if only from its proximity to the proper home of the Elliotts, which of course is in the heart of the Border, especially Teviotdale and Ettrick.
Surely no son of Scotland has died leaving with his last breath a worthier tribute to the land he loved.
Jo, sweetheart.
Macers, offiers of the supreme court.
Session, the Court of Session, the supreme court of Scotland.

Light be her heart, and gay her merry eyes, for years!
I suppose I’m no worse than anybody else;’ or, reckless of all moral obligations, answered boldly ‘Yes:’ and with some irritation too, as though they would add, ‘I should like to know what you see in _me_, sir, particularly, to justify suspicion!’ Notwithstanding this high tone of courage and confidence, I could not but observe that very few remained long over their wine; and that everybody had an unusual love of the open air; and that the favourite and most coveted seats were invariably those nearest to the door.
They change with the wandering fancy; assume the semblance of things left far away; put on the well-remembered aspect of favourite places dearly loved; and even people them with shadows.
This was very torturing indeed; and I don’t think I ever felt such perfect gratification and gratitude of heart, as I did when I heard from the ship’s doctor that he had been obliged to put a large mustard poultice on this very gentleman’s stomach.
To say that she is flung down on her side in the waves, with her masts dipping into them, and that, springing up again, she rolls over on the other side, until a heavy sea strikes her with the noise of a hundred great guns, and hurls her back—that she stops, and staggers, and shivers, as though stunned, and then, with a violent throbbing at her heart, darts onward like a monster goaded into madness, to be beaten down, and battered, and crushed, and leaped on by the angry sea—that thunder, lightning, hail, and rain, and wind, are all in fierce contention for the mastery—that every plank has its groan, every nail its shriek, and every drop of water in the great ocean its howling voice—is nothing.
Secondly and thirdly, an honest young Yorkshireman, connected with some American house; domiciled in that same city, and carrying thither his beautiful young wife to whom he had been married but a fortnight, and who was the fairest specimen of a comely English country girl I have ever seen.
Fourthly, fifthly, and lastly, another couple: newly married too, if one might judge from the endearments they frequently interchanged: of whom I know no more than that they were rather a mysterious, run-away kind of couple; that the lady had great personal attractions also; and that the gentleman carried more guns with him than Robinson Crusoe, wore a shooting-coat, and had two great dogs on board.
An immediate rush on deck took place of course; the sides were crowded in an instant; and for a few minutes we were in as lively a state of confusion as the greatest lover of disorder would desire to see.
It was a source of inexpressible pleasure to me to observe the almost imperceptible, but not less certain effect, wrought by this institution among the small community of Boston; and to note at every turn the humanising tastes and desires it has engendered; the affectionate friendships to which it has given rise; the amount of vanity and prejudice it has dispelled.
More spiritual and affectionate friendships appeared to exist among them, than would be found among other young persons suffering under no deprivation; but this I expected and was prepared to find.
If the company at a rout, or drawing-room at court, could only for one time be as unconscious of the eyes upon them as blind men and women are, what secrets would come out, and what a worker of hypocrisy this sight, the loss of which we so much pity, would appear to be!
The thought occurred to me as I sat down in another room, before a girl, blind, deaf, and dumb; destitute of smell; and nearly so of taste: before a fair young creature with every human faculty, and hope, and power of goodness and affection, inclosed within her delicate frame, and but one outward sense—the sense of touch.
If she could see the face of her fair instructress, she would not love her less, I am sure.
She recollected that the label _book_ was placed upon a book, and she repeated the process first from imitation, next from memory, with only the motive of love of approbation, but apparently without the intellectual perception of any relation between the things.
Presently Laura ran against her, and at once began feeling her hands, examining her dress, and trying to find out if she knew her; but not succeeding in this, she turned away as from a stranger, and the poor woman could not conceal the pang she felt, at finding that her beloved child did not know her.
‘The mother now sought to caress her, but poor Laura repelled her, preferring to be with her acquaintances.
‘After a while, on the mother taking hold of her again, a vague idea seemed to flit across Laura’s mind, that this could not be a stranger; she therefore felt her hands very eagerly, while her countenance assumed an expression of intense interest; she became very pale; and then suddenly red; hope seemed struggling with doubt and anxiety, and never were contending emotions more strongly painted upon the human face: at this moment of painful uncertainty, the mother drew her close to her side, and kissed her fondly, when at once the truth flashed upon the child, and all mistrust and anxiety disappeared from her face, as with an expression of exceeding joy she eagerly nestled to the bosom of her parent, and yielded herself to her fond embraces.
‘The subsequent parting between them, showed alike the affection, the intelligence, and the resolution of the child.
She wants to have her share, which, if not the lion’s, is the greater part; and if she does not get it, she says, “_My mother will love me_.” ‘Her tendency to imitation is so strong, that it leads her to actions which must be entirely incomprehensible to her, and which can give her no other pleasure than the gratification of an internal faculty.
‘Her social feelings, and her affections, are very strong; and when she is sitting at work, or at her studies, by the side of one of her little friends, she will break off from her task every few moments, to hug and kiss them with an earnestness and warmth that is touching to behold.
In her moral character, it is beautiful to behold her continual gladness, her keen enjoyment of existence, her expansive love, her unhesitating confidence, her sympathy with suffering, her conscientiousness, truthfulness, and hopefulness.’ Such are a few fragments from the simple but most interesting and instructive history of Laura Bridgman.
But she retained my wife’s with evident pleasure, kissed her, and examined her dress with a girl’s curiosity and interest.
‘His signs were expressive: and the strictly natural language, laughing, crying, sighing, kissing, embracing, &amp;c., was perfect.
The affection which exists between these two—the master and the pupil—is as far removed from all ordinary care and regard, as the circumstances in which it has had its growth, are apart from the common occurrences of life.
Instead of being parcelled out in great, long, rambling wards, where a certain amount of weazen life may mope, and pine, and shiver, all day long, the building is divided into separate rooms, each with its share of light and air.
And after observing that the teachers were of a class and character well suited to the spirit of the place, I took leave of the infants with a lighter heart than ever I have taken leave of pauper infants yet.
The witness is so little elevated above, or put aloof from, the crowd in the court, that a stranger entering during a pause in the proceedings would find it difficult to pick him out from the rest.
I could not but notice these differences, when I visited the courts at Boston.
In the civil court an action was trying, for damages sustained in some accident upon a railway.
I listened to him for about a quarter of an hour; and, coming out of court at the expiration of that time, without the faintest ray of enlightenment as to the merits of the case, felt as if I were at home again.
Strange as it may seem too, there is undoubtedly a degree of protection in the wig and gown—a dismissal of individual responsibility in dressing for the part—which encourages that insolent bearing and language, and that gross perversion of the office of a pleader for The Truth, so frequent in our courts of law.
That done he opened his discourse, taking for his text a passage from the Song of Solomon, laid upon the desk before the commencement of the service by some unknown member of the congregation: ‘Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on the arm of her beloved!’ He handled his text in all kinds of ways, and twisted it into all manner of shapes; but always ingeniously, and with a rude eloquence, well adapted to the comprehension of his hearers.
The house is full of boarders, both married and single, many of whom sleep upon the premises, and contract by the week for their board and lodging: the charge for which diminishes as they go nearer the sky to roost.
Supposing it confined within reasonable limits, I would always encourage this kind of pride, as a worthy element of self-respect, in any person I employed; and should no more be deterred from doing so, because some wretched female referred her fall to a love of dress, than I would allow my construction of the real intent and meaning of the Sabbath to be influenced by any warning to the well-disposed, founded on his backslidings on that particular day, which might emanate from the rather doubtful authority of a murderer in Newgate.
It is the seat of the local legislature of Connecticut, which sage body enacted, in bygone times, the renowned code of ‘Blue Laws,’ in virtue whereof, among other enlightened provisions, any citizen who could be proved to have kissed his wife on Sunday, was punishable, I believe, with the stocks.
I found the courts of law here, just the same as at Boston; the public institutions almost as good.
The old lady kissed her hand, gave another skip, smirked and sidled down the gallery in a most extraordinary manner, and ambled gracefully into her own bed-chamber.
There was another: a young man, whose madness was love and music.
Let us go down, and help them, for the love of home, and that spirit of liberty which admits of honest service to honest men, and honest work for honest bread, no matter what it be.
Why, the poor old crone is restless in a strange land, and yearns to lay her bones, she says, among her people in the old graveyard at home: and so they go to pay her passage back: and God help her and them, and every simple heart, and all who turn to the Jerusalem of their younger days, and have an altar-fire upon the cold hearth of their fathers.

One, of a female, over the door, he called ‘The Lady of the Lake.’ He smiled as I looked at these contrivances to while away the time; but when I looked from them to him, I saw that his lip trembled, and could have counted the beating of his heart.
My heart bled for him; and when the tears ran down his cheeks, and he took one of the visitors aside, to ask, with his trembling hands nervously clutching at his coat to detain him, whether there was no hope of his dismal sentence being commuted, the spectacle was really too painful to witness.
His broken heart may flutter for a moment, when he thinks of the world outside, and what it might have been to him in all those lonely years, but that is all.
It seems to me that the objection that nothing wholesome or good has ever had its growth in such unnatural solitude, and that even a dog or any of the more intelligent among beasts, would pine, and mope, and rust away, beneath its influence, would be in itself a sufficient argument against this system.
In the courts of law, the judge has his spittoon, the crier his, the witness his, and the prisoner his; while the jurymen and spectators are provided for, as so many men who in the course of nature must desire to spit incessantly.
Did I see among them, the intelligence and refinement: the true, honest, patriotic heart of America?
In one of the departments, among a collection of rare and curious articles, are deposited the presents which have been made from time to time to the American ambassadors at foreign courts by the various potentates to whom they were the accredited agents of the Republic; gifts which by the law they are not permitted to retain.
Being advised that the sensible etiquette of the republican court admitted of a traveller, like myself, declining, without any impropriety, an invitation to dinner, which did not reach me until I had concluded my arrangements for leaving Washington some days before that to which it referred, I only returned to this house once.
That these visitors, too, whatever their station, were not without some refinement of taste and appreciation of intellectual gifts, and gratitude to those men who, by the peaceful exercise of great abilities, shed new charms and associations upon the homes of their countrymen, and elevate their character in other lands, was most earnestly testified by their reception of Washington Irving, my dear friend, who had recently been appointed Minister at the court of Spain, and who was among them that night, in his new character, for the first and last time before going abroad.
Dreary and uninteresting as its aspect is, I was glad to the heart to find anything on which one of the curses of this horrible institution has fallen; and had greater pleasure in contemplating the withered ground, than the richest and most thriving cultivation in the same place could possibly have afforded me.
I left the last of them behind me in the person of a wretched drudge, who, after running to and fro all day till midnight, and moping in his stealthy winks of sleep upon the stairs betweenwhiles, was washing the dark passages at four o’clock in the morning; and went upon my way with a grateful heart that I was not doomed to live where slavery was, and had never had my senses blunted to its wrongs and horrors in a slave-rocked cradle.
Our road wound through the pleasant valley of the Susquehanna; the river, dotted with innumerable green islands, lay upon our right; and on the left, a steep ascent, craggy with broken rock, and dark with pine trees.
But the chief feature of this part of the show was a huge allegorical device, borne among the ship-carpenters, on one side whereof the steamboat Alcohol was represented bursting her boiler and exploding with a great crash, while upon the other, the good ship Temperance sailed away with a fair wind, to the heart’s content of the captain, crew, and passengers.
I was in one of the courts for a few minutes, and found it like those to which I have already referred.
He had no love for Washington; tired of towns and cities very soon; and longed for the Forest and the Prairie.
There did not appear to be much business stirring; and some unfinished buildings and improvements seemed to intimate that the city had been overbuilt in the ardour of ‘going-a-head,’ and was suffering under the re-action consequent upon such feverish forcing of its powers.
The little woman had been passing a long time with her sick mother in New York, and had left her home in St. Louis, in that condition in which ladies who truly love their lords desire to be.
The baby was born in her mother’s house; and she had not seen her husband (to whom she was now returning), for twelve months: having left him a month or two after their marriage.
[Picture: The Little Wife] Well, to be sure, there never was a little woman so full of hope, and tenderness, and love, and anxiety, as this little woman was: and all day long she wondered whether ‘He’ would be at the wharf; and whether ‘He’ had got her letter; and whether, if she sent the baby ashore by somebody else, ‘He’ would know it, meeting it in the street: which, seeing that he had never set eyes upon it in his life, was not very likely in the abstract, but was probable enough, to the young mother.
She was such an artless little creature; and was in such a sunny, beaming, hopeful state; and let out all this matter clinging close about her heart, so freely; that all the other lady passengers entered into the spirit of it as much as she; and the captain (who heard all about it from his wife) was wondrous sly, I promise you: inquiring, every time we met at table, as in forgetfulness, whether she expected anybody to meet her at St. Louis, and whether she would want to go ashore the night we reached it (but he supposed she wouldn’t), and cutting many other dry jokes of that nature.
There was one little weazen, dried-apple-faced old woman, who took occasion to doubt the constancy of husbands in such circumstances of bereavement; and there was another lady (with a lap-dog) old enough to moralize on the lightness of human affections, and yet not so old that she could help nursing the baby, now and then, or laughing with the rest, when the little woman called it by its father’s name, and asked it all manner of fantastic questions concerning him in the joy of her heart.
and such facetiousness as was displayed by the married ladies!
Belleville was a small collection of wooden houses, huddled together in the very heart of the bush and swamp.
Many of them had singularly bright doors of red and yellow; for the place had been lately visited by a travelling painter, ‘who got along,’ as I was told, ‘by eating his way.’ The criminal court was sitting, and was at that moment trying some criminals for horse-stealing: with whom it would most likely go hard: for live stock of all kinds being necessarily very much exposed in the woods, is held by the community in rather higher value than human life; and for this reason, juries generally make a point of finding all men indicted for cattle-stealing, guilty, whether or no.
His wife was a domesticated, kind-hearted old soul, who had come with him, ‘from the queen city of the world,’ which, it seemed, was Philadelphia; but had no love for this Western country, and indeed had little reason to bear it any; having seen her children, one by one, die here of fever, in the full prime and beauty of their youth.
Her heart was sore, she said, to think of them; and to talk on this theme, even to strangers, in that blighted place, so far from her old home, eased it somewhat, and became a melancholy pleasure.
As they are both very bad and the water is worse, I ask for brandy; but it is a Temperance Hotel, and spirits are not to be had for love or money.
He came outside just now, and told me how that the uncle of a certain young lady who had been spirited away and married by a certain captain, lived in these parts; and how this uncle was so valiant and ferocious that he shouldn’t wonder if he were to follow the said captain to England, ‘and shoot him down in the street wherever he found him;’ in the feasibility of which strong measure I, being for the moment rather prone to contradiction, from feeling half asleep and very tired, declined to acquiesce: assuring him that if the uncle did resort to it, or gratified any other little whim of the like nature, he would find himself one morning prematurely throttled at the Old Bailey: and that he would do well to make his will before he went, as he would certainly want it before he had been in Britain very long.
I entertained quite a curiosity in reference to this place, from having seen at Sandusky a specimen of its literature in the shape of a newspaper, which was very strong indeed upon the subject of Lord Ashburton’s recent arrival at Washington, to adjust the points in dispute between the United States Government and Great Britain: informing its readers that as America had ‘whipped’ England in her infancy, and whipped her again in her youth, so it was clearly necessary that she must whip her once again in her maturity; and pledging its credit to all True Americans, that if Mr. Webster did his duty in the approaching negotiations, and sent the English Lord home again in double quick time, they should, within two years, sing ‘Yankee Doodle in Hyde Park, and Hail Columbia in the scarlet courts of Westminster!’ I found it a pretty town, and had the satisfaction of beholding the outside of the office of the journal from which I have just quoted.
Niagara was at once stamped upon my heart, an Image of Beauty; to remain there, changeless and indelible, until its pulses cease to beat, for ever.
They were nearly all English; from Gloucestershire the greater part; and had had a long winter-passage out; but it was wonderful to see how clean the children had been kept, and how untiring in their love and self-denial all the poor parents were.
Strip from his fair young wife her silken dress and jewels, unbind her braided hair, stamp early wrinkles on her brow, pinch her pale cheek with care and much privation, array her faded form in coarsely patched attire, let there be nothing but his love to set her forth or deck her out, and you shall put it to the proof indeed.
In lieu of the endearments of childhood in its sweetest aspect, heap upon him all its pains and wants, its sicknesses and ills, its fretfulness, caprice, and querulous endurance: let its prattle be, not of engaging infant fancies, but of cold, and thirst, and hunger: and if his fatherly affection outlive all this, and he be patient, watchful, tender; careful of his children’s lives, and mindful always of their joys and sorrows; then send him back to Parliament, and Pulpit, and to Quarter Sessions, and when he hears fine talk of the depravity of those who live from hand to mouth, and labour hard to do it, let him speak up, as one who knows, and tell those holders forth that they, by parallel with such a class, should be High Angels in their daily lives, and lay but humble siege to Heaven at last.
Looking round upon these people: far from home, houseless, indigent, wandering, weary with travel and hard living: and seeing how patiently they nursed and tended their young children: how they consulted ever their wants first, then half supplied their own; what gentle ministers of hope and faith the women were; how the men profited by their example; and how very, very seldom even a moment’s petulance or harsh complaint broke out among them: I felt a stronger love and honour of my kind come glowing on my heart, and wished to God there had been many Atheists in the better part of human nature there, to read this simple lesson in the book of Life.
These people are called Shakers from their peculiar form of adoration, which consists of a dance, performed by the men and women of all ages, who arrange themselves for that purpose in opposite parties: the men first divesting themselves of their hats and coats, which they gravely hang against the wall before they begin; and tying a ribbon round their shirt-sleeves, as though they were going to be bled.
I so abhor, and from my soul detest that bad spirit, no matter by what class or sect it may be entertained, which would strip life of its healthful graces, rob youth of its innocent pleasures, pluck from maturity and age their pleasant ornaments, and make existence but a narrow path towards the grave: that odious spirit which, if it could have had full scope and sway upon the earth, must have blasted and made barren the imaginations of the greatest men, and left them, in their power of raising up enduring images before their fellow-creatures yet unborn, no better than the beasts: that, in these very broad-brimmed hats and very sombre coats—in stiff-necked, solemn-visaged piety, in short, no matter what its garb, whether it have cropped hair as in a Shaker village, or long nails as in a Hindoo temple—I recognise the worst among the enemies of Heaven and Earth, who turn the water at the marriage feasts of this poor world, not into wine, but gall.
And if there must be people vowed to crush the harmless fancies and the love of innocent delights and gaieties, which are a part of human nature: as much a part of it as any other love or hope that is our common portion: let them, for me, stand openly revealed among the ribald and licentious; the very idiots know that _they_ are not on the Immortal road, and will despise them, and avoid them readily.
Some nautical authority had told me a day or two previous, ‘anything with west in it, will do;’ so when I darted out of bed at daylight, and throwing up the window, was saluted by a lively breeze from the north-west which had sprung up in the night, it came upon me so freshly, rustling with so many happy associations, that I conceived upon the spot a special regard for all airs blowing from that quarter of the compass, which I shall cherish, I dare say, until my own wind has breathed its last frail puff, and withdrawn itself for ever from the mortal calendar.
Others had sold their clothes to raise the passage-money, and had hardly rags to cover them; others had no food, and lived upon the charity of the rest: and one man, it was discovered nearly at the end of the voyage, not before—for he kept his secret close, and did not court compassion—had had no sustenance whatever but the bones and scraps of fat he took from the plates used in the after-cabin dinner, when they were put out to be washed.
As she plunged into a foaming valley, how I loved to see the green waves, bordered deep with white, come rushing on astern, to buoy her upward at their pleasure, and curl about her as she stooped again, but always own her for their haughty mistress still!
While thus living, a daughter was born to them, who grew up in the same liberty, until she married a free negro, and went with him to reside in Pennsylvania.
Has a considerable scar across his breast and each arm, made by a knife; loves to talk much of the goodness of God.’ ‘Twenty-five dollars reward for my man Isaac.
They are, by nature, frank, brave, cordial, hospitable, and affectionate.
Cultivation and refinement seem but to enhance their warmth of heart and ardent enthusiasm; and it is the possession of these latter qualities in a most remarkable degree, which renders an educated American one of the most endearing and most generous of friends.
That’s how our people come to be suspicious.’ Another prominent feature is the love of ‘smart’ dealing: which gilds over many a swindle and gross breach of trust; many a defalcation, public and private; and enables many a knave to hold his head up with the best, who well deserves a halter; though it has not been without its retributive operation, for this smartness has done more in a few years to impair the public credit, and to cripple the public resources, than dull honesty, however rash, could have effected in a century.
He is a public nuisance, is he not?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘A convicted liar?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘He has been kicked, and cuffed, and caned?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘And he is utterly dishonourable, debased, and profligate?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘In the name of wonder, then, what is his merit?’ ‘Well, sir, he is a smart man.’ In like manner, all kinds of deficient and impolitic usages are referred to the national love of trade; though, oddly enough, it would be a weighty charge against a foreigner that he regarded the Americans as a trading people.
The love of trade is assigned as a reason for that comfortless custom, so very prevalent in country towns, of married persons living in hotels, having no fireside of their own, and seldom meeting from early morning until late at night, but at the hasty public meals.
The love of trade is a reason why the literature of America is to remain for ever unprotected ‘For we are a trading people, and don’t care for poetry:’ though we _do_, by the way, profess to be very proud of our poets: while healthful amusements, cheerful means of recreation, and wholesome fancies, must fade before the stern utilitarian joys of trade.
When any man, of any grade of desert in intellect or character, can climb to any public distinction, no matter what, in America, without first grovelling down upon the earth, and bending the knee before this monster of depravity; when any private excellence is safe from its attacks; when any social confidence is left unbroken by it, or any tie of social decency and honour is held in the least regard; when any man in that free country has freedom of opinion, and presumes to think for himself, and speak for himself, without humble reference to a censorship which, for its rampant ignorance and base dishonesty, he utterly loathes and despises in his heart; when those who most acutely feel its infamy and the reproach it casts upon the nation, and who most denounce it to each other, dare to set their heels upon, and crush it openly, in the sight of all men: then, I will believe that its influence is lessening, and men are returning to their manly senses.
{206} It would be well, there can be no doubt, for the American people as a whole, if they loved the Real less, and the Ideal somewhat more.
It would be well, if there were greater encouragement to lightness of heart and gaiety, and a wider cultivation of what is beautiful, without being eminently and directly useful.
I have little reason to believe, from certain warnings I have had since I returned to England, that it will be tenderly or favourably received by the American people; and as I have written the Truth in relation to the mass of those who form their judgments and express their opinions, it will be seen that I have no desire to court, by any adventitious means, the popular applause.
And this I will do and cause to be done, not in mere love and thankfulness, but because I regard it as an act of plain justice and honour.’ I said these words with the greatest earnestness that I could lay upon them, and I repeat them in print here with equal earnestness.

Upon its surface of bronze were elaborately wrought, in the still exquisite workmanship of Greece, reliefs of the Olympian games; the two horses that drew the car were of the rarest breed of Parthia; their slender limbs seemed to disdain the ground and court the air, and yet at the slightest touch of the charioteer, who stood behind the young owner of the equipage, they paused motionless, as if suddenly transformed into stone--lifeless, but lifelike, as one of the breathing wonders of Praxiteles.
&#39;Pleasure is too stately and ponderous in those mighty walls: even in the precincts of the court--even in the Golden House of Nero, and the incipient glories of the palace of Titus, there is a certain dulness of magnificence--the eye aches--the spirit is wearied; besides, my Clodius, we are discontented when we compare the enormous luxury and wealth of others with the mediocrity of our own state.
I prefer it to Baiae: I grant the charms of the latter, but I love not the pedants who resort there, and who seem to weigh out their pleasures by the drachm.&#39;
The puppy saw nothing incongruous in learning at the same time a ditty of love and a description of the plague.&#39;
elevated the heart.
Oh, can these men love, my Clodius?
How rarely a Roman has a heart!
On their lips her sweet kiss lingers yet, And their cheeks with her tender tears are wet.
For she weeps--that gentle mother weeps-- (As morn and night her watch she keeps, With a yearning heart and a passionate care) To see the young things grow so fair; She weeps--for love she weeps; And the dews are the tears she weeps From the well of a mother&#39;s love!
Ye have a world of light, Where love in the loved rejoices; But the blind girl&#39;s home is the House of Night, And its beings are empty voices.
And I thirst the loved forms to see, And I stretch my fond arms around, And I catch but a shapeless sound, For the living are ghosts to me.
&#39;Nay,&#39; returned Clodius, &#39;all women are the same at heart.
&#39;With all my heart,&#39; said Clodius; &#39;and the bay, too, is always the most animated part of the city.&#39;
Clodius, shading his eyes from the burning sky, was calculating the gains of the last week; and the Greek, leaning upon his hand, and shrinking not from that sun--his nation&#39;s tutelary deity--with whose fluent light of poesy, and joy, and love, his own veins were filled, gazed upon the broad expanse, and envied, perhaps, every wind that bent its pinions towards the shores of Greece.
&#39;Tell me, Clodius,&#39; said the Greek at last, &#39;hast thou ever been in love?&#39;
&#39;He who has loved often,&#39; answered Glaucus, &#39;has loved never.
&#39;I adore even the shadow of Love; but I adore himself yet more.&#39;
&#39;Art thou, then, soberly and honestly in love?
&#39;I am not far gone enough for that,&#39; returned Glaucus, smiling, &#39;or rather I say with Tibullus-- He whom love rules, where&#39;er his path may be, Walks safe and sacred.
In fact, I am not in love; but I could be if there were but occasion to see the object.
She adores you, and does not affect to conceal it; and, by Hercules, I say again and again, she is both handsome and rich.
Several months ago I was sojourning at Neapolis, a city utterly to my own heart, for it still retains the manners and stamp of its Grecian origin--and it yet merits the name of Parthenope, from its delicious air and its beautiful shores.
The recollections of Athens crowded fast and meltingly upon me: imagining myself still alone in the temple, and absorbed in the earnestness of my devotion, my prayer gushed from my heart to my lips, and I wept as I prayed.
I guessed at once that she was also of Athenian lineage; and that in my prayer for Athens her heart had responded to mine.
At the sound of my voice she blushed, and half drew her veil across her face.--&quot;My forefathers&#39; ashes,&quot; said she, &quot;repose by the waters of Ilissus: my birth is of Neapolis; but my heart, as my lineage, is Athenian.&quot;
We, strangers from a far and fallen land, stood together and alone in that temple of our country&#39;s deity: was it not natural that my heart should yearn to my countrywoman, for so I might surely call her?
I do not love; but I remember and regret.&#39;
But not in such jaded bosoms can Nature awaken that enthusiasm which alone draws from her chaste reserve all her unspeakable beauty: she demands from you, not the exhaustion of passion, but all that fervor, from which you only seek, in adoring her, a release.
&#39;Thy heart rebukes thee while thou speakest,&#39; said the Egyptian; &#39;and in thy gaieties this night, thou wilt be more mindful of Leoena than of Lais.
said Glaucus, musingly; &#39;yet dead though he seem to pleasure, and cold to the objects of the world, scandal belies him, or his house and his heart could tell a different tale.&#39;
HEAVEN had given to Glaucus every blessing but one: it had given him beauty, health, fortune, genius, illustrious descent, a heart of fire, a mind of poetry; but it had denied him the heritage of freedom.
Succeeding early to an ample inheritance, he had indulged that inclination for travel so natural to the young, and had drunk deep of the intoxicating draught of pleasure amidst the gorgeous luxuries of the imperial court.
Passionately enamoured of poetry and the drama, which recalled to Glaucus the wit and the heroism of his race, that fairy mansion was adorned with representations of AEschylus and Homer.
From each of the seven columns that adorned this court hung festoons of garlands: the centre, supplying the place of a garden, bloomed with the rarest flowers placed in vases of white marble, that were supported on pedestals.
How they do love to see a good tough battle between a man and a lion; and all this innocent pleasure they may lose (if the gods don&#39;t send us a good criminal soon) from this cursed law!&#39;
Sallust was only twenty-four, but he had no pleasure in life like eating--perhaps he had exhausted all the others: yet had he some talent, and an excellent heart--as far as it went.
cried Glaucus, as his favorite slave crowned his streaming locks with a new chaplet, &#39;I love these wild spectacles well enough when beast fights beast; but when a man, one with bones and blood like ours, is coldly put on the arena, and torn limb from limb, the interest is too horrid: I sicken--I gasp for breath--I long to rush and defend him.
See, the dice court us.&#39;
&#39;You are too generous, Glaucus,&#39; said the gamester, handing the cup to his slave; &#39;but your love gives it a double value.&#39;
From the hush&#39;d, low-breathing skies, Half-shut look&#39;d their starry eyes, And all around, With a loving sound, The AEgean waves were creeping: On her lap lay the lynx&#39;s head; Wild thyme was her bridal bed; And aye through each tiny space, In the green vine&#39;s green embrace The Fauns were slily peeping-- The Fauns, the prying Fauns-- The arch, the laughing Fauns-- The Fauns were slily peeping!
Fastly we fleet, then seize our wings, And plunge us deep in the sparkling springs; And aye, as we rise with a dripping plume, We&#39;ll scatter the spray round the garland&#39;s bloom; We glow--we glow, Behold, as the girls of the Eastern wave Bore once with a shout to the crystal cave The prize of the Mysian Hylas, Even so--even so, We have caught the young god in our warm embrace We hurry him on in our laughing race; We hurry him on, with a whoop and song, The cloudy rivers of night along-- Ho, ho!--we have caught thee, Psilas!
&#39;It is, indeed, a great contrast,&#39; said Clodius, ironically at heart, though not in appearance, &#39;to the old-fashioned and tame simplicity of that ode of Horace which we heard before.
She has all Pompeii at her feet, and she has no lovers: she will not even marry.&#39;
The vestibule blazed with rows of lamps; curtains of embroidered purple hung on either aperture of the tablinum, whose walls and mosaic pavement glowed with the richest colors of the artist; and under the portico which surrounded the odorous viridarium they found Ione, already surrounded by adoring and applauding guests!
As Arbaces now arrived at the rails which separated the profane from the sacred place, a crowd, composed of all classes, but especially of the commercial, collected, breathless and reverential, before the many altars which rose in the open court.
But the building contained many other deities to grace the court of the Egyptian deity: her kindred and many-titled Bacchus, and the Cyprian Venus, a Grecian disguise for herself, rising from her bath, and the dog-headed Anubis, and the ox Apis, and various Egyptian idols of uncouth form and unknown appellations.
Here they seated themselves before a small table spread with dishes containing fruit and eggs, and various cold meats, with vases of excellent wine, of which while the companions partook, a curtain, drawn across the entrance opening to the court, concealed them from view, but admonished them by the thinness of the partition to speak low, or to speak no secrets: they chose the former alternative.
As you feed the victim for the slaughter, I love to rear the votaries of my pleasure.
I love to train, to ripen their minds--to unfold the sweet blossom of their hidden passions, in order to prepare the fruit to my taste.
I loathe your ready-made and ripened courtesans; it is in the soft and unconscious progress of innocence to desire that I find the true charm of love; it is thus that I defy satiety; and by contemplating the freshness of others, I sustain the freshness of my own sensations.
Next to woman, I love the old recollections of my ancestral land; I love to keep alive--to propagate on distant shores (which her colonies perchance yet people) her dark and mystic creeds.
Thou knowest already I intend her for my queen--my bride--my heart&#39;s Isis.
Never till I saw her knew I all the love of which my nature is capable.&#39;
&#39;No; she loves me--but as a friend--she loves me with her mind only.
&#39;But Sappho without love!
I loved to steep her amidst the dissipations and luxury of this abandoned city.
I wished her to be surrounded by lovers, hollow, vain, and frivolous (lovers that her nature must despise), in order to feel the want of love.
Then, in those soft intervals of lassitude that succeed to excitement--I can weave my spells--excite her interest--attract her passions--possess myself of her heart.
Her Greek soul despises the barbarian Romans, and would scorn itself if it admitted a thought of love for one of that upstart race.&#39;
She is more silent than she used to be; she loves melancholy and subduing music; she sighs without an outward cause.
This may be the beginning of love--it may be the want of love.
In either case it is time for me to begin my operations on her fancies and her heart: in the one case, to divert the source of love to me; in the other, in me to awaken it.
Our arts--the arts by which Egypt trained her young novitiates--must be employed; and, under veil of the mysteries of religion, I will open to her the secrets of love.&#39;
Merrily the sunbeams played to and fro on the tessellated floor and the brilliant walls--far more happily came the rays of joy to the heart of the young Glaucus.
Longer, perhaps, had been the enamoured soliloquy of Glaucus, but at that moment a shadow darkened the threshold of the chamber, and a young female, still half a child in years, broke upon his solitude.
It was a proof how much a single evening had sufficed to increase and to refine the love of the Athenian for Ione, that whereas he had confided to Clodius the secret of his first interview with her, and the effect it had produced on him, he now felt an invincible aversion even to mention to him her name.
They who could not understand her soul were made spiritual, as it were, by the magic of her beauty--they who had no heart for poetry had ears, at least, for the melody of her voice.
This feeling who has not experienced?--If thou hast not, then thou hast never loved.
Clodius scarcely regretted it, for he was anxious that Glaucus should marry an heiress yet more richly endowed--Julia, the daughter of the wealthy Diomed, whose gold the gamester imagined he could readily divert into his own coffers.
She soon turned from the more gaudy streets, and entered a quarter of the town but little loved by the decorous and the sober.
They spoke of Greece; this was a theme on which Ione loved rather to listen than to converse: it was a theme on which the Greek could have been eloquent for ever.
Was it a sin to love her countryman?
she loved Athens in him--the gods of her race, the land of her dreams, spoke to her in his voice!
Their love was sudden, but it was strong; it filled all the sources of their life.
As you take some obstacle from two objects that have a mutual attraction, they met, and united at once; their wonder was, that they had lived separate so long.
And it was natural that they should so love.
They imagined the heavens smiled upon their affection.
As the persecuted seek refuge at the shrine, so they recognized in the altar of their love an asylum from the sorrows of earth; they covered it with flowers--they knew not of the serpents that lay coiled behind.
Perhaps in the intenseness of his zeal, he found in the severity of that peculiar priesthood its peculiar attraction.&#39;
He loves genius.&#39;
My heart inclines readily to most of my kind.
A sudden and unaccountable gloom came over each as they thus gazed; and in that sympathy which love had already taught them, and which bade them, in the slightest shadows of emotion, the faintest presentiment of evil, turn for refuge to each other, their gaze at the same moment left the mountain, and full of unimaginable tenderness, met.
What need had they of words to say they loved?
Meanwhile, Arbaces had not of late much frequented the house of Ione; and when he had visited her he had not encountered Glaucus, nor knew he, as yet, of that love which had so suddenly sprung up between himself and his designs.
&quot;None among mortals hath ever lifted up my veil,&quot; so saith the Isis that you adore; but to the wise that veil hath been removed, and we have stood face to face with the solemn loveliness of Nature.
Arbaces, pausing for a moment, gazed on the pair with a brow from which all the usual stern serenity had fled; he recovered himself by an effort, and slowly approached them, but with a step so soft and echoless, that even the attendants heard him not; much less Ione and her lover.
&#39;And yet,&#39; said Glaucus, &#39;it is only before we love that we imagine that our poets have truly described the passion; the instant the sun rises, all the stars that had shone in his absence vanish into air.
The poets exist only in the night of the heart; they are nothing to us when we feel the full glory of the god.&#39;
She feared lest her enthusiasm had led her too far; yet she feared the austere Arbaces less than the courteous Glaucus, for she loved the last, and it was not the custom of the Greeks to allow their women (at least such of their women as they most honored) the same liberty and the same station as those of Italy enjoyed.
She felt, therefore, a thrill of delight as Glaucus earnestly replied: &#39;Ever mayst thou think thus, Ione--ever be your pure heart your unerring guide!
Know, my Ione, that it was but yesterday that Glaucus boasted openly--yes, in the public baths--of your love to him.
But he laughed scornfully when his Clodius, or his Lepidus, asked him if he loved you enough for marriage, and when he purposed to adorn his door-posts with flowers?&#39;
These insults only wound when they come from one we love; far different indeed is he whom the lofty Ione shall stoop to love.&#39;
It is not without interest to observe in those remote times, and under a social system so widely different from the modern, the same small causes that ruffle and interrupt the &#39;course of love&#39;, which operate so commonly at this day--the same inventive jealousy, the same cunning slander, the same crafty and fabricated retailings of petty gossip, which so often now suffice to break the ties of the truest love, and counteract the tenor of circumstances most apparently propitious.
When the bark sails on over the smoothest wave, the fable tells us of the diminutive fish that can cling to the keel and arrest its progress: so is it ever with the great passions of mankind; and we should paint life but ill if, even in times the most prodigal of romance, and of the romance of which we most largely avail ourselves, we did not also describe the mechanism of those trivial and household springs of mischief which we see every day at work in our chambers and at our hearths.
In the interview with which he had just been blessed, he had for the first time gathered from her distinctly that his love was not unwelcome to, and would not be unrewarded by, her.
&#39;The rose is the token of silence,&#39; replied Sallust, &#39;but I love only to see it at the supper-table.&#39;
the poor Pompeians are very civil--they love to honour merit.
&#39;O backward of heart!&#39;
If He seem to you too sublime, two shadowy, for those human associations, those touching connections between Creator and creature, to which the weak heart clings--contemplate Him in His Son, who put on mortality like ourselves.
God works in your heart.
He felt it as a profanation to break upon that enchanted strain--the susceptibility of his excited nature, the Greek softness and ardour of his secret soul, were swayed and captured by surprise.
He sank on the seat with parted lips and thirsting ear; while in a chorus of voices, bland and melting as those which waked Psyche in the halls of love, rose the following song: THE HYMN OF EROS By the cool banks where soft Cephisus flows, A voice sail&#39;d trembling down the waves of air; The leaves blushed brighter in the Teian&#39;s rose, The doves couch&#39;d breathless in their summer lair; While from their hands the purple flowerets fell, The laughing Hours stood listening in the sky;-- From Pan&#39;s green cave to AEgle&#39;s haunted cell, Heaved the charm&#39;d earth in one delicious sigh.
Eldest of all the gods, with Chaos born; My smile sheds light along the courts above, My kisses wake the eyelids of the Morn.
Love, sons of earth--for love is earth&#39;s soft lore, Look where ye will--earth overflows with ME; Learn from the waves that ever kiss the shore, And the winds nestling on the heaving sea.
&#39;All teaches love!&#39;

As he spoke, a group of nymphs surrounded the statue; they laid chaplets on its pedestal, and, while the cups were emptied and refilled at that glowing board, they sang the following strain: BACCHIC HYMNS TO THE IMAGE OF DEATH I Thou art in the land of the shadowy Host, Thou that didst drink and love: By the Solemn River, a gliding ghost, But thy thought is ours above!
By the ruin&#39;d hall these flowers we lay, Where thy soul once held its palace; When the rose to thy scent and sight was gay, And the smile was in the chalice, And the cithara&#39;s voice Could bid thy heart rejoice When night eclipsed the day.
If youth&#39;s the cup we yet can quaff, Be love the pearl within it!
And far from the dreary tomb Speed the wings of the rosy Hours-- Sweet is for thee the bowl, Sweet are thy looks, my love; I fly to thy tender soul, As bird to its mated dove!
And tell me with words and sighs, But more with thy melting eyes, That my sun is not set-- That the Torch is not quench&#39;d at the Urn That we love, and we breathe, and burn, Tell me--thou lov&#39;st me yet!
&#39;Come here,&#39; said Stratonice, drawing her husband to her affectionately by the ears, in that caress which Tibullus has so prettily described--&#39;Come here!&#39;
I love, my boy, one jolly hour with thee, and one of the plain, unsophisticated, laughing girls that I meet in this chamber, all smoke-dried though it be, better than whole nights of those magnificent debauches.&#39;
&#39;With all my heart,&#39; said the priest, rubbing his hands, and drawing himself nearer to the table.
exclaimed the flower-girl, in a tone almost of transport; the tears stood arrested on her cheek; she smiled, she clung to his breast, she kissed his robe as she clung.
a brother cupman, a quiet dog, who does not love these snarlings,&#39; said Burbo, carelessly.
He held her on his knees--he wiped the blood from her shoulders with his long hair--he kissed the tears from her cheeks--he whispered to her a thousand of those soothing words with which we calm the grief of a child--and so beautiful did he seem in his gentle and consoling task, that even the fierce heart of Stratonice was touched.
She was peculiarly formed, then, to command and fascinate the less ordinary and the bolder natures of men; to love her was to unite two passions, that of love and of ambition--you aspired when you adored her.
Set apart himself from the common world, he loved that daringness of character which also made itself, among common things, aloof and alone.
If it was not strange that Ione thus enthralled the Egyptian, far less strange was it that she had captured, as suddenly as irrevocably, the bright and sunny heart of the Athenian.
His imagination dazzled him, but his heart never was corrupted.
Ambition in the regions of a despotic and luxurious court was but the contest of flattery and craft.
But in large states, the city is but the court: the provinces--unknown to you, unfamiliar in customs, perhaps in language--have no claim on your patriotism, the ancestry of their inhabitants is not yours.
In the court you desire favor instead of glory; at a distance from the court, public opinion has vanished from you, and self-interest has no counterpoise.
But dream not of freedom for the whole while you enslave the parts; the heart must be the centre of the system, the blood must circulate freely everywhere; and in vast communities you behold but a bloated and feeble giant, whose brain is imbecile, whose limbs are dead, and who pays in disease and weakness the penalty of transcending the natural proportions of health and vigour.
And tell me if there ever, even in the ages most favorable to glory, could be a triumph more exalted and elating than the conquest of one noble heart?
If natural to love her, it was natural that she should return the passion.
Young, brilliant, eloquent, enamoured, and Athenian, he was to her as the incarnation of the poetry of her father&#39;s land.
They were not like creatures of a world in which strife and sorrow are the elements; they were like things to be seen only in the holiday of nature, so glorious and so fresh were their youth, their beauty, and their love.
She felt it a reproach upon her character and her career, a punishment above all to her love; she felt, for the first time, how suddenly she had yielded to that love; she blushed with shame at a weakness, the extent of which she was startled to perceive: she imagined it was that weakness which had incurred the contempt of Glaucus; she endured the bitterest curse of noble natures--humiliation!
Yet her love, perhaps, was no less alarmed than her pride.
If one moment she murmured reproaches upon Glaucus--if one moment she renounced, she almost hated him--at the next she burst into passionate tears, her heart yielded to its softness, and she said in the bitterness of anguish, &#39;He despises me--he does not love me.&#39;
He was troubled, but his hopes were not dimmed, for he knew already that he loved and was beloved; what more could he desire as an amulet against fear?
At deepest night, then, when the streets were hushed, and the high moon only beheld his devotions, he stole to that temple of his heart--her home; and wooed her after the beautiful fashion of his country.
While she listened, she believed nothing against her lover; but when they were stilled at last, and his step departed, the spell ceased; and, in the bitterness of her soul, she almost conceived in that delicate flattery a new affront.
With all the independence of Ione&#39;s character, his heart had enabled him to obtain a secret and powerful control over her mind.
Utterly unaware of his real character or his hidden love, she felt for him the reverence which genius feels for wisdom, and virtue for sanctity.
She did not love him, but she feared.
That yearning and intense desire for the knowledge which is not of earth--which had burned from his boyhood in the heart of the priest--was dazzled, until it confused and mastered his clearer sense.
He knew that by dwelling much upon the fault of a rival, you only give him dignity in the eyes of your mistress: the wisest plan is, neither loudly to hate, nor bitterly to contemn; the wisest plan is to lower him by an indifference of tone, as if you could not dream that he could be loved.
Blinded alike by the pride of Ione, and, perhaps, by his own, he dreamed not that she already loved; but he dreaded lest she might have formed for Glaucus the first fluttering prepossessions that lead to love.
&#39;There is a love, beautiful Greek, which is not the love only of the thoughtless and the young--there is a love which sees not with the eyes, which hears not with the ears; but in which soul is enamoured of soul.
The countryman of thy ancestors, the cave-nursed Plato, dreamed of such a love--his followers have sought to imitate it; but it is a love that is not for the herd to echo--it is a love that only high and noble natures can conceive--it hath nothing in common with the sympathies and ties of coarse affection--wrinkles do not revolt it--homeliness of feature does not deter; it asks youth, it is true, but it asks it only in the freshness of the emotions; it asks beauty, it is true, but it is the beauty of the thought and of the spirit.
Such is the love, O Ione, which is a worthy offering to thee from the cold and the austere.
Austere and cold thou deemest me--such is the love that I venture to lay upon thy shrine--thou canst receive it without a blush.&#39;
no, that is an affection of earth, of vulgar habits and sordid sympathies; the feeling of which I speak is borrowed from the stars&#39;--it partakes of that mystic and ineffable yearning, which we feel when we gaze on them--it burns, yet it purifies--it is the lamp of naphtha in the alabaster vase, glowing with fragrant odorous, but shining only through the purest vessels.
No; it is not love, and it is not friendship, that Arbaces feels for Ione.
She thought that he, in truth, spoke only of the affection and sympathy of the soul; but was it not precisely that affection and that sympathy which had made a part of those emotions she felt for Glaucus; and could any other footstep than his approach the haunted adytum of her heart?
But he, Ione, he came to me his anxieties and his distress; he sought one who pitied me and loved him; I have calmed his mind--I have removed his doubts--I have taken him from the threshold of Wisdom into its temple; and before the majesty of the goddess his soul is hushed and soothed.
The next evening was fixed for the visit; and the Egyptian, with a serene countenance, and a heart beating with fierce and unholy joy, departed.
It covered itself with its shell--as the saint in his piety--as the sage in his wisdom--as the lover in his hope.
For this animal the mercurial and vivid Greek felt all the wonder and affection of contrast.
Did thy parents love, or didst thou?
Wert thou capable of affection?
Ione, couldst thou dream how I adore thee!&#39;
From these enamoured reveries, Glaucus was interrupted by the entrance of Nydia.
Nydia, I love her!&#39;
&#39;I love, and thou shalt tell her so.
She will be a sister to thy youth--she will appreciate thy winning talents--she will love thy simple graces as none other could, for they are like her own.
&#39;That is my own Nydia,&#39; continued Glaucus, kissing her hand.
But if my heart whispers truly, I shall claim thee again soon, my child.
I am distracted with doubts and fears; learn--for thou art quick, and thy care for me will sharpen tenfold thy acuteness--learn the cause of this unkindness; speak of me as often as thou canst; let my name come ever to thy lips: insinuate how I love rather than proclaim it; watch if she sighs whilst thou speakest, if she answer thee; or, if she reproves, in what accents she reproves.
&#39;May the gods bless this grateful heart!&#39;
said Glaucus, greatly moved; and, unconscious of the fires he excited, he repeatedly kissed her forehead.
And now, my heart tears itself from thee, and the only sound it utters bids me--die!&#39;
Base is that heart which does not respect affliction!
and the heart of Ione beat quick.
I meant not so soon to say I loved.
But those words rush to my heart--they will have way.
adored Ione!
They take from the sun the odorous they return--they are the emblem of the love that receives and repays tenfold--the emblem of the heart that drunk thy rays, and owes to thee the germ of the treasures that it proffers to thy smile.
She thinks, Ione, that thou wilt love her: if thou dost not, send her back to me.
What had been the supposed offence of Glaucus?--that he had not really loved!
And now, plainly, and in no dubious terms, he confessed that love.
At every tender word in that letter, so full of romantic and trustful passion, her heart smote her.
and had she not, at least, allowed to him the culprit&#39;s right to know his crime, to plead in his defence?--the tears rolled down her cheeks--she kissed the letter--she placed it in her bosom: and, turning to Nydia, who stood in the same place and in the same posture: &#39;Wilt thou sit, my child,&#39; said she, &#39;while I write an answer to this letter?&#39;
common rashness, common timidity of love!)
The sadness mingled with dignity with which Nydia uttered these simple words, affected the beautiful Ione: she bent down and kissed her.
The Thessalian kissed the hand of Ione, and then said, with some embarrassment: &#39;One favor, fair Ione--may I dare to ask it?&#39;
Glaucus then loved her; he owned it--yes, he loved her.
She drew forth again that dear confession; she paused over every word, she kissed every line; she did not ask why he had been maligned, she only felt assured that he had been so.
The enamoured Greek would not let Nydia escape him, though she sought several times to leave the chamber; he made her recite to him over and over again every syllable of the brief conversation that had taken place between her and Ione; a thousand times, forgetting her misfortune, he questioned her of the looks, of the countenance of his beloved; and then quickly again excusing his fault, he bade her recommence the whole recital which he had thus interrupted.
ye gods, yet Glaucus loves her?&#39;
Fool that I am--shall I save her?--yes, for I love Glaucus better than myself.&#39;
&#39;Knowest thou,&#39; said she, &#39;if Ione has any relative, any intimate friend at Pompeii?&#39;
Verily, the stars flatter when they give me a type in this fool of war--when they promise to the ardour of my wisdom the same results as to the madness of his ambition--perpetual exercise--no certain goal!--the Sisyphus task, the mountain and the stone!--the stone, a gloomy image!--it reminds me that I am threatened with somewhat of the same death as the Epirote.
From the heart of the torpid city, so soon to vibrate with a thousand passions, there came no sound: the streams of life circulated not; they lay locked under the ice of sleep.
His dark imagination loved to exercise itself in those more visionary and obscure researches which are ever the most delightful to a wayward and solitary mind, and to which he himself was invited by the daring pride of his disposition and the mysterious traditions of his clime.
But in rejecting an ambition that coveted nominal distinctions, he but indulged the more in the ambition to rule the heart.
Honoring mental power as the greatest of earthly gifts, he loved to feel that power palpably in himself, by extending it over all whom he encountered.
He loved to find subjects in men&#39;s souls--to rule over an invisible and immaterial empire!--had he been less sensual and less wealthy, he might have sought to become the founder of a new religion.
Besides, however, the vague love of this moral sway (vanity so dear to sages!)
He loved to keep alive the worship of Egypt, because he thus maintained the shadow and the recollection of her power.
Rome herself was hateful to his indignant soul; nor did he love to find his riches rivalled by the minions of the court, and cast into comparative poverty by the mighty magnificence of the court itself.
He was removed from the sight of a superior wealth; he was without rivals to his riches; he was free from the spies of a jealous court.
It is the curse of sensualists never to love till the pleasures of sense begin to pall; their ardent youth is frittered away in countless desires--their hearts are exhausted.
So, ever chasing love, and taught by a restless imagination to exaggerate, perhaps, its charms, the Egyptian had spent all the glory of his years without attaining the object of his desires.
When, two years before the present date, he beheld Ione, he saw, for the first time, one whom he imagined he could love.
With an earnestness and a patience which he had never before commanded for his pleasures, Arbaces had devoted himself to win the heart of Ione.
It did not content him to love, he desired to be loved.
In this hope he had watched the expanding youth of the beautiful Neapolitan; and, knowing the influence that the mind possesses over those who are taught to cultivate the mind, he had contributed willingly to form the genius and enlighten the intellect of Ione, in the hope that she would be thus able to appreciate what he felt would be his best claim to her affection: viz, a character which, however criminal and perverted, was rich in its original elements of strength and grandeur.
When he felt that character to be acknowledged, he willingly allowed, nay, encouraged her, to mix among the idle votaries of pleasure, in the belief that her soul, fitted for higher commune, would miss the companionship of his own, and that, in comparison with others, she would learn to love herself.
Nothing kindles the fire of love like the sprinkling of the anxieties of jealousy; it takes then a wilder, a more resistless flame; it forgets its softness; it ceases to be tender; it assumes something of the intensity--of the ferocity--of hate.
Arbaces resolved to lose no further time upon cautious and perilous preparations: he resolved to place an irrevocable barrier between himself and his rivals: he resolved to possess himself of the person of Ione: not that in his present love, so long nursed and fed by hopes purer than those of passion alone, he would have been contented with that mere possession.
He desired the heart, the soul, no less than the beauty, of Ione; but he imagined that once separated by a daring crime from the rest of mankind--once bound to Ione by a tie that memory could not break, she would be driven to concentrate her thoughts in him--that his arts would complete his conquest, and that, according to the true moral of the Roman and the Sabine, the empire obtained by force would be cemented by gentler means.
There was something so frank and charming in the manner of Ione, as she thus spoke, that the Egyptian was more than ever enamoured, and more than ever disposed to renew the offence he had committed; he, however, answered quickly and gaily, and hastened to renew the conversation.
I have myself looked upon thy future lot, and the ghosts of thy Future bask in the gardens of Elysium: amidst the asphodel and the rose they prepare the garlands of thy sweet destiny, and the Fates, so harsh to others, weave only for thee the web of happiness and love.
Again the heart of Ione murmured &#39;Glaucus&#39;; she uttered a half-audible assent; the Egyptian rose, and taking her by the hand, he led her across the banquet-room--the curtains withdrew as by magic hands, and the music broke forth in a louder and gladder strain; they passed a row of columns, on either side of which fountains cast aloft their fragrant waters; they descended by broad and easy steps into a garden.
The Neapolitan&#39;s heart beat violently.
said he, passionately gazing upon her, &#39;listen to one who has long struggled vainly with his love.
I adore thee!
Never woman had lover so devoted--so passionate as I will be to Ione.
Dark is my soul when thy face is hid from it: shine over me, my sun--my heaven--my daylight!--Ione, Ione--do not reject my love!&#39;
&#39;I love another!&#39;
Arbaces came nearer to her--his breath glowed fiercely on her cheek; he wound his arms round her--she sprang from his embrace.
As he spoke, he caught Ione in his arms; and, in that ferocious grasp, was all the energy--less of love than of revenge.
As at Paris at this day, so at that time in the cities of Italy, men lived almost wholly out of doors: the public buildings, the forum, the porticoes, the baths, the temples themselves, might be considered their real homes; it was no wonder that they decorated so gorgeously these favorite places of resort--they felt for them a sort of domestic affection as well as a public pride.
Around the court ran a regular and symmetrical colonnade of Doric architecture; and there several, whose business drew them early to the place, were taking the slight morning repast which made an Italian breakfast, talking vehemently on the earthquake of the preceding night as they dipped pieces of bread in their cups of diluted wine.
His dress was remarkably plain--not so much from its material, as from the absence of all those ornaments which were worn by the Pompeians of every rank--partly from the love of show, partly, also, because they were chiefly wrought into those shapes deemed most efficacious in resisting the assaults of magic and the influence of the evil eye.
echoed the priest, in so hollow a tone that it went at once to the heart of the Nazarene.
Every now and then he exchanged a significant glance, a slight sign, with some passenger, whose garb usually betokened the wearer to belong to the humbler classes; for Christianity was in this the type of all other and less mighty revolutions--the grain of mustard-seed was in the heart of the lowly.
I forgot,&#39; continued Ione, &#39;I should come to thee&#39;; and she moved along the benches till she reached the place where Nydia sat, and flinging her arms caressingly round her, covered her cheeks with kisses.
Nydia was that morning paler than her wont, and her countenance grew even more wan and colorless as she submitted to the embrace of the beautiful Neapolitan.
&#39;Until last night (when a necromantic prodigy did indeed appal me), methinks I was not credulous in any other magic save that of love!&#39;
&#39;Play to us, dear Nydia, said Glaucus--&#39;play and give us one of thine old Thessalian songs: whether it be of magic or not, as thou wilt--let it, at least, be of love!&#39;
&#39;Of love!&#39;
&#39;Will you that I should sing of love?&#39;
She moved a little way from the arm of Ione, still cast round her, as if that soft embrace embarrassed; and placing her light and graceful instrument on her knee, after a short prelude, she sang the following strain: NYDIA&#39;S LOVE-SONG I The Wind and the Beam loved the Rose, And the Rose loved one; For who recks the wind where it blows?
Or loves not the sun?
how canst thou prove That bright love of thine?
In thy light is the proof of thy love.
IV How its love can the Wind reveal?
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Ione and Glaucus, occupied with each other, perceived not those signs of strange and premature emotions, which preyed upon a heart that, nourished by imagination, dispensed with hope.
Clime that yet enervates with a soft and Circean spell--that moulds us insensibly, mysteriously, into harmony with thyself, banishing the thought of austerer labor, the voices of wild ambition, the contests and the roar of life; filling us with gentle and subduing dreams, making necessary to our nature that which is its least earthly portion, so that the very air inspires us with the yearning and thirst of love.
Here, if God meant this working-day life for a perpetual holiday, who would not sigh to dwell for ever--asking nothing, hoping nothing, fearing nothing, while thy skies shine over him--while thy seas sparkle at his feet--while thine air brought him sweet messages from the violet and the orange--and while the heart, resigned to--beating with--but one emotion, could find the lips and the eyes, which flatter it (vanity of vanities!)
that love can defy custom, and be eternal?
It was then in this clime--on those seas, that the Athenian gazed upon a face that might have suited the nymph, the spirit of the place: feeding his eyes on the changeful roses of that softest cheek, happy beyond the happiness of common life, loving, and knowing himself beloved.
We love to feel within us the bond which unites the most distant era--men, nations, customs perish; THE AFFECTIONS ARE IMMORTAL!--they are the sympathies which unite the ceaseless generations.
The magician&#39;s gift, that revives the dead--that animates the dust of forgotten graves, is not in the author&#39;s skill--it is in the heart of the reader!
THE SONG OF GLAUCUS I As the bark floateth on o&#39;er the summer-lit sea, Floats my heart o&#39;er the deeps of its passion for thee; All lost in the space, without terror it glides, For bright with thy soul is the face of the tides.
II The bark may go down, should the cloud sweep above, For its being is bound to the light of thy love.
sweeter to sink while the sky is serene, If time hath a change for thy heart!
As the last words of the song trembled over the sea, Ione raised her looks--they met those of her lover.
&#39;Thou art full of the romance of thy native Thessaly,&#39; said Glaucus; &#39;and a strange mixture of sense and all conflicting superstitions.&#39;
Thus conversing, they wore away the hours; the lovers, conscious only of the brightness and smiles of love; the blind girl feeling only its darkness--its tortures--the fierceness of jealousy and its woe!
&#39;Thou seest, my child,&#39; cried Glaucus, &#39;that I can yet redeem the character of love&#39;s music, and that I was wrong in saying happiness could not be gay.
And over the Cyprian Isle The skies shed their silent smile; And the Forest&#39;s green heart was rife With the stir of the gushing life-- The life that had leap&#39;d to birth, In the veins of the happy earth!
III And thou, my beloved one--thou, As I gaze on thy soft eyes now, Methinks from their depths I view The Holy Birth born anew; Thy lids are the gentle cell Where the young Love blushing lies; See!
has thy heart found contentment under these priestly robes?
&#39;Come,&#39; said the Nazarene, as he perceived the effect he had produced, &#39;come to the humble hall in which we meet--a select and a chosen few; listen there to our prayers; note the sincerity of our repentant tears; mingle in our simple sacrifice--not of victims, nor of garlands, but offered by white-robed thoughts upon the altar of the heart.
There seemed to Apaecides, so naturally pure of heart, something ineffably generous and benign in that spirit of conversation which animated Olinthus--a spirit that found its own bliss in the happiness of others--that sought in its wide sociality to make companions for eternity.
And then these bold and fervent men, nursed in vicissitude, beaten by the rough winds of life--men of mailed and impervious fortitude, ready to affront a world, prepared for torment and armed for death--men, who presented all imaginable contrast to the weak nerves, the light hearts, the tender fragility of childhood, crowded round the infants, smoothing their rugged brows and composing their bearded lips to kindly and fostering smiles: and then the old man opened the scroll and he taught the infants to repeat after him that beautiful prayer which we still dedicate to the Lord, and still teach to our children; and then he told them, in simple phrase, of God&#39;s love to the young, and how not a sparrow falls but His eye sees it.
And the stern paternal penitent seemed to feel in the innocence of his children a return into early life--life ere yet it sinned: he followed the motion of their young lips with an earnest gaze; he smiled as they repeated, with hushed and reverent looks, the holy words: and when the lesson was done, and they ran, released, and gladly to his knee, he clasped them to his breast, kissed them again and again, and tears flowed fast down his cheek--tears, of which it would have been impossible to trace the source, so mingled they were with joy and sorrow, penitence and hope--remorse for himself and love for them!
At his presence, the whole congregation rose; there was an expression of deep, affectionate respect upon every countenance; and Apaecides, gazing on his countenance, felt attracted towards him by an irresistible sympathy.
No man ever looked upon that face without love; for there had dwelt the smile of the Deity, the incarnation of divinest love--and the glory of the smile had never passed away.
The children were on either side of the convert; his heart was theirs--he had become as one of them--to enter into the kingdom of Heaven.
DAYS are like years in the love of the young, when no bar, no obstacle, is between their hearts--when the sun shines, and the course runs smooth--when their love is prosperous and confessed.
Ione no longer concealed from Glaucus the attachment she felt for him, and their talk now was only of their love.
Perhaps they loved each other the more because the condition of the world left to Glaucus no aim and no wish but love; because the distractions common in free states to men&#39;s affections existed not for the Athenian; because his country wooed him not to the bustle of civil life; because ambition furnished no counterpoise to love: and, therefore, over their schemes and projects, love only reigned.
In the iron age they imagined themselves of the golden, doomed only to live and to love.
For the oak without fruit or blossom, whose hard and rugged heart is fitted for the storm, there is less fear than for the delicate branches of the myrtle, and the laughing clusters of the vine.
They had now advanced far into August--the next month their marriage was fixed, and the threshold of Glaucus was already wreathed with garlands; and nightly, by the door of Ione, he poured forth the rich libations.
They felt an interest in her, perhaps the greater and more affectionate from the very strangeness and waywardness of her nature, her singular alternations of passion and softness--the mixture of ignorance and genius--of delicacy and rudeness--of the quick humors of the child, and the proud calmness of the woman.
But her chief delight was still in visiting the few feet of ground which made the garden of Glaucus--in tending the flowers that at least repaid her love.
Often she bitterly repented the service she had rendered to Ione: often she said inly, &#39;If she had fallen, Glaucus could have loved her no longer&#39;; and then dark and fearful thoughts crept into her breast.
The shock that crushed her heart with the tidings that Glaucus loved, had at first only saddened and benumbed--by degrees jealousy took a wilder and fiercer shape; it partook of hatred--it whispered revenge.
As you see the wind only agitate the green leaf upon the bough, while the leaf which has lain withered and seared on the ground, bruised and trampled upon till the sap and life are gone, is suddenly whirled aloft--now here--now there--without stay and without rest; so the love which visits the happy and the hopeful hath but freshness on its wings!
But the heart that hath fallen from the green things of life, that is without hope, that hath no summer in its fibres, is torn and whirled by the same wind that but caresses its brethren--it hath no bough to cling to--it is dashed from path to path--till the winds fall, and it is crushed into the mire for ever.
As darkness, too, favors the imagination, so, perhaps, her very blindness contributed to feed with wild and delirious visions the love of the unfortunate girl.
The voice of Glaucus had been the first that had sounded musically to her ear; his kindness made a deep impression upon her mind; when he had left Pompeii in the former year, she had treasured up in her heart every word he had uttered; and when any one told her that this friend and patron of the poor flower-girl was the most brilliant and the most graceful of the young revellers of Pompeii, she had felt a pleasing pride in nursing his recollection.
If any of my readers ever loved at an age which they would now smile to remember--an age in which fancy forestalled the reason, let them say whether that love, among all its strange and complicated delicacies, was not, above all other and later passions, susceptible of jealousy?
When Glaucus returned to Pompeii, Nydia had told another year of life; that year, with its sorrows, its loneliness, its trials, had greatly developed her mind and heart; and when the Athenian drew her unconsciously to his breast, deeming her still in soul as in years a child--when he kissed her smooth cheek, and wound his arm round her trembling frame, Nydia felt suddenly, and as by revelation, that those feelings she had long and innocently cherished were of love.
Doomed to be rescued from tyranny by Glaucus--doomed to take shelter under his roof--doomed to breathe, but for so brief a time, the same air--and doomed, in the first rush of a thousand happy, grateful, delicious sentiments of an overflowing heart, to hear that he loved another; to be commissioned to that other, the messenger, the minister; to feel all at once that utter nothingness which she was--which she ever must be, but which, till then, her young mind had not taught her--that utter nothingness to him who was all to her; what wonder that, in her wild and passionate soul, all the elements jarred discordant; that if love reigned over the whole, it was not the love which is born of the more sacred and soft emotions?
Her feelings to Ione ebbed and flowed with every hour; now she loved her because he did; now she hated him for the same cause.
Glaucus did not attempt to follow, or to soothe; he was offended; he continued to examine the jewels and to comment on their fashion--to object to this and to praise that, and finally to be talked by the merchant into buying all; the safest plan for a lover, and a plan that any one will do right to adopt, provided always that he can obtain an Ione!
He spent the forenoon with his beautiful Neapolitan, repaired thence to the baths, supped (if, as we have said before, we can justly so translate the three o&#39;clock coena of the Romans) alone, and abroad, for Pompeii had its restaurateurs--and returning home to change his dress ere he again repaired to the house of Ione, he passed the peristyle, but with the absorbed reverie and absent eyes of a man in love, and did not note the form of the poor blind girl, bending exactly in the same place where he had left her.
&#39;My dear Nydia,&#39; returned Glaucus, and raising her, he kissed her forehead, &#39;think of it no more!
&#39;It is true,&#39; said Nydia, &#39;I must learn to govern myself I must bide, I must suppress, my heart.
&#39;Thy affectionate heart will be thy best guide, Nydia, when thou hast learned to regulate its feelings.&#39;
Can you conceal, can you even regulate, your love for Ione?&#39;
&#39;And ever favored, my Nydia, be it by those who have the soul of poetry: it is the flower of love, of festival; it is also the flower we dedicate to silence and to death; it blooms on our brows in life, while life be worth the having; it is scattered above our sepulchre when we are no more.&#39;
&#39;It might not be so, Nydia, were it not for love!
&#39;As ashes cannot be rekindled--as love once dead can never revive, so freedom departed from a people is never regained.
and methinks, had I yet lingered on those shores, had I been a Grecian maid whose happy fate it was to love and to be loved, I myself could have armed my lover for another Marathon, a new Plataea.
And still in the saddening Mart, The pulse of that mighty heart, Whose very blood was glory!
Glaucopis forsakes her own, The angry gods forget us; But yet, the blue streams along, Walk the feet of the silver Song; And the night-bird wakes the moon; And the bees in the blushing noon Haunt the heart of the old Hymettus.
We are fallen, but not forlorn, If something is left to cherish; As Love was the earliest born, So Love is the last to perish.
They tell me of earlier hours; And I hear the heart of my Country breathe From the lips of the Stranger&#39;s flowers.
&#39;Ione,&#39; said Apaecides, drawing her towards him, and regarding her tenderly, &#39;can I think that this beautiful form, this kind heart, may be destined to an eternity of torment?&#39;
Ione flew to them in joy; he kissed her earnestly, and then he said: &#39;Farewell, my sister!
when we next meet, thou mayst be to me as nothing; take thou, then, this embrace--full yet of all the tender reminiscences of childhood, when faith and hope, creeds, customs, interests, objects, were the same to us.
They shuddered at the blessing of love, to their ears it was uttered in a demon&#39;s name.
My father was amongst a mighty crowd that gathered on one of our immemorial hills to hear this sage of the East expound: through the wide throng there rang not a single murmur!--the jest and the roar, with which our native orators are received, were hushed for him--and when on the loftiest summit of that hill, raised above the breathless crowd below, stood this mysterious visitor, his mien and his countenance awed every heart, even before a sound left his lips.
&#39;When he thus spoke, the long-pent murmur went forth, and the philosophers that were mingled with the people, muttered their sage contempt; there might you have seen the chilling frown of the Stoic, and the Cynic&#39;s sneer; and the Epicurean, who believeth not even in our own Elysium, muttered a pleasant jest, and swept laughing through the crowd: but the deep heart of the people was touched and thrilled; and they trembled, though they knew not why, for verily the stranger had the voice and majesty of a man to whom &quot;The Unknown God&quot; had committed the preaching of His faith.&#39;
His heart was with his son; he did not see the figure that now approached from the gate with a quick step, and a somewhat fierce and reckless gait and carriage.
&#39;Generous, affectionate, pious as are thy motives,&#39; said Medon, when they were thus secured from observation, &#39;thy deed itself is guilt: thou art to risk thy blood for thy father&#39;s freedom--that might be forgiven; but the prize of victory is the blood of another.
Beasts, whose very lips drop blood; things, all savage, unprincipled in their very courage: ferocious, heartless, senseless; no tie of life can bind them: they know not fear, it is true--but neither know they gratitude, nor charity, nor love; they are made but for their own career, to slaughter without pity, to die without dread!
His heart!--who, in our happier age, can even imagine its struggles--its commotion?
In their porticoes and gardens they courted the sun whenever it so pleased their luxurious tastes.
The fair Julia regarded herself with a last gaze of complacent vanity, and reclining again upon her seat, she bade the youngest of her slaves, in a listless tone, read to her the enamoured couplets of Tibullus.
Blind girl, I love, and--shall Julia live to say it?--am loved not in return!
&#39;But tell me--thou hearest the gossip of slaves, always prone to these dim beliefs; always ready to apply to sorcery for their own low loves--hast thou ever heard of any Eastern magician in this city, who possesses the art of which thou art ignorant?
&#39;They say he is a man above all the petty and false impostures of dull pretenders--that he is versed in the learning of the stars, and the secrets of the ancient Nox; why not in the mysteries of love?&#39;
If to these orgies love be admitted--why the more likely that he knows its secrets!&#39;
&#39;At daylight, and in his present state, thou hast assuredly the less to fear,&#39; answered Nydia, yielding to her own sudden and secret wish to learn if the dark Egyptian were indeed possessed of those spells to rivet and attract love, of which the Thessalian had so often heard.
&#39;I cannot take thy present,&#39; said Nydia, putting aside the bracelet; &#39;but young as I am, I can sympathize unbought with those who love--and love in vain.&#39;
First, then, of all my pleasures, even before that of love, shall come revenge!
his heart beat quick.
&#39;Admit her,&#39; said the Egyptian: for a moment his vain heart dreamed the stranger might be Ione.
said Julia, a little cheered by the accustomed accents of adulation; &#39;does not sorrow fly to wisdom for relief, and they who love unrequitedly, are not they the chosen victims of grief?&#39;
said Arbaces, &#39;can unrequited love be the lot of so fair a form, whose modelled proportions are visible even beneath the folds of thy graceful robe?
&#39;Thou comest to me for advice in unhappy love,&#39; said he; &#39;well, turn that face on the ungrateful one: what other love-charm can I give thee?&#39;
&#39;And, being unblest with fortune, wouldst thou allure some wealthy suitor?&#39;
And thou lovest him who loves not thee?&#39;
&#39;I know not if I love him,&#39; answered Julia, haughtily; &#39;but I know that I would see myself triumph over a rival--I would see him who rejected me my suitor--I would see her whom he has preferred in her turn despised.&#39;
&#39;Yet more, fair maiden; wilt thou confide to me the name of thy lover?
Her art can bring thy lover to thy feet.
I dare not trust to mere strangers to guide me; the reputation of women of my rank is easily tarnished--and though I care not who knows that I love Glaucus, I would not have it imagined that I obtained his love by a spell.&#39;
replied Arbaces; and Julia, half frightened at this unhallowed appointment, but urged on by jealousy and the pique of rivalship, even more than love, resolved to fulfill it.
Left alone, Arbaces burst forth: &#39;Bright stars that never lie, ye already begin the execution of your promises--success in love, and victory over foes, for the rest of my smooth existence.
With what a kindly equal love she pours her blessings upon her children!
There is no tongue that flatters like a lover&#39;s; and yet, in the exaggeration of his feelings, flattery seems to him commonplace.
They arrived at the ruins; they examined them with that fondness with which we trace the hallowed and household vestiges of our own ancestry--they lingered there till Hesperus appeared in the rosy heavens; and then returning homeward in the twilight, they were more silent than they had been; for in the shadow and beneath the stars they felt more oppressively their mutual love.
&#39;Are ye married?&#39;
The heart of Ione stood still at that strange mirth.
&#39;Yet, poor woman, thou knowest little of love, or thou wouldst know that it never changes.&#39;
Such as is the form, so is the heart.&#39;
&#39;I am the witch of the mountain,&#39; replied the sorceress, with a ghastly grin; &#39;my trade is to give hope to the hopeless: for the crossed in love I have philtres; for the avaricious, promises of treasure; for the malicious, potions of revenge; for the happy and the good, I have only what life has--curses!
The young, the all-beautiful Ione, seated by that rude fire--her lover already forgetful of the presence of the hag, at her feet, gazing upward to her face, and whispering sweet words--the pale and affrighted slave at a little distance--and the ghastly hag resting her deadly eyes upon them; yet seemingly serene and fearless (for the companionship of love hath such power) were these beautiful beings, things of another sphere, in that dark and unholy cavern, with its gloomy quaintness of appurtenance.
&#39;Thou hast,&#39; said she, in a slow and steady voice--which belied the expression of her face, so much was it passionless and calm--&#39;thou hast had shelter under my roof, and warmth at my hearth; thou hast returned evil for good; thou hast smitten and haply slain the thing that loved me and was mine: nay, more, the creature, above all others, consecrated to gods and deemed venerable by man,--now hear thy punishment.
May thy love be blasted--may thy name be blackened--may the infernals mark thee--may thy heart wither and scorch--may thy last hour recall to thee the prophet voice of the Saga of Vesuvius!
&#39;I have done,&#39; replied the hag, laughing wildly; &#39;for in thy doom is she who loves thee accursed.
Borne by those of his trustier slaves in whom in all more secret expeditions he was accustomed to confide, he lay extended along his litter, and resigning his sanguine heart to the contemplation of vengeance gratified and love possessed.
Let the lover breathe his vows to the Shades.&#39;
I loved, I fancied myself beloved.&#39;
&#39;And what connection hath thy love, witch, with my commands?&#39;
I loved!
My mother was herself a saga: she shared the resentment of her child; from her hands I received the potion that was to restore me his love; and from her, also, the poison that was to destroy my rival.
my trembling hands mistook the phials, my lover fell indeed at my feet; but dead!
&#39;But these emotions are fit only for our youth--age should harden our hearts to all things but ourselves; as every year adds a scale to the shell-fish, so should each year wall and incrust the heart.
&#39;But,&#39; continued the witch, &#39;if instead of that which shall arrest the heart, I give that which shall sear and blast the brain--which shall make him who quaffs it unfit for the uses and career of life--an abject, raving, benighted thing--smiting sense to drivelling youth to dotage--will not thy vengeance be equally sated--thy object equally attained?&#39;
So saying, he cast upon the floor a heavy purse, which clinked not unmusically to the ear of the hag, who loved the consciousness of possessing the means to purchase comforts she disdained.
&#39;I love to look at you,&#39; said she, apostrophising the moneys; &#39;for when I see you I feel that I am indeed of power.
&#39;He called me dotard,&#39; said she, as the smoke curled from the hissing cauldron: &#39;when the jaws drop, and the grinders fall, and the heart scarce beats, it is a pitiable thing to dote; but when,&#39; she added, with a savage and exulting grin, &#39;the young, and the beautiful, and the strong, are suddenly smitten into idiocy--ah, that is terrible!
By Dian, I never saw lover more courteous than that same magician!
She therefore dissuaded her no more: but nursed in her excited heart the wild and increasing desire to know if sorcery had indeed a spell to fascinate love to love.
&#39;The gods bless thy grateful heart!
His spirits entirely recovered from the effect of the past night, his locks waving in the wind, his joyous and elastic heart bounding with every spring of his Parthian steeds, a very prototype of his country&#39;s god, full of youth and of love--Glaucus was borne rapidly to his mistress.
&#39;Why, I had once hoped that Glaucus would have married her.
&#39;The witch loves not many visitors at once,&#39; said he: &#39;leave Nydia here till your return; she can be of no assistance to us: and, for protection--your own beauty suffices--your own beauty and your own rank; yes, Julia, I know thy name and birth.
She thought of her own desolate fate, far from her native land, far from the bland cares that once assuaged the April sorrows of childhood--deprived of the light of day, with none but strangers to guide her steps, accursed by the one soft feeling of her heart, loving and without hope, save the dim and unholy ray which shot across her mind, as her Thessalian fancies questioned of the force of spells and the gifts of magic.
Nature had sown in the heart of this poor girl the seeds of virtue never destined to ripen.
Her sense of right and wrong was confused by a passion to which she had so madly surrendered herself; and the same intense and tragic emotions which we read of in the women of the classic age--a Myrrha, a Medea--and which hurried and swept away the whole soul when once delivered to love--ruled, and rioted in, her breast.
I told thee, girl, at first, that it was not the Athenian whom I loved: but I see now that I may trust thee wholly--it is the beautiful Greek!&#39;
Her heart swelled almost to suffocation--she gasped for breath--in the darkness of the vehicle, Julia did not perceive the agitation of her companion; she went on rapidly dilating on the promised effect of her acquisition, and on her approaching triumph over Ione, every now and then abruptly digressing to the horror of the scene she had quitted--the unmoved mien of Arbaces, and his authority over the dreadful Saga.
Nydia&#39;s heart beat violently.
&#39;Glaucus,&#39; she murmured, &#39;all the love-charms of the wildest magic could not make thee love me as I love thee.
The sectarian sternness which confined virtue and heaven to a chosen few, which saw demons in other gods, and the penalties of hell in other religions--made the believer naturally anxious to convert all to whom he felt the ties of human affection; and the circle thus traced by benevolence to man was yet more widened by a desire for the glory of God.

Nature had already gifted me with the love of pleasure, and the desire of gain and power.
Our language of affection is so woven with that of worship, that the words grow chilled and trite if I banish from them allusion to our gods.&#39;
As I thus lay my temples on thy bosom, as I thus feel thy gentle arm embrace me, I think that we are children once more, and that the heaven smiles equally upon both.
if hereafter I escape, no matter what peril; and it be permitted me to address thee on one sacred and awful subject; should I find thine ear closed and thy heart hardened, what hope for myself could countervail the despair for thee?
Wondering and bewildered by words she could not comprehend, but excited even to tears by the plaintiveness of their tone, Ione listened to these outpourings of a full and oppressed heart.
For as there is no chimera vainer than the hope that one human heart shall find sympathy in another, so none ever interpret us with justice; and none, no, not our nearest and our dearest ties, forbear with us in mercy!
Ione beckoned to a slave that stood in the portico, and sending for her lute, sang, when it arrived, to a tender and simple air, the following verses:-- REGRETS FOR CHILDHOOD I It is not that our earlier Heaven Escapes its April showers, Or that to childhood&#39;s heart is given No snake amidst the flowers.
Thou art to be wedded to Glaucus: perchance that marriage may separate us more hopelessly--but not of this speak I now--thou art to be married to Glaucus--dost thou love him?
I have heard that when women really love, it is to that excess.&#39;
There is no sacrifice to those who love, in what is borne for the one we love.&#39;
He turned to meet the eyes of Ione--earnest, wistful, fearful--he kissed her fondly, strained her warmly to his breast, and in a moment more he had left the house.
Still, however, he had a considerable degree of learning, wit, and good nature; and the hearty frankness of his very vices seemed like virtue itself beside the utter corruption of Clodius and the prostrate effeminacy of Lepidus; and therefore Glaucus liked him the best of his companions; and he, in turn, appreciating the nobler qualities of the Athenian, loved him almost as much as a cold muraena, or a bowl of the best Falernian.
In the centre of the peristyle was an open court, which contained the impluvium.
After performing the salutation, which was usually accomplished by the same cordial shake of the right hand which we ourselves retain, and sometimes, by the yet more familiar embrace, they spent several minutes in surveying the apartment, and admiring the bronzes, the pictures, or the furniture, with which it was adorned--a mode very impolite according to our refined English notions, which place good breeding in indifference.
&#39;You evade my question,&#39; returned the enamoured Julia.
&#39;So the men say; but then she is rich: she is to marry the Athenian--I wish her joy.
&#39;We love a warrior,&#39; said the wife of Pansa.
&#39;Yes; Mars himself was in love with the mother of jokes,&#39; said the poet, a little alarmed.
He addressed her across the table in set phrases of gallantry; and as he was of high birth and of a showy person, the vain Julia was not so much in love as to be insensible to his attentions.
through these flowers our music sends its greeting To your loved halls, where Psilas shuns the day; When the young god his Cretan nymph was meeting He taught Pan&#39;s rustic pipe this gliding lay: Soft as the dews of wine Shed in this banquet hour, The rich libation of Sound&#39;s stream divine, O reverent harp, to Aphrodite pour!
Steal, my lull&#39;d music, steal Like womans&#39;s half-heard tone, So that whoe&#39;er shall hear, shall think to feel In thee the voice of lips that love his own.
It is a Greek fashion: Diomed loves the Greeks--I love the Greeks--you love the Greeks--we all love the Greeks--and between you and me this is not the only thing we have stolen from them.
My Lesbia--ah, for shame, love Methinks &#39;tis scarce an hour ago When we did just the same, love.
A kiss: ah!
Lesbia, would that thrones were mine, And crowns to deck that brow, love!
And yet I know that heart of thine For me is throne enow, love!
said she, looking down, &#39;I see that you really love Ione--she is indeed beautiful.&#39;
&#39;Yes, I love Ione; amidst all the youth who court you, may you have one worshipper as sincere.&#39;
It was so much the custom for persons about to be married to receive these gifts, that Glaucus could have little scruple in accepting the necklace, though the gallant and proud Athenian inly resolved to requite the gift by one of thrice its value.
In the far Judea, and in the city of Nain, there dwelt a widow, humble of spirit and sad of heart; for of all the ties of life one son alone was spared to her.
And she loved him with a melancholy love, for he was the likeness of the lost.
The mother, who followed the bier, wept--not noisily, but all who looked upon her saw that her heart was crushed.
&#39;Till that time,&#39; renewed the widow&#39;s son, &#39;I had been as other men: thoughtless, not abandoned; taking no heed, but of the things of love and life; nay, I had inclined to the gloomy faith of the earthly Sadducee!
As the lamp shines, so life glitters for an hour; but the soul&#39;s light is the star that burns for ever, in the heart of inimitable space.&#39;
But the whole heart of that divine old man was bathed in love; the smile of the Deity had burned away from it the leaven of earthlier and coarser passions, and left to the energy of the hero all the meekness of the child.
He hears the winds murmur glad tidings; the woods sleep in the shadow of Almighty wings--the stars are the Scriptures of Heaven, the tokens of love, and the witnesses of immortality.
It was then, in that fearful burning mood, her heart beating, her cheek flushing, that Nydia awaited the possibility of Glaucus&#39;s return before the night.
She breathed quick--&#39;I will prepare for you myself,&#39; said she, &#39;the summer draught that Ione loves--of honey and weak wine cooled in snow.&#39;
&#39;If Ione love it, enough; it would be grateful were it poison.&#39;
What would not Nydia have given then for one hour&#39;s prerogative of sight, to have watched her hopes ripening to effect--to have seen the first dawn of the imagined love--to have worshipped with more than Persian adoration the rising of that sun which her credulous soul believed was to break upon her dreary night!
What petty pique, what small revenge, what expectation of a paltry triumph, had swelled the attributes of that sentiment she dignified with the name of love!
but in the wild heart of the Thessalian all was pure, uncontrolled, unmodified passion--erring, unwomanly, frenzied, but debased by no elements of a more sordid feeling.
Filled with love as with life itself, how could she resist the occasion of winning love in return!
As he spoke, he put down the cup and rose from his seat to approach her, when a sudden pang shot coldly to his heart, and was followed by a wild, confused, dizzy sensation at the brain.
Nay, I will atone the insult--I ask thy sister in marriage--start not--consider--what is the alliance of yon holiday Greek compared to mine?
His love, his repute, nay, his very life, might be in danger--the day and hour seemed even to have been fixed for some design against him.
Apaecides fell to the ground pierced to the heart--he fell mute, without even a groan, at the very base of the sacred chapel.
They raised the body, and great was their horror and sacred indignation to discover in that lifeless clay a priest of the adored and venerable Isis; but still greater, perhaps, was their surprise, when they found the accused in the brilliant and admired Athenian.
Glaucus was to have married the priest&#39;s sister.&#39;
&#39;If,&#39; thought he, &#39;Glaucus feed the lion, Julia will no longer have a person to love better than me; she will certainly doat on me--and so, I suppose, I must marry.
Better marry, then, while I may, renounce gaming, and push my fortune (or rather the gentle Julia&#39;s) at the imperial court.&#39;
Thou knowest thou wert walking with the priest, disputing about his sister; thou knowest he was intolerant, and half a Nazarene, and he sought to convert thee, and ye had hot words; and he calumniated thy mode of life, and swore he would not marry Ione to thee--and then, in thy wrath and thy frenzy, thou didst strike the sudden blow.
I the murderer of Ione&#39;s brother: I confess to have injured one hair of the head of him she loved!
It seems but a little day since life laughed out from amidst roses--Ione mine--youth, health, love, lavishing on me their treasures; and now--pain, madness, shame, death!
who will belie himself to shame, and stand blackened in the eyes of love?
That first violent anguish which blunts the sense to all but itself, and the forbearing silence of her slaves, had prevented her learning minutely the circumstances attendant on the fate of her lover.
it was not for her to perform that tender and touching office, which obliged the nearest relative to endeavor to catch the last breath--the parting soul--of the beloved one: but it was hers to close the straining eyes, the distorted lips: to watch by the consecrated clay, as, fresh bathed and anointed, it lay in festive robes upon the ivory bed; to strew the couch with leaves and flowers, and to renew the solemn cypress-branch at the threshold of the door.
It was among the loveliest customs of the ancients to bury the young at the morning twilight; for, as they strove to give the softest interpretation to death, so they poetically imagined that Aurora, who loved the young, had stolen them to her embrace; and though in the instance of the murdered priest this fable could not appropriately cheat the fancy, the general custom was still preserved.
Raised in the form of an altar--of unpolished pine, amidst whose interstices were placed preparations of combustible matter--stood the funeral pyre; and around it drooped the dark and gloomy cypresses so consecrated by song to the tomb.
With fond and trembling hands, she unclosed the lids of the deceased; but when the dull glazed eye, no longer beaming with love and life, met hers, she shrieked aloud, as if she had seen a spectre.
Once more recovering herself she kissed again and again the lids, the lips, the brow; and with mechanic and unconscious hand, received from the high priest of her brother&#39;s temple the funeral torch.
o&#39;er the sluggard tide Of the Styx thy bark can glide, And thy steps evermore shall rove Through the glades of the happy grove; Where, far from the loath&#39;d Cocytus, The loved and the lost invite us.
Thy tomb is the faithful heart.
About evermore we bear thee; For who from the heart can tear thee?
If love may in life be brief, In death it is fixed for ever.
Not--as we have before said--attaching even a momentary belief to the unnatural accusation, but nursing the darkest suspicion against Arbaces, she felt that justice to her lover and to her murdered relative demanded her to seek the praetor, and communicate her impression, unsupported as it might be.
At another time the Egyptian might have conceived a philosophical interest in sounding the depths and origin of the strange and absorbing passion which, in blindness and in slavery, this singular girl had dared to cherish; but at present he spared no thought from himself.
For if, when he judged her merely the accomplice of Julia in obtaining the philtre, he had felt it was dangerous to the full success of his vengeance to allow her to be at large--to appear, perhaps, as a witness--to avow the manner in which the sense of Glaucus had been darkened, and thus win indulgence to the crime of which he was accused--how much more was she likely to volunteer her testimony when she herself had administered the draught, and, inspired by love, would be only anxious, at any expense of shame, to retrieve her error and preserve her beloved?
She was accustomed only to associate with the thought of Glaucus everything that was prosperous and lofty--she could not imagine that any peril, save from the madness of her love, could menace that sacred head.
He hugged himself now at the thought that these ends were effected: that one, at once the object of his passion and his fear, was in his power.
In that sanguine vanity common to men who through life have been invariably successful, whether in fortune or love, he flattered himself that when Glaucus had perished--when his name was solemnly blackened by the award of a legal judgment, his title to her love for ever forfeited by condemnation to death for the murder of her own brother--her affection would be changed to horror; and that his tenderness and his passion, assisted by all the arts with which he well knew how to dazzle woman&#39;s imagination, might elect him to that throne in her heart from which his rival would be so awfully expelled.
There may this heart, possessed of love, grow once more alive to ambition--there, amongst nations uncrushed by the Roman yoke, and to whose ear the name of Rome has not yet been wafted, I may found an empire, and transplant my ancestral creed; renewing the ashes of the dead Theban rule; continuing in yet grander shores the dynasty of my crowned fathers, and waking in the noble heart of Ione the grateful consciousness that she shares the lot of one who, far from the aged rottenness of this slavish civilization, restores the primal elements of greatness, and unites in one mighty soul the attributes of the prophet and the king.&#39;
He had sought Julia; he had detailed to her the confession of Nydia; he had easily, therefore, lulled any scruple of conscience which might have led her to extenuate the offence of Glaucus by avowing her share in his frenzy: and the more readily, for her vain heart had loved the fame and the prosperity of Glaucus--not Glaucus himself, she felt no affection for a disgraced man--nay, she almost rejoiced in the disgrace that humbled the hated Ione.
Nydia leaped up, as if an arrow had entered her heart; she uttered a piercing scream; then, falling before the feet of the slave, she cried, in a tone that melted even his rude heart: &#39;Ah!
Yes, she was evidently inveigled into some snare; she was contributing to the destruction of her beloved!
I have no love for apparitions.&#39;
As he thus soliloquised, he crossed through the open court into the peristyle, where a few lamps here and there broke upon the empire of the starlit night; and issuing from one of the chambers that bordered the colonnade, suddenly encountered Arbaces.
&#39;With all my heart,&#39; answered the priest; and the two friends passed slowly to one of the many terraces which, bordered by marble vases and sleeping flowers, intersected the garden.
Thou hast had countless wealth--a frame on whose close-woven fibres disease can find no space to enter--prosperous love--inexhaustible pleasure--and, even at this hour, triumphant revenge.&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I saw thy weapon pierce the heart of Apaecides.
&#39;Because,&#39; interrupted Arbaces, with a gentle smile, and tapping the priest on the shoulder with a kindly and familiar gesture--&#39;because, my Calenus (see now, I will read thy heart, and explain its motives)--because thou didst wish thoroughly to commit and entangle me in the trial, so that I might have no loophole of escape; that I might stand firmly pledged to perjury and to malice, as well as to homicide; that having myself whetted the appetite of the populace to blood, no wealth, no power, could prevent my becoming their victim: and thou tellest me thy secret now, ere the trial be over and the innocent condemned, to show what a desperate web of villainy thy word to-morrow could destroy; to enhance in this, the ninth hour, the price of thy forbearance; to show that my own arts, in arousing the popular wrath, would, at thy witness, recoil upon myself; and that if not for Glaucus, for me would gape the jaws of the lion!
&#39;Arbaces, replied Calenus, losing all the vulgar audacity of his natural character, &#39;verily thou art a Magician; thou readest the heart as it were a scroll.&#39;
Thou knowest that I have always loved thee better than all the other gods, and I will dedicate to thee that silver cup I stole last year from the burly carptor (butler), if thou wilt but befriend me with this water-loving demon.
While Sosia, thus entrapped, was lamenting his fate, and revolving his schemes to repossess himself of Nydia, the blind girl, with that singular precision and dexterous rapidity of motion, which, we have before observed, was peculiar to her, had passed lightly along the peristyle, threaded the opposite passage that led into the garden, and, with a beating heart, was about to proceed towards the gate, when she suddenly heard the sound of approaching steps, and distinguished the dreaded voice of Arbaces himself.
Oh, how beat the griping heart of Calenus, as he heard the rusty wards growl, as if resenting the admission to the treasures they guarded!
Oh, blessed stranger, in my heart is the urn which condemns or frees him!&#39;
Her heart beat: was it to be her proud destiny to preserve her idolized--her adored?
In her sanguine heart, joy was the predominant emotion.
WHEN Arbaces had warmed his veins by large draughts of that spiced and perfumed wine so valued by the luxurious, he felt more than usually elated and exultant of heart.
Our vain human nature hugs itself in the consciousness of superior craft and self-obtained success--afterwards comes the horrible reaction of remorse.
&#39;Yes; to make thee happy I would renounce my ill-fated love, and gladly join thy hand to the Athenian&#39;s.
And think not, O Ione, that I would follow thee longer with a prayer of love.
Is it for a dream that thou wouldst wrong the innocent, and hazard thy sole chance of saving thy lover&#39;s life?&#39;
Interrupt me not; but mark me, Arbaces!--if Glaucus die, on that same day I baffle thine arts, and leave to thy love only my dust!
&#39;Brave heart!&#39;
Queen of climes undarkened by the eagle&#39;s wing, unravaged by his beak, I bow before thee in homage and in awe--but I claim thee in worship and in love!
They weigh in the scales of the Kings of Death: they turn the balance on that day when the disembodied soul stands shivering and dismayed between Tartarus and Elysium; they gladden the heart in life, better and longer than the reward of a momentary passion.
He felt it was necessary that Ione should never learn of her lover&#39;s frenzy, lest it might excuse his imputed crime; and it was possible that her attendants might inform her that Nydia was under his roof, and she might desire to see her.
But what words can paint the intolerable woe, the sinking of the whole heart, which was now visible on the features of the Thessalian?
A few hours after the court had broken up and judgment been given, a small party of the fashionable youth at Pompeii were assembled round the fastidious board of Lepidus.
He probably rated Glaucus soundly about his gay life and gaming habits, and ultimately swore he would not consent to his marriage with Ione.
&#39;And pray,&#39; said one of the party, &#39;what has become of the poor girl whom Glaucus was to have married?
It was natural she should go to him when she had lost both lover and brother.&#39;
They say the rich Julia was in love with him.&#39;
Clodius become a married man?--Fie!&#39;
&#39;Never fear,&#39; answered Clodius; &#39;old Diomed is delighted at the notion of marrying his daughter to a nobleman, and will come down largely with the sesterces.
It will be a white day for his jolly friends, when Clodius marries an heiress.&#39;
So sudden had been that revolution of fortune which had prostrated him from the palmy height of youthful pleasure and successful love to the lowest abyss of ignominy, and the horror of a most bloody death, that he could scarcely convince himself that he was not held in the meshes of some fearful dream.
As he recalled his interview with Arbaces, and the causes of revenge which had been excited in the heart of that dark and fearful man, he could not but believe that he was the victim of some deep-laid and mysterious snare--the clue and train of which he was lost in attempting to discover: and Ione--Arbaces loved her--might his rival&#39;s success be founded upon his ruin?
That thought cut him more deeply than all; and his noble heart was more stung by jealousy than appalled by fear.
He is with me in the dungeon; His smile penetrates the darkness; on the eve of death my heart whispers immortality, and earth recedes from me but to bring the weary soul nearer unto heaven.&#39;
&#39;God alone reads the heart!
&#39;Yet it seemeth to me as if, in the divine anger, I had been smitten by a sudden madness, a supernatural and solemn frenzy, wrought not by human means.&#39;
&#39;Christian, believest thou, among the doctrines of thy creed, that the dead live again--that they who have loved here are united hereafter--that beyond the grave our good name shines pure from the mortal mists that unjustly dim it in the gross-eyed world--and that the streams which are divided by the desert and the rock meet in the solemn Hades, and flow once more into one?&#39;
continued Olinthus, passionately, &#39;bride of my heart!
There was something in this sudden burst of human affection which struck a kindred chord in the soul of the Greek.
No--not I. I should be made a witness in court, for what I know; and the way they cross-examine the slaves is by the torture.&#39;
I shall never live happily if I cannot, in his hour of trial and doom, let him know that one heart is grateful to him.
And Sosia, well knowing by experience that Cerberus loves a sop, thrust some half a dozen sesterces into the hand of the porter.
&#39;Yes,&#39; replied he, enviously; &#39;the women love a gladiator.
In counting the girls that we kiss, eh?
Content with the soft lips that love us, This music, this wine, and this mirth, boys, We care not for gods up above us-- We know there&#39;s no god for this earth, boys!
&quot;The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.&quot;&#39;
No passion--no human emotion, disturbed its brooding and unwrinkled brow: there was neither sadness, nor joy, nor memory, nor hope: it was free from all with which the wild human heart can sympathize.
dreamer of the stars, and would-be decipherer of the heart and origin of things!
As thou livest, know I in my heart that the earthquake that sixteen years ago shook this city to its solid base, was but the forerunner of more deadly doom.
&#39;It is not life that is sweet, but death that is awful,&#39; replied the hag, in a sharp, impressive tone, that struck forcibly upon the heart of the vain star-seer.
Reflect O my heart-- reflect, for the future, but two images--Empire and Ione!&#39;
The populace, not yet hardened into cruelty, made the signal of mercy; but as the attendants of the arena approached, they found the kindness came too late--the heart of the Gaul had been pierced, and his eyes were set in death.
Nepimus, the lesser man, I have never seen before: but he is the son of one of the imperial fiscales, and brought up in a proper school; doubtless they will show sport, but I have no heart for the game; I cannot win back my money--I am undone.
Eumolpus gazed hard on the face of Lydon; he smiled; yet the smile was followed by a slight and scarce audible sigh--a touch of compassionate emotion, which custom conquered the moment the heart acknowledged it.
He saw them not; they were as if the vast space was desolate and bare; one pale agonizing face alone was all he recognized--one cry of a broken heart was all that, amidst the murmurs and the shouts of the populace, reached his ear.
The ferocity vanished from his brow; a soft, a tender expression of sanctifying but despairing love played over his features--played--waned--darkened!
THRICE had Sallust awakened from his morning sleep, and thrice, recollecting that his friend was that day to perish, had he turned himself with a deep sigh once more to court oblivion.
&#39;I hear; my heart grows sick; but the gods support me.&#39;
Were I to embrace thy creed, and cast down my father&#39;s gods, should I not be bribed by thy promise of heaven, or awed by thy threats of hell?
As have been my deeds, such will be my reward; and the Power or Powers above will not judge harshly of human error, when it is linked with honesty of purpose and truth of heart.
&#39;Brother and co-mate, one last embrace!
The Christian opened his arms--he clasped the young heathen to his breast--he kissed his forehead and cheek--he sobbed aloud--his tears flowed fast and hot over the features of his new friend.
&#39;They whom death part not, may meet yet beyond the grave: on the earth--on the beautiful, the beloved earth, farewell for ever!--Worthy officer, I attend you.&#39;
It rang through the heart of the assembly with electric force--it, was touching, it was holy, that child&#39;s voice!
My first accuser is the noble Sallust--the most intimate friend of Glaucus!
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>As the sense of the dangers around them flashed on the Athenian, his generous heart recurred to Olinthus.
High thoughts and solemn absorbed his soul: and in the enthusiasm of his kindling heart, he exulted in the mercy of God rather than trembled at the evidence of His power.
The tears of the old man fell fast and hot, but he did not feel them; and when his lips moved, and he mechanically uttered the prayer of his benign and hopeful faith, neither his heart nor his sense responded to the words: it was but the involuntary emotion that broke from the lethargy of his mind.
His boy was dead, and had died for him!--and the old man&#39;s heart was broken!
Come hither!--place your hand on his heart!--sure it beats yet?&#39;
&#39;The poor boy, his love murdered him!&#39;
And Medon clasped the body tightly in his embrace, and covered it with passionate kisses.
Calenus passed them, and entered the chamber yet to be seen in the south side of the court.
He took heart; he stepped forth to join him, when a tremendous shower of ashes fell right before his feet.
Fly, dearest!--beloved, fly!
He caught his beloved in his arms, and with difficulty and labor gained the temple.
The beauty and the unselfishness of love could hallow even that dismal time!
ADVANCING, as men grope for escape in a dungeon, Ione and her lover continued their uncertain way.
my beloved!
One embrace!
let me feel thy arms around me--and in that embrace let me die--I can no more!&#39;
cried the Egyptian, &#39;Fate smiles upon me even through these horrors, and, amidst the dreadest aspects of woe and death, bodes me happiness and love.
Darkness once more wrapped them as a veil; and Glaucus, his bold heart at last quelled and despairing, sank beneath the cover of an arch, and, clasping Ione to his heart--a bride on that couch of ruin--resigned himself to die.
As the kindly epicure thus encouraged Nydia, he drew her along with him towards the sea, heeding not her passionate entreaties that he would linger yet awhile to search for Glaucus; and still, in the accent of despair, she continued to shriek out that beloved name, which, amidst all the roar of the convulsed elements, kept alive a music at her heart.
The tender joy of his voice pierced the heart of the poor Thessalian, and she blessed him for his thought of her.
The darlings of the deep were snatched from her embrace!
They looked at each other and smiled--they took heart--they felt once more that there was a world around, and a God above them!
What beloved friends, lost and missed in the gloom, might they not bear to safety and to shelter!
She bent over the face of Glaucus--she inhaled the deep breath of his heavy slumber--timidly and sadly she kissed his brow--his lips; she felt for his hand--it was locked in that of Ione; she sighed deeply, and her face darkened.
Again she kissed his brow, and with her hair wiped from it the damps of night.
she murmured: &#39;may you be happy with your beloved one!--may you sometimes remember Nydia!
&#39;It is the kiss of death,&#39; she said &#39;it is welcome.&#39;
she said, half aloud, and in a musing and thoughtful tone, &#39;I cannot endure it; this jealous, exacting love--it shatters my whole soul in madness!
They say that in thy embrace is dishonour--that thy victims cross not the fatal Styx--be it so!--I would not meet him in the Shades, for I should meet him still with her!
there is no other Elysium for a heart like mine!&#39;
GLAUCUS to his beloved Sallust--greeting and health!--You request me to visit you at Rome--no, Sallust, come rather to me at Athens!
You dwell with rapture on the Roman splendors, and the luxuries of the imperial court.
My mind has never shaken off the dark shadow of the Last Day of Pompeii--the horror and the desolation of that awful ruin!--Our beloved, our remembered Nydia!
I listened--believed--adored!
My own, my more than ever beloved Ione, has also embraced the creed!--a creed, Sallust, which, shedding light over this world, gathers its concentrated glory, like a sunset, over the next!
&#39;Ione--at that name my heart yet beats!--Ione is by my side as I write: I lift my eyes, and meet her smile.
If anything can make me forget that I am an Athenian and not free, it is partly the soothing--the love--watchful, vivid, sleepless--of Ione--a love that has taken a new sentiment in our new creed--a love which none of our poets, beautiful though they be, had shadowed forth in description; for mingled with religion, it partakes of religion; it is blended with pure and unworldly thoughts; it is that which we may hope to carry through eternity, and keep, therefore, white and unsullied, that we may not blush to confess it to our God!
This is the true type of the dark fable of our Grecian Eros and Psyche--it is, in truth, the soul asleep in the arms of love.
And if this, our love, support me partly against the fever of the desire for freedom, my religion supports me more; for whenever I would grasp the sword and sound the shell, and rush to a new Marathon (but Marathon without victory), I feel my despair at the chilling thought of my country&#39;s impotence--the crushing weight of the Roman yoke, comforted, at least, by the thought that earth is but the beginning of life--that the glory of a few years matters little in the vast space of eternity--that there is no perfect freedom till the chains of clay fall from the soul, and all space, all time, become its heritage and domain.

&#39;It is another fact, that I am going to be married again.&#39;
&#39;My approaching marriage,&#39; she said, &#39;has one embarrassing circumstance connected with it.
I have innocently robbed her of her lover, and destroyed her prospects in life.
If the letter had left him any hope of being forgiven, I would have positively refused to marry him.
He appealed to my compassion; he appealed to his love for me.
In a week more (I tremble as I think of it) we are to be married.&#39;
It was the woman whom I had robbed of her lover, the woman who had written the noble letter.
I went next to the man whom I am to marry.
&quot;If you refuse to marry me,&quot; he said, &quot;you admit that these reports are true--you admit that you are afraid to face society in the character of my wife.&quot;
He tried vainly to think of her as a person to be pitied--a person with a morbidly sensitive imagination, conscious of the capacities for evil which lie dormant in us all, and striving earnestly to open her heart to the counter-influence of her own better nature; the effort was beyond him.
It was doubtful whether she had ever been married to the Count whose widow she assumed to be.
He was asked derisively what he thought of the circumstances under which the Countess had become engaged to be married; and he made the characteristic answer, that he thought the circumstances highly creditable to both parties, and that he looked on the lady&#39;s future husband as a most enviable man.
Hearing this, the Doctor raised another shout of astonishment by inquiring the name of the gentleman whom the Countess was about to marry.
A man who did not know that the Countess Narona had borrowed money at Homburg of no less a person than Lord Montbarry, and had then deluded him into making her a proposal of marriage, was a man who had probably never heard of Lord Montbarry himself.
Not married.
Will be married next week, Doctor, to the delightful creature we have been talking about.
Heir presumptive, his lordship&#39;s next brother, Stephen Robert, married to Ella, youngest daughter of the Reverend Silas Marden, Rector of Runnigate, and has issue, three daughters.
Sisters of his lordship, Lady Barville, married to Sir Theodore Barville, Bart.
Not one of the five will be present at the marriage; and not one of the five will leave a stone unturned to stop it, if the Countess will only give them a chance.
She was described as being the superior of the Countess in personal attraction, and as being also by some years the younger woman of the two.
Not one of them could call to mind the innumerable instances in which the sexual influence has proved irresistible in the persons of women without even the pretension to beauty.
While the topic of the Countess&#39;s marriage was still the one topic of conversation, a member of the club entered the smoking-room whose appearance instantly produced a dead silence.
Who can say she has a mercenary motive in marrying him?&#39;
&#39;May I ask who made that settlement a condition of the marriage?&#39;
In his leisure moments he found himself wondering whether Lord Montbarry&#39;s family would succeed in stopping the marriage after all.
They were both Roman Catholics, and they were to be married at the chapel in Spanish Place.
On the day of the wedding, after a feeble struggle with himself, he actually sacrificed his patients and their guineas, and slipped away secretly to see the marriage.
Never, on the face of it, was there a less interesting and less romantic marriage than this.
The interval passed, and the married couple, returning to the church, walked together down the nave to the door.
CHAPTER IV On the day of the marriage Agnes Lockwood sat alone in the little drawing-room of her London lodgings, burning the letters which had been written to her by Montbarry in the bygone time.
There were none of the ordinary signs of grief in her face, as she slowly tore the letters of her false lover in two, and threw the pieces into the small fire which had been lit to consume them.
There had been a long past time when Henry Westwick had owned that he loved her.
She had made her confession to him, acknowledging that her heart was given to his eldest brother.
But now, on the very day when his brother&#39;s marriage to another woman had consummated his brother&#39;s treason towards her, there was something vaguely repellent in the prospect of seeing him.
&#39;Is it true,&#39; she asked, after a long silence, &#39;that they have been married to-day?&#39;
He will live to rue the day when he married that woman!&#39;
I was wondering whether anything which has so entirely filled my heart, and so absorbed all that is best and truest in me, as my feeling for your brother, can really pass away as if it had never existed.
Am I as entirely parted from the good and evil fortune of his life as if we had never met and never loved?
She left me, to marry an Italian courier, named Ferrari--and I am afraid it has not turned out very well.
Her face flushed again, and the next instant turned paler than ever; she knew his heart as well as he knew it himself--she was too distressed to speak.
He lifted her hand to his lips, kissed it fervently, and, without looking at her again, left the room.
Am I as entirely parted from the good and evil fortune of his life as if we had never met and never loved?&#39;
But she had loved too faithfully, she had been wounded too deeply, to feel in any adequate degree the influence of the moral remedies which she employed.
&#39;Dear Emily,&#39; and &#39;Yours affectionately&#39;--these conventional phrases, were the only phrases of endearment which they contained.
Agnes handed back the letters--so suggestive of the penalty paid already for his own infatuation by the man who had deserted her!--with feelings of shame and distress, which made her no fit counsellor for the helpless woman who depended on her advice.
Weary and heartsick, Agnes lay down on the sofa, to rest and compose herself.
Have you any friend in that interesting city, with a large heart, and a purse to correspond, who has been let into the secret and who wishes to console you anonymously?&#39;
We will say, then, that Lord Montbarry has presumably been made the victim of a foul wrong--that Mr. Ferrari was the first to find it out--and that the guilty persons had reason to fear, not only that he would acquaint Lord Montbarry with his discovery, but that he would be a principal witness against them if the scandal was made public in a court of law.
Troy permitted his natural kindness of heart to show itself on the surface at last.
One after another, he looked at the objects that reminded him of the woman whom he loved--took them up tenderly--and laid them down again with a sigh.
Miserable, miserable wretch--how she loved him!&#39;
In spite of her resolution, Mrs. Ferrari&#39;s heart beat as if it would burst out of her bosom, when her conductress led her into an ante-room, and knocked at a door opening into a room beyond.
In the one instant while these events passed, timid little Mrs. Ferrari mastered her own throbbing heart; stepped over the threshold, conscious of her clammy hands, dry lips, and burning head; and stood in the presence of Lord Montbarry&#39;s widow, to all outward appearance as supremely self-possessed as her ladyship herself.
Was he married by any chance?
When I first met you, before my marriage, and first felt your influence over me, I had that hope.
Or, if you must think of the time that is passed, can you not look back to the time when I first loved you?&#39;
At that moment he would have given everything he had in the world to take her in his arms and kiss her.
It was impossible that the &#39;change in her life&#39; of which she had spoken could mean that she was about to be married--and yet he was conscious of a perfectly unreasonable reluctance to open the letter.
Your loving Lucy, who writes this.
The children love me; the mother loves me; the father has shown me innumerable instances of his true friendship and regard.
I believe they have courage enough and heart enough to say Yes.&#39;
While her heart was empty, her heart was accessible.
</pre></div>

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&#39;He would never have heart enough to remember them himself!&#39;
when I go to bid her good-night, she&#39;ll give me a big kiss, poor dear--and say, Nurse, I didn&#39;t mean it!
If I lost it all to-morrow, I shouldn&#39;t break my heart; I&#39;m well enough off, as it is, for the rest of my days.
She was to visit the Westwicks for a month--and, if she really liked teaching the children, she was then to be governess, aunt, and cousin, all in one--and was only to go away in an event which her friends in Ireland persisted in contemplating, the event of her marriage.
Henry tried to kiss her at parting.
Her refusal to grant him his privilege as a cousin was a good sign--it was indirectly an act of encouragement to him in the character of her lover.
Stephen and I have arranged to call her by her foreign title, before she was married.
Are you aware that he is married?&#39;
&#39;Are you in love with Miss Haldane already?&#39;
She was, it is needless to say, perfectly well aware that he was in love with her, while he was himself modestly reticent on the subject--so far as words went.
They had themselves married early in life--and, strange to say, they did not object on principle to the early marriages of other people.
The question of age being thus disposed of, the course of true love had no other obstacles to encounter.
CHAPTER XV (MISS AGNES LOCKWOOD TO MRS. FERRARI) &#39;I promised to give you some account, dear Emily, of the marriage of Mr. Arthur Barville and Miss Haldane.
If you add to the persons whom I have already mentioned, the elder members of Mrs. Carbury&#39;s family, and the old servants in both houses--privileged to drink the healths of the married pair at the lower end of the room--you will have the list of the company at the wedding-breakfast complete.
What do you say (if you have no engagements that will prevent it) to joining our young married friends before the close of their tour, and renewing the social success of this delightful breakfast by another festival in honour of the honeymoon?
Your affectionate friend, Adela Montbarry.&#39;
Pondering over a new form of theatrical attraction for the coming winter season, Francis had determined to revive the languid public taste for the ballet by means of an entertainment of his own invention, combining dramatic interest with dancing.
Can such a woman as Agnes give her love or refuse it, according to circumstances?
If you really love her, wait; and trust to your two best friends--to time and to me.
She was more interested in meeting the young married couple than in awaiting the result of the hard bargaining which delayed the engagement of the new dancer; and she volunteered to make her brother&#39;s apologies, if his theatrical business caused him to be late in keeping his appointment at the honeymoon festival.
In the old times, she had been noted in the family as the one member of it who lived on affectionate terms with Montbarry.
My little loves, do you sniff a nasty smell here--ha?&#39;
Call me by my name before I committed the fatal mistake of marrying your brother.
&#39;She was nearer to the heart of the Montbarry who is dead than any of you,&#39; the Countess answered sternly.
With her heart in the tomb of the dead Montbarry, could Agnes even think of another man, and think of love?
Her head was in a whirl; her heart beat furiously, without any assignable cause.
In the moment when she turned, the chill of a sudden terror gripped her round the heart, as with the clasp of an icy hand.
The old ardour and impetuosity were nearly worn out.
But I feel in my heart of hearts that you are deceived.
&#39;Agnes,&#39; he said, &#39;are you beginning to understand how truly I love you?&#39;
That simple question found its own way to her heart.
he whispered--and kissed her.
To one of these reports (which falsely and abominably points to the Baron as her lover instead of her brother) she now refers with just indignation.
Take your choice, between marrying my Lord&#39;s income, in the interest of my grand discovery--or leave me to sell myself and my title to the first rich woman of low degree who is ready to buy me.&quot;
Take five minutes to consider what I have said to you, and tell me on my return which of us is to marry for the money I want, you or I.&quot;
Take as stepping-stones on the way to your triumph, my love, my liberty, and my life!&quot;
Henry paused between the First and Second Acts; reflecting, not on the merits of the play, but on the strange resemblance which the incidents so far presented to the incidents that had attended the disastrous marriage of the first Lord Montbarry.
The Countess has sacrificed herself; the mercenary marriage has taken place--but not without obstacles, caused by difference of opinion on the question of marriage settlements.
&quot;Let us by all means&quot; (he says) &quot;consider the marriage as broken off.&quot;
My lord is in love; the natural result follows--he gives way.
But my Lord&#39;s turn comes, when the marriage has been celebrated, and when the honeymoon is over.
The Baron has joined the married pair at a palace which they have hired in Venice.
She can only answer that her noble husband (being no longer distractedly in love with her) now appears in his true character, as one of the meanest men living.
The sacrifice of the marriage has been made, and has already proved useless.
He closed the manuscript, heartsick and exhausted, and threw himself on his bed to rest.
&#39;But if you will be guided by me, spare yourself the reading of those pages to come, which describe our brother&#39;s terrible expiation of his heartless marriage.&#39;
My wife has committed a breach of confidence--I believe Agnes will marry you.
In the spring of the new year, the marriage took place.
During the last few days of the residence of the newly married couple by the riverside, Lady Montbarry&#39;s children were invited to enjoy a day&#39;s play in the garden.
&#39;Henry, I want you to give me a kiss.&#39;

From what is said in the Introduction to the Monastery, it must necessarily be inferred, that the Author considered that romance as something very like a failure.
The Monastery was designed, at first, to have contained some supernatural agency, arising out of the fact, that Melrose had been the place of deposit of the great Robert Bruce&#39;s heart.
Thus, the incident of the discovery of the heart, which occupies the greater part of the Introduction to the Monastery, is a mystery unnecessarily introduced, and which remains at last very imperfectly explained.
That which relates to Queen Mary&#39;s escape from Lochleven Castle, is a more minute account of that romantic adventure, than is to be found in the histories of the period.
Two circumstances only had imbittered their union, which was otherwise as happy as mutual affection could render it.
Hence, when danger was near--and it was seldom far distant--Sir Halbert Glendinning, for he now bore the rank of knighthood, was perpetually summoned to attend his patron on distant expeditions, or on perilous enterprises, or to assist him with his counsel in the doubtful intrigues of a half-barbarous court.
The precise day, therefore, of Sir Halbert&#39;s return, was not fixed, but that which his lady&#39;s fond expectation had calculated upon in her own mind had long since passed, and hope delayed began to make the heart sick.
The thought sunk on her heart with a bitterness which resembled envy, so deeply is the desire of offspring implanted in the female breast.
the love and affection that I long to bestow, is of a quality higher than can fall to thy share, though I love thee much.&quot;
&quot;It shall be my charge,&quot; said the Lady; and again throwing her arms around the boy, she overwhelmed him with kisses and caresses, so much was she agitated by the terror arising from the danger in which he had been just placed, and by joy at his unexpected deliverance.
&quot;I will read the dream for you, my love,&quot; answered the Lady of Avenel; &quot;and I will be myself your mother.
There is but one in which we may indulge to the utmost limit of vehemence of which our bosom is capable, secure that excess cannot exist in the greatest intensity to which it can be excited--I mean the love of our Maker.&quot;
&quot;Surely,&quot; said the Lady of Avenel, &quot;we are commanded by the same authority to love our neighbour?&quot;
&quot;Ay, madam,&quot; said Warden, &quot;but our love to God is to be unbounded--we are to love him with our whole heart, our whole soul, and our whole strength.
The love which the precept commands us to bear to our neighbour, has affixed to it a direct limit and qualification--we are to love our neighbour as ourself; as it is elsewhere explained by the great commandment, that we must do unto him as we would that he should do unto us.
We are to render to our neighbour, whatever be his rank or degree, that corresponding portion of affection with which we could rationally expect we should ourselves be regarded by those standing in the same relation to us.
Men, as well as animals, are jealous of the affections of those they love.&quot;
&quot;Nay, but,&quot; said the Lady, who both loved and respected the good man, though sometimes a little offended at what she conceived to be an exuberant degree of zeal, &quot;we will not part this way, my good friend.
But the boy was naturally of an undaunted temper; and indeed children are generally acute physiognomists, and not only pleased by that which is beautiful in itself, but peculiarly quick in distinguishing and replying to the attentions of those who really love them.
What woman but must pity the agony of the mother, whose heart is throbbing for the safety of a child so lovely!&quot;
&quot;Be she who she will, Lilias,&quot; replied the Lady, &quot;she must have an aching heart while the safety of a creature so lovely is uncertain.
&quot;Ay,&quot; answered the old woman, in the same style of bitter irony, &quot;I know the wages of that service;--a curse when the corslet is not sufficiently brightened,--a blow when the girth is not tightly drawn,--to be beaten because the hounds are at fault,--to be reviled because the foray is unsuccessful,--to stain his hands for the master&#39;s bidding in the blood alike of beast and of man,--to be a butcher of harmless deer, a murderer and defacer of God&#39;s own image, not at his own pleasure, but at that of his lord,--to live a brawling ruffian, and a common stabber--exposed to heat, to cold, to want of food, to all the privations of an anchoret, not for the love of God, but for the service of Satan,--to die by the gibbet, or in some obscure skirmish,--to sleep out his brief life in carnal security, and to awake in the eternal fire, which is never quenched.&quot;
I will not soften my heart by useless tears and wailings, as one that is not called to a duty.&quot;
Know that the rank of the man rates that of the wife, and that she who marries a churl&#39;s son, were she a king&#39;s daughter, is but a peasant&#39;s bride.&quot;
He became the object of those affectionate feelings, which, finding formerly no object on which to expand themselves, had increased the gloom of the castle, and imbittered the solitude of its mistress.
Young Roland was to the Lady of Avenel what the flower, which occupies the window of some solitary captive, is to the poor wight by whom it is nursed and cultivated,--something which at once excited and repaid her care; and in giving the boy her affection, she felt, as it were, grateful to him for releasing her from the state of dull apathy in which she had usually found herself during the absence of Sir Halbert Glendinning.
His appearance banished the thoughts of every thing else; she rushed to him, clasped his iron-sheathed frame in her arms, and kissed his martial and manly face with an affection which was at once evident and sincere.
The warrior returned her embrace and her caress with the same fondness; for the time which had passed since their union had diminished its romantic ardour, perhaps, but it had rather increased its rational tenderness, and Sir Halbert Glendinning&#39;s long and frequent absences from his castle had prevented affection from degenerating by habit into indifference.
Still, over these noble features, there now spread an air of dejection, of which, perhaps, the owner was not conscious, but which did not escape the observation of his anxious and affectionate partner.
&quot;What would the knowledge have availed, but to have rendered you unhappy, my love?&quot;
&quot;Really, and really,&quot; said the Knight, taking her hand in affectionate playfulness, &quot;I have done this marvellous deed--have rolled on the ocean for three days and three nights, with the deep green waves dashing by the side of my pillow, and but a thin plank to divide me from it.&quot;
The fate that made you Scotsman by birth, gave you head, and heart, and hand, to uphold the name as it must needs be upheld.&quot;
Good men love and honour you, the wicked fear, and the turbulent obey you; and is it not necessary you should exert yourself to ensure the endurance of that love, that honour, and wholesome fear, and that necessary obedience?&quot;
&quot;Nay, Dame Mary,&quot; answered the Knight, &quot;it is enough you desire such an attendant.--Yet I have never loved to nurse such useless menials--a lady&#39;s page--it may well suit the proud English dames to have a slender youth to bear their trains from bower to hall, fan them when they slumber, and touch the lute for them when they please to listen; but our Scottish matrons were wont to be above such vanities, and our Scottish youth ought to be bred to the spear and the stirrup.&quot;
Roland entered accordingly, and, flying to the Lady&#39;s side, took hold of the plaits of her gown, and then turned round, and gazed with an attention not unmingled with fear, upon the stately form of the Knight.--&quot;Roland,&quot; said the Lady, &quot;go kiss the hand of the noble Knight, and ask him to be thy protector.&quot;
Go, kiss Sir Halbert&#39;s hand.&quot;
&quot;I will kiss no hand save yours, Lady,&quot; answered the boy.
There is nothing wrong in relieving the distressed orphan, or in loving that which is in itself lovely and deserving of affection.
&quot;Be it as you please, my love,&quot; he replied; &quot;I owe you too much to contradict you in aught which may render your solitary mode of life more endurable.
It is true, her wisdom and affection on all occasions discountenanced the distinction which was here implied; but the villagers persisted in thinking it must be agreeable to her to enjoy their peculiar and undivided homage, or at least in acting as if they thought so; and one chief mode by which they evinced their sentiments, was by the respect they paid to young Roland Graeme, the favourite attendant of the descendant of their ancient lords.
Roland Graeme was sufficiently sensible of the unpleasant situation in which he stood; but in the haughtiness of his heart he retorted upon the other domestics the distant, cold, and sarcastic manner in which they treated him, assumed an air of superiority which compelled the most obstinate to obedience, and had the satisfaction at least to be dreaded, if he was heartily hated.
He was a favourite in his department, jealous and conceited of his skill, as masters of the game usually are; for the rest of his character he was a jester and a parcel poet, (qualities which by no means abated his natural conceit,) a jolly fellow, who, though a sound Protestant, loved a flagon of ale better than a long sermon, a stout man of his hands when need required, true to his master, and a little presuming on his interest with him.
Our Lady, my benison upon her, is also a noble person of long descent, and rightful heir of this place and barony, and she also loves her will; as for that matter, show me the woman who doth not.
Now, she hath favoured, doth favour, and will favour, this jack-an-ape,--for what good part about him I know not, save that as one noble lady will love a messan dog, and another a screaming popinjay, and a third a Barbary ape, so doth it please our noble dame to set her affections upon this stray elf of a page, for nought that I can think of, save that she--was the cause of his being saved (the more&#39;s the pity) from drowning.&quot;
&quot;I would have been his caution for a gray groat against salt water or fresh,&quot; said Roland&#39;s adversary, the falconer; &quot;marry, if he crack not a rope for stabbing or for snatching, I will be content never to hood hawk again.&quot;
&quot;Peace, Adam Woodcock,&quot; said Wingate, waving his hand; &quot;I prithee, peace man--Now, my Lady liking this springald, as aforesaid, differs therein from my Lord, who loves never a bone in his skin.
In pursuance of her plan, Mistress Lilias failed not to present herself before her mistress with all the exterior of one who is possessed of an important secret,--that is, she had the corners of her mouth turned down, her eyes raised up, her lips pressed as fast together as if they had been sewed up, to prevent her babbling, and an air of prim mystical importance diffused over her whole person and demeanour, which seemed to intimate, &quot;I know something which I am resolved not to tell you!&quot;
You, honoured madam, (a word which I do not use according to the vain forms of this world, but because I have ever loved and honoured you as an honourable and elect lady,)--you, I say, madam, have been pleased, contrary to my poor but earnest counsel, to raise this boy from his station, into one approaching to your own.&quot;
Warden,&quot; said the Lady, considerably offended, &quot;you are my husband&#39;s ancient friend, and I believe your love sincere to him and to his household.
If I have done wrong in loving this poor orphan lad more than others of his class, I scarce think the error merited such severe censure; and if stricter discipline were required to keep his fiery temper in order, it ought, I think, to be considered, that I am a woman, and that if I have erred in this matter, it becomes a friend&#39;s part rather to aid than to rebuke me.
He loves not domestic discord or domestic brawls; and I would not willingly that he thought such could arise from one whom I favoured--What do you counsel me to do?&quot;
Profit by the example of the miserable sinner that has passed from us, and embrace the means of grace while it is called to-day &#39;ere your conscience is seared as with a fire-brand, and your ears deafened like those of the adder, and your heart hardened like the nether mill-stone.
The thoughts of this orphan boy clung to her heartstrings with a fondness for which she herself was unable to account.
My proper descent I know not; but my only relation has said, and my heart has echoed it back and attested the truth, that I am sprung of gentle blood, and deserve gentle usage.&quot;
&quot;And what,&quot; said the youth, &quot;if I sustained wrong from those you loved and favoured, was I to disturb your peace with idle tale-bearings and eternal complaints?
He threw himself on his knees, kissed the hand which she did not withdraw, and then, hastily left the apartment.
&quot;And now tell me, Master Wingate,&quot; continued the damsel, &quot;do not the very cockles of your heart rejoice at the house being rid of this upstart whelp, that flung us all into shadow?&quot;
There will be a learned young divine with some new doctrine--a learned leech with some new drug--a bold cavalier, who will not be refused the favour of wearing her colours at a running at the ring--a cunning harper that could harp the heart out of woman&#39;s breast, as they say Signer David Rizzio did to our poor Queen;--these are the sort of folk who supply the loss of a well-favoured favourite, and not an old steward, or a middle-aged waiting-woman.&quot;
Roland Graeme compelled himself to walk on while they were within sight of each other that his former intimate might not augur any vacillation of purpose, or uncertainty of object, from his remaining on the same spot; but the effort was a painful one.
He kept resolutely moving forward, in spite of the internal agitation to which these symptoms belonged, until the distant form of his acquaintance disappeared behind the slope of a hill, when his heart failed at once; and, sitting down on the turf, remote from human ken, he gave way to the natural expressions of wounded pride, grief, and fear, and wept with unrestrained profusion and unqualified bitterness.
And have I done well to accept the hospitality, the more than maternal kindness, of my protectress, yet to detain from her the knowledge of my religion?--but she shall know that a Catholic has as much gratitude as a Puritan--that I have been thoughtless, but not wicked--that in my wildest moments I have loved, respected, and honoured her--and that the orphan boy might indeed be heedless, but was never ungrateful!&quot;
He stood still, and his pride rallying with constitutional obstinacy against his more just feeling, urged that he would incur the scorn of the Lady of Avenel, rather than obtain her favour, by following the course which the first ardour of his repentant feelings had dictated to him.
&quot;If I had but some plausible pretext,&quot; he thought, &quot;some ostensible reason for my return, some excuse to allege which might show I came not as a degraded supplicant, or a discarded menial, I might go thither--but as I am, I cannot--my heart would leap from its place and burst.&quot;
&quot;Why, this is hearty now,&quot; said Woodcock; &quot;I always said you had a kind heart, though you have a spice of the devil in your disposition, that is certain.
As there were few of the secular clergy who durst venture to reside so near the Border, the assistance of this monk in spiritual affairs had not been useless to the community, while the Catholic religion retained the ascendancy; as he could marry, christen, and administer the other sacraments of the Roman church.
Thus would I again meet the child of my love--the hope of my aged eyes.&quot;
She raised and embraced him, with affection indeed, but not unmixed with gravity which amounted almost to sternness.
As she spoke, she bent her head towards the broken image, with a countenance in which strong resentment and zeal were mingled with an expression of ecstatic devotion; she raised her left hand aloft as in the act of making a vow, and thus proceeded; &quot;Bear witness for me, blessed symbol of our salvation, bear witness, holy saint, within whose violated temple we stand, that as it is not for vengeance of my own that my hate pursues these people, so neither, for any favour or earthly affection towards any amongst them, will I withdraw my hand from the plough, when it shall pass through the devoted furrow!
Notwithstanding the wild and singular expression of this female, she appeared to retain towards Roland Graeme, in a strong degree, that affectionate and sedulous love which women bear to their nurslings, and the children dependent on their care.
It seemed as if she would not permit him to do aught for himself which in former days her attention had been used to do for him, and that she considered the tall stripling before her as being equally dependent on her careful attention as when he was the orphan child, who had owed all to her affectionate solicitude.
And with affectionate inconsistency, totally different from her usual manner, she added, &quot;Roland, you must not fast; you have dispensation; you are young, and to youth food and sleep are necessaries not to be dispensed with.
To them the watch spent in prayer is a refreshing slumber, and the sense of doing the will of Heaven is a richer banquet than the tables of monarchs can spread before them!--But do thou sleep soft, my son,&quot; she said, relapsing from the tone of fanaticism into that of maternal affection and tenderness; &quot;do thou sleep sound while life is but young with thee, and the cares of the day can be drowned in the slumbers of the evening.
He obeyed, indeed, awed into submission by the sudden recurrence of former subordination, and by feelings of affection and gratitude.
He remembered this person, who had stood to him in the relation of a mother, as equally affectionate in her attention, and absolute in her authority.
A singular mixture of love and fear attended upon his early remembrances as they were connected with her; and the fear that she might desire to resume the same absolute control over his motions--a fear which her conduct of yesterday did not tend much to dissipate--weighed heavily against the joy of this second meeting.
A sense of gratitude towards the person against whom his heart thus rebelled, checked his course of feeling.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;The blessing of the morning on your youthful head, my son,&quot; she said, with a solemnity of expression which thrilled the youth to the heart, so sad and earnest did the benediction flow from her lips, in a tone where devotion was blended with affection.
She uttered these words with an affectionate and anxious tone, which showed, that devotional as were the habitual exercises of her mind, the thoughts of her nursling yet bound her to earth with the cords of human affection and passion.
she exclaimed; &quot;false both to religion and to natural duty, hast thou lost what was sent so far, and at such risk, a token of the truest affection, that should have been, every bead of it, as dear to thee as thine eyeballs?&quot;
Roland, by obedience only canst thou show thy affection and thy gratitude.
&quot;Doubt it not, mother,&quot; replied the youth, &quot;I will, and that with all my heart; only----&quot; &quot;Nay, I receive no qualifications of thy promise,&quot; said Magdalen Graeme, catching at the word, &quot;the obedience which I require is absolute; and a blessing on thee, thou darling memory of my beloved child, that thou hast power to make a promise so hard to human pride!
She dwelt unnoticed and alone, Beside the springs of Dove: A maid whom there was none to praise, And very few to love.
&quot;My step would be lighter,&quot; he thought, &quot;and so would my heart, could I but have returned to see her for one instant, and to say, Lady, the orphan boy was wild, but not ungrateful!&quot;
The court before the door, which had once been defended with a species of low outer-wall, now ruinous, was paved, but the stones were completely covered with long gray nettles, thistles, and other weeds, which, shooting up betwixt the flags, had displaced many of them from their level.
As she thus spoke, they entered the court before the old mansion, and Roland could observe that the front of it had formerly been considerably ornamented with carved work, in the same dark-coloured freestone of which it was built.
Here they stopped, and the mistress of the mansion, for such she was, embraced Magdalen Graeme, and greeting her by the title of sister, kissed her with much solemnity, on either side of the face.
Strict neatness and cleanliness of person, seemed to intimate, that if poor, she was not reduced to squalid or heart-broken distress, and that she was still sufficiently attached to life to retain a taste for its decencies, if not its elegancies.
&quot;Thou art a happy woman, sister Magdalen,&quot; answered her companion, &quot;that, lifted so high above human affection and human feeling, thou canst bind such a victim to the horns of the altar.
She then continued to look at Roland with a mournful aspect of compassion, until the intentness of her gaze occasioned his colour to rise, and he was about to move out of its influence, when he was stopped by his grand-mother with one hand, while with the other she divided the hair upon his forehead, which was now crimson with bashfulness, while she added, with a mixture of proud affection and firm resolution,--&quot;Ay, look at him well, my sister, for on a fairer face thine eye never rested.
A court page would not have left her long alone in her mirth; but Roland was country-bred, and, besides, having some jealousy as well as bashfulness, he took it into his head that he was himself the object of her inextinguishable laughter.
I love dearly to know what my acquaintances can do at need.&quot;
It was one of those glances which would require the threefold plate of brass around the heart, more than it is needed by the mariners, to whom Horace recommends it.
&quot;It is in the cause of Heaven that I command them to embrace,&quot; said Magdalen, with the full force of her powerful voice; &quot;the end, sister, sanctifies the means we must use.&quot;
&quot;I say, embrace each other, my children.&quot;
But Roland Graeme, instead of tracing these peculiarities of character in the two old damps, only waited with great anxiety for the return of Catherine, expecting probably that the proposal of the fraternal embrace would be renewed, as his grandmother seemed disposed to carry matters with a high hand.
His expectations, or hopes, if we may call them so, were, however, disappointed; for, when Catherine re-entered on the summons of the Abbess, and placed on the table an earthen pitcher of water, and four wooden platters, with cups of the same materials, the Dame of Heathergill, satisfied with the arbitrary mode in which she had borne down the opposition of the Abbess, pursued her victory no farther--a moderation for which her grandson, in his heart, returned her but slender thanks.
Notwithstanding his indifferent cheer, the heart of Roland Graeme bounded high at this proposal, which he doubted not would lead to another _t�te-�-t�te_ betwixt him and the pretty novice.
Catherine, it would seem, had no mind so far to indulge him; for, moved either by delicacy or caprice, or some of those indescribable shades betwixt the one and the other, with which women love to tease, and at the same time to captivate, the ruder sex, she reminded the Abbess that it was necessary she should retire an hour before vespers; and, receiving the ready and approving nod of her Superior, she arose to withdraw.
This she performed very demurely; but the party on whom the salutation was conferred, thought he could discern in her manner an arch and mischievous exultation over his secret disappointment.--&quot;The devil take the saucy girl,&quot; he thought in his heart, though the presence of the Abbess should have repressed all such profane imaginations,--&quot;she is as hard-hearted as the laughing hyaena that the story-books tell of--she has a mind that I shall not forget her this night at least.&quot;
At Kennaquhair I shall see Father Ambrose;--at Edinburgh I shall find the means of shaping my own course through this bustling world, without burdening my affectionate relation--at Edinburgh, too, I shall see again the witching novice, with her blue eyes and her provoking smile.&quot;
One only human affection gleamed through her enthusiastic energies, like the broken glimpses of the sun through the rising clouds of a storm.
Her life she would willingly have laid down to save the earthly object of her affection; but that object itself she was ready to hazard, and would have been willing to sacrifice, could the restoration of the Church of Rome have been purchased with his blood.
Her discourse by the way, excepting on the few occasions in which her extreme love of her grandson found opportunity to display itself in anxiety for his health and accommodation, turned entirely on the duty of raising up the fallen honours of the Church, and replacing a Catholic sovereign on the throne.
for his marriage with Anne Boleyn, the prophetess was attainted in Parliament, and executed with her accomplices.
But one or two, who nourished in their bosoms respect for the downfallen hierarchy--casting first a timorous glance around, to see that no one observed them--hastily crossed themselves--bent their knee to Sister Magdalen, by which name they saluted her--kissed her hand, or even the hem of her dalmatique--received with humility the Benedicite with which she repaid their obeisance; and then starting up, and again looking timidly round to see that they had been unobserved, hastily resumed their journey.
&quot;I know it,&quot; said Magdalen; &quot;my heart told me long ere your lips had uttered his name.
The most fatal symptom of the whole appeared to be, that, though this violence had now been committed for many months, the Fathers had lost so totally all heart and resolution, that they had not adventured even upon clearing away the rubbish, or restoring the church to some decent degree of order.
With hasty and maimed rites, the few remaining brethren stepped forward alternately to give their new Abbot the kiss of peace, in token of fraternal affection and spiritual homage.
But the sports thus licensed assumed a very different appearance, so soon as the Protestant doctrines began to prevail; and the license which their forefathers had exercised in mere gaiety of heart, and without the least intention of dishonouring religion by their frolics, were now persevered in by the common people as a mode of testifying their utter disregard for the Roman priesthood and its ceremonies.
I may observe, for example, the case of an apparitor sent to Borthwick from the Primate of Saint Andrews, to cite the lord of that castle, who was opposed by an Abbot of Unreason, at whose command the officer of the spiritual court was appointed to be ducked in a mill-dam, and obliged to eat up his parchment citation.
_Sumner._ Yes, marry is it.
But in especial the dragon, lately so formidably rampant, now relaxed the terror of his claws, uncoiled his tremendous rings, and grumbled out of his fiery throat in a repentant tone, &quot;By the mass, I thought no harm in exercising our old pastime, but an I had thought the good Father would have taken it so to heart, I would as soon have played your devil, as your dragon.&quot;
Satisfied in some degree by this man&#39;s assurances, and compelled--to give way to superior force, the Abbot Ambrosius retired from the Church at the head of the monks, and left the court free for the revellers to work their will.
&quot;Thou art but a cogging knave,&quot; said Sir Halbert, &quot;and well I wot, that love of ale and brandy, besides the humour of riot and frolic, would draw thee a mile, when love of my house would not bring thee a yard.
The two brothers met as brothers who loved each other fondly, yet meet rarely together.
Their mutual affection attached them to each other; but in every pursuit, habit or sentiment, connected with the discords of the times, the friend and counsellor of Murray stood opposed to the Roman Catholic priest; nor, indeed, could they have held very much society together, without giving cause of offence and suspicion to their confederates on each side.
After a close embrace on the part of both, and a welcome on that of the Abbot, Sir Halbert Glendinning expressed his satisfaction that he had come in time to appease the riot raised by Howleglas and his tumultuous followers.
The refectioner&#39;s office is ended; and such a meal as a hermit in romance can offer to a wandering knight, is all we have to set before you.
But, if you will share it with us, we shall eat it with a cheerful heart, and thank you, my brother, for your timely protection against these rude scoffers.&quot;
I intend not that he shall return to Avenel with me--it would lead to new quarrels betwixt him and my household; at least to taunts which his proud heart could ill brook, and my wish is to do him kindness.
The Knight looked after her as she departed, but turned instantly to his brother, and expressing, in the most affectionate terms, his wishes for his welfare and happiness, craved his leave to depart.
&quot;And to you, my beloved Edward,&quot; replied Glendinning, &quot;I wish the free exercise of your own free reason, and the discharge of more important duties than are connected with the idle name which you have so rashly assumed.&quot;
--&#39;May the lord of my heart,&#39; answered Balihu, the hermit of the faithful from Queda, &#39;triumph over all his foes!
&quot;So free from danger, free from fear, They cross&#39;d the court;--right glad they were, And Christabel devoutly cried To the lady by her side: &#39;Praise we the Virgin, all divine, Who hath rescued thee from this distress.&#39;
So free from danger, free from fear, They cross&#39;d the court: right glad they were ] Twice hath Roland Graeme been thus drawn into the household of Avenel by those who now hold the title.
thou wear&#39;st to manhood now, Darker lip and darker brow, Statelier step, more pensive mien, In thy face and gate are seen: Thou must now brook midnight watches, Take thy food and sport by snatches; For the gambol and the jest, Thou wert wont to love the best, Graver follies must thou follow, But as senseless, false, and hollow.
&quot;Heaven,&quot; said the dame, as she kissed her young relation, and bade him farewell, &quot;works its own work, even by the hands of those of our enemies who think themselves the strongest and the wisest.
He was delighted to think that he would have an opportunity of rejoining Catherine Seyton, whose bright eyes and lively manners had made so favourable an impression on his imagination; and, as an experienced, yet high-spirited youth, entering for the first time upon active life, his heart bounded at the thought, that he was about to see all those scenes of courtly splendour and warlike adventures, of which the followers of Sir Halbert used to boast on their occasional visits to Avenel, to the wonderment and envy of those who, like Roland, knew courts and camps only by hearsay, and were condemned to the solitary sports and almost monastic seclusion of Avenel, surrounded by its lonely lake, and embossed among its pathless mountains.
I loved the Cock of Capperlaw; the Kerrs had not an honester man in their clan, and they have had men that might have been a pattern to the Border--men that would not have lifted under twenty cows at once, and would have held themselves dishonoured if they had taken a drift of sheep, or the like, but always managed their raids in full credit and honour.--But see, his worship halts, and we are close by the bridge.
&quot;Even so,&quot; said the falconer; &quot;yonder stands Auld Reekie--you may see the smoke hover over her at twenty miles&#39; distance, as the gosshawk hangs over a plump of young wild-ducks--ay, yonder is the heart of Scotland, and each throb that she gives is felt from the edge of Solway to Duncan&#39;s-bay-head.
&quot;Was it not there,&quot; said the page in a low voice, &quot;that the Queen held her court?&quot;
Well, they may say what they will--many a true heart will be sad for Mary Stewart, e&#39;en if all be true men say of her; for look you, Master Roland--she was the loveliest creature to look upon that I ever saw with eye, and no lady in the land liked better the fair flight of a falcon.

</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The noise and cries thus arising on the Highgate, as it was called, drew into the quarrel two or three other parties of gentlemen and their servants, besides some single passengers, who, hearing a fray betwixt these two distinguished names, took part in it, either for love or hatred.
Look you, there is scarce a woman walks this High-gate with a silk screen or a pearlin muffler, but, as I said before, she has either gentleman-usher before her, or kinsman, or lover, or husband, at her elbow, or it may be a brace of stout fellows with sword and buckler, not so far behind but what they can follow close--But you heed me no more than a goss-hawk minds a yellow yoldring.&quot;
The latter part of Adam Woodcock&#39;s sage remonstrance had been in a great measure lost upon Roland, for whose benefit it was intended; because, in one of the female forms which tripped along the street, muffled in a veil of striped silk, like the women of Brussels at this day, his eye had discerned something which closely resembled the exquisite shape and spirited bearing of Catherine Seyton.--During all the grave advice which the falconer was dinning in his ears, his eye continued intent upon so interesting an object of observation; and at length, as the damsel, just about to dive under one of the arched passages which afforded an outlet to the Canongate from the houses beneath, (a passage, graced by a projecting shield of arms, supported by two huge foxes of stone,) had lifted her veil for the purpose perhaps of descrying who the horseman was who for some time had eyed her so closely, young Roland saw, under the shade of the silken plaid, enough of the bright azure eyes, fair locks, and blithe features, to induce him, like an inexperienced and rash madcap, whose wilful ways never had been traversed by contradiction, nor much subjected to consideration, to throw the bridle of his horse into Adam Woodcock&#39;s hand, and leave him to play the waiting gentleman, while he dashed down the paved court after Catherine Seyton--all as aforesaid.
Catherine fled across a paved court, decorated with large formal vases of stone, in which yews, cypresses, and other evergreens, vegetated in sombre sullenness, and gave a correspondent degree of solemnity to the high and heavy building in front of which they were placed as ornaments, aspiring towards a square portion of the blue hemisphere, corresponding exactly in extent to the quadrangle in which they were stationed, and all around which rose huge black walls, exhibiting windows in rows of five stories, with heavy architraves over each, bearing armorial and religious devices.
Through this court Catherine Seyton flashed like a hunted doe, making the best use of those pretty legs which had attracted the commendation even of the reflective and cautious Adam Woodcock.
She hastened towards a large door in the centre of the lower front of the court, pulled the bobbin till the latch flew up, and ensconced herself in the ancient mansion.
But, if she fled like a doe, Roland Graeme followed with the speed and ardour of a youthful stag-hound, loosed for the first time on his prey.
In short, he saw the waving of her screen, or veil, at one corner, heard the tap of her foot, light as that was, as it crossed the court, and caught a glimpse of her figure just as she entered the door of the mansion.
With no little pride Roland Graeme accepted the gift, which he hastily fastened around his bonnet, as he had seen gallants wear such an ornament, and renewing his obeisance to the Baron, left the hall, traversed the court, and appeared in the street, just as Adam Woodcock, vexed and anxious at his delay, had determined to leave the horses to their fate, and go in quest of his youthful comrade.
&quot;Thou seest I have got one on shorter acquaintance with the city,&quot; answered the page, &quot;but set thine honest heart at rest; that which is fairly won and freely given, is neither reft nor stolen.&quot;
&quot;Ay, marry, is it!&quot;
Here the hoary statesman, with his cautious yet commanding look, his furred cloak and sable pantoufles; there the soldier in buff and steel, his long sword jarring against the pavement, and his whiskered upper lip and frowning brow, looking an habitual defiance of danger, which perhaps was not always made good; there again passed my lord&#39;s serving-man, high of heart, and bloody of hand, humble to his master and his master&#39;s equals, insolent to all others.
To these might be added, the poor suitor, with his anxious look and depressed mien--the officer, full of his brief authority, elbowing his betters, and possibly his benefactors, out of the road--the proud priest, who sought a better benefice--the proud baron, who sought a grant of church lands--the robber chief, who came to solicit a pardon for the injuries he had inflicted on his neighbors--the plundered franklin, who came to seek vengeance for that which he had himself received.
As, tired of the eager and enraptured attention which the page gave to a scene so new to him, Adam Woodcock endeavoured to get him to move forward, before his exuberance of astonishment should attract the observation of the sharp-witted denizens of the court, the falconer himself became an object of attention to a gay menial in a dark-green bonnet and feather, with a cloak of a corresponding colour, laid down, as the phrase then went, by six broad bars of silver lace, and welted with violet and silver.
Adam Woodcock at court!&quot;
While he thus spoke, he led the way to a side door which opened into the court; and threading several dark passages with the air of one who knew the most secret recesses of the palace, conducted them to a small matted chamber, where he placed bread and cheese and a foaming flagon of ale before the falconer and his young companion, who immediately did justice to the latter in a hearty draught, which nearly emptied the measure.
And the Earl of Morton replied--now I pray you, Adam, to notice, that I say this out of love to you and your lord, and also for old comradeship, and also because Sir Halbert hath done me good, and may again--and also because I love not the Earl of Morton, as indeed more fear than like him--so then it were a foul deed in you to betray me.--&#39;But,&#39; said the Earl to the Regent, &#39;take heed, my lord, you trust not this Glendinning too far--he comes of churl&#39;s blood, which was never true to the nobles&#39;--by Saint Andrew, these were his very words.--&#39;And besides,&#39; he said, &#39;he hath a brother, a monk in Saint Mary&#39;s, and walks all by his guidance, and is making friends on the Border with Buccleuch and with Ferniehirst, [Footnote: Both these Border Chieftains were great friends of Queen Mary.]
Roland Graeme&#39;s heart throbbed when he found himself so unexpectedly in the scene of Rizzio&#39;s slaughter, a catastrophe which had chilled with horror all even in that rude age, which had been the theme of wonder and pity through every cottage and castle in Scotland, and had not escaped that of Avenel.
Thou hast been five minutes in the court, and hast employed thy time so well, as to make a powerful and a mortal enemy out of the usher of the council-chamber.
&quot;Ay,&quot; replied Morton, &quot;even thus fly all your shafts--smartly enough loosened from the bow, and not unskilfully aimed--but a breath of foolish affection ever crosses in the mid volley, and sways the arrow from the mark.&quot;
&quot;Say not so, Morton,&quot; replied Murray, &quot;I have both dared and done--&quot; &quot;Yes, enough to gain, but not enough to keep--reckon not that she will think and act thus--you have wounded her deeply, both in pride and in power--it signifies nought, that you would tent now the wound with unavailing salves--as matters stand with you, you must forfeit the title of an affectionate brother, to hold that of a bold and determined statesman.&quot;
Your favourite Sir Halbert, my Lord of Murray, has as much fraternal affection as yourself.&quot;
&quot;That is something,&quot; replied Morton; &quot;but yet in fair love and goodwill, I must still pray you to keep on your guard.
The man of office then briefly acquainted them that this would be their residence till his Grace&#39;s farther orders; that they were to go to the pantry, to the buttery, to the cellar, and to the kitchen, at the usual hours, to receive the allowances becoming their station,--instructions which Adam Woodcock&#39;s old familiarity with the court made him perfectly understand--&quot;For your beds,&quot; he said, &quot;you must go to the hostelry of Saint Michael&#39;s, in respect the palace is now full of the domestics of the greater nobles.&quot;
On the contrary, he felt like one who looks on a romantic landscape, of which he sees the features for the first time, and then obscured with mist and driving tempest.
A groom followed with bread, salt, and the other means of setting forth a meal; and when they had both placed on the oaken table what they bore in their hands, the falconer observed, that since he knew the court, it had got harder and harder every day to the poor gentlemen and yeoman retainers, but that now it was an absolute flaying of a flea for the hide and tallow.
&quot;To the hostelrie of Saint Michael&#39;s, then, with all my heart,&quot; said the page; and they left the palace accordingly, rendered to the sentinels at the gate, who had now taken their posts for the evening, a strict account of their names and business, were dismissed through a small wicket of the close-barred portal, and soon reached the inn or hostelrie of Saint Michael, which stood in a large court-yard, off the main street, close under the descent of the Calton-hill.
The sage Adam Woodcock, who was in a sort of languid degree amused with the page&#39;s exclamations, even while he professed to despise them, became at length rather desirous to set his tongue once more a-going, that he might enjoy the superiority afforded by his own intimate familiarity with all the circumstances which excited in his young companion&#39;s mind so much wonderment.
&quot;Do,&quot; said the gallant squire, &quot;and if you bring me to him, you shall have a groat to-night, and a kiss on Sunday when you have on a cleaner kirtle.&quot;
&quot;Marry that I will, in any Christian court,&quot; said the other page.
And then, in defiance of the young Drawcansir&#39;s threats, with a stout heart and dauntless accent, he again uplifted the stave.
Here are you sent with me, to prevent my innocent youth getting into snares----&quot; &quot;I wish your innocent youth were cut short with a halter, with all my heart,&quot; said Adam, who began to see which way the admonition tended.
&quot;Marry, amen, and with all my heart,&quot; said Adam; &quot;out upon my folly for expecting any thing but impertinent raillery from a page like thee, that if he saw his father in a scrape, would laugh at him, instead of lending him aid.
&quot;And thou wilt be in heart to sing thy jolly ballad about the Pope,&quot; said his comrade.
During his absence the falconer took the page by the hand--&quot;May I never hood hawk again,&quot; said the good-natured fellow, &quot;if I am not as sorry to part with you as if you were a child of mine own, craving pardon for the freedom--I cannot tell what makes me love you so much, unless it be for the reason that I loved the vicious devil of a brown galloway nag whom my master the Knight called Satan, till Master Warden changed his name to Seyton; for he said it was over boldness to call a beast after the King of Darkness----&quot; &quot;And,&quot; said the page, &quot;it was over boldness in him, I trow, to call a vicious brute after a noble family.&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; proceeded Adam, &quot;Seyton or Satan, I loved that nag over every other horse in the stable---There was no sleeping on his back--he was for ever fidgeting, bolting, rearing, biting, kicking, and giving you work to do, and maybe the measure of your back on the heather to the boot of it all.
And I think I love you better than any lad in the castle, for the self-same qualities.&quot;
Every hoof-tread seemed to tap upon Roland&#39;s heart as he heard his comrade withdraw with so little of his usual alert activity, and felt that he was once more alone in the world.
&quot;Name it as you list,&quot; replied Lindesay; &quot;had the Regent desired to send an envoy capable to speak to a captive Queen, there are many gallants in his court who would have courted the occasion to make speeches out of Amadis of Gaul, or the Mirror of Knighthood.
Could valour aught avail or people&#39;s love, France had not wept Navarre&#39;s brave Henry slain; If wit or beauty could compassion move, The rose of Scotland had not wept in vain.
As she was of noble birth (being a daughter of the house of Mar) and of great beauty, her intimacy with James did not prevent her being afterwards sought in honourable marriage by many gallants of the time, among whom she had preferred Sir William Douglas of Lochleven.
&quot;Had James done to her,&quot; she said, in her secret heart, &quot;the justice he owed her, she had seen in her son, as a source of unmixed delight and of unchastened pride, the lawful monarch of Scotland, and one of the ablest who ever swayed the sceptre.&quot;
The House of Mar, not inferior in antiquity or grandeur to that of Drummond, would then have also boasted a Queen among its daughters, and escaped the stain attached to female frailty, even when it has a royal lover for its apology.
Lady Lochleven disliked her as the daughter of Mary of Guise, the legal possessor of those rights over James&#39;s heart and hand, of which she conceived herself to have been injuriously deprived; and yet more so as the professor of a religion which she detested worse than Paganism.
We know that by far the most acute of those who, in latter days, have adopted the unfavourable view of Mary&#39;s character, longed, like the executioner before his dreadful task was performed, to kiss the fair hand of her on whom he was about to perform so horrible a duty.
But be of good cheer; the crown of Scotland has many a fair manor, and your affectionate son, and my no less affectionate brother, will endow the good knight your husband with the best of them, ere Mary should be dismissed from this hospitable castle from your ladyship&#39;s lack of means to support the charges.&quot;
but, my dear Lochleven,&quot; said the Queen, &quot;you are over scrupulous--I pray you accept of a goodly manor; what should support the Queen of Scotland in this her princely court, saving her own crown-lands--and who should minister to the wants of a mother, save an affectionate son like the Earl of Murray, who possesses so wonderfully both the power and inclination?--Or said you it was the danger of the task which clouded your smooth and hospitable brow?--No doubt, a page is a formidable addition to my body-guard of females; and I bethink me it must have been for that reason that my Lord of Lindesay refused even now to venture within the reach of a force so formidable, without being attended by a competent retinue.&quot;
You, young man,&quot; she proceeded, addressing Roland Graeme, and at once softening the ironical sharpness of her manner into good-humoured raillery, &quot;you, who are all our male attendance, from our Lord High Chamberlain down to our least galopin, follow us to prepare our court.&quot;
When he entered, he saw that the Queen had thrown herself into the large chair which stood nearest the door, and was sobbing for breath in a strong fit of hysterical affection.
She cast on Roland a glance which might have melted a heart of stone.
Yet such was the engrossing effect of Mary&#39;s presence, that it surmounted for the moment even the feelings of a youthful lover; and it was not until Catherine Seyton had disappeared, that Roland began to consider in what relation they were to stand to each other.
it is, methinks, somewhat a singular ornament for a court, though I am, as I well need to be, too much of a Stuart to fear a sword.&quot;
&quot;Possibly, my lord,&quot; replied the Queen, &quot;it may have done service to my ancestors--Your ancestors were men of loyalty&quot; &quot;Ay, madam,&quot; replied he, &quot;service it hath done; but such as kings love neither to acknowledge nor to reward.
Lord Ruthven had the look and bearing which became a soldier and a statesman, and the martial cast of his form and features procured him the popular epithet of Greysteil, by which he was distinguished by his intimates, after the hero of a metrical romance then generally known.
She returned, however, with grace the salutation of Lord Ruthven, and extended her hand to George Douglas, who kneeled, and kissed it with respect; the first mark of a subject&#39;s homage which Roland Graeme had seen any of them render to the captive Sovereign.
&quot;Wherefore,&quot; the instrument proceeded, &quot;we, of the motherly affection we bear to our said son, have renounced and demitted, and by these our letters of free good-will, renounce and demit, the Crown, government, and guiding of the realm of Scotland, in favour of our said son, that he may succeed to us as native Prince thereof, as much as if we had been removed by disease, and not by our own proper act.
&quot;And is this _all_ my loving subjects require of me, my lord?&quot;
&quot;We need look for no farther proof,&quot; replied the stern Lord Ruthven, &quot;than the shameless marriage betwixt the widow of the murdered and the leader of the band of murderers!--They that joined hands in the fated month of May, had already united hearts and counsel in the deed which preceded that marriage but a few brief weeks.&quot;
Methinks, were it carefully examined, we should see that the names of Morton and of Lindesay, and of Ruthven, may be found in that bond, which pressed me to marry that unhappy man.--Ah!
After giving way to a passionate burst of sorrow, she at length said to Melville, &quot;Kneel not to me, Melville--mock me not with the homage of the person, when the heart is far away--Why stay you behind with the deposed, the condemned?
&quot;Madam,&quot; said Sir Robert Melville, &quot;so help me Heaven at my need, my heart is as true to you as when you were in your highest place.&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;Madam,&quot; said Roland Graeme, &quot;if it pleases you that I should do so, I will presently swim through the lake, if they refuse me other conveyance to the shore; I will go to the courts successively of England, France, and Spain, and will show you have subscribed these vile instruments from no stronger impulse than the fear of death, and I will do battle against them that say otherwise.&quot;
The Queen turned her round, and with one of those sweet smiles which, during the era of life&#39;s romance, overpay every risk, held her hand towards Roland, but without &quot;speaking a word.
He kneeled reverently, and kissed it, and Melville again resumed his plea.
At length, as if moved by a sudden impulse, he walked round the table which had hitherto been betwixt them and the Queen, kneeled on one knee, took her hand, kissed it, let it fall, and arose--&quot;Lady,&quot; he said, &quot;thou art a noble creature, even though thou hast abused God&#39;s choicest gifts.
Apparently, she was determined to disturb his self-possession, if possible; for, while in the act of bathing her hands, she contrived, as it were by accident, to flirt some drops of water upon the face of the assiduous assistant.
&quot;But, Catherine, thou hast used thy brief space at court well, to remember what George Douglas was then.&quot;
&quot;She will challenge the other court lady,&quot; thought Roland Graeme; &quot;she will to a certainty fling down her glove, and if Dame Mary Fleming hath but the soul to lift it, we may have a combat in the lists!&quot;
But I am glad you are not angry with me in sincerity,&quot; casting herself as she spoke into the arms of her friend, and continuing, with a tone of apologetic fondness, while she kissed her on either side of the face; &quot;you know, my dear Fleming, that I have to contend with both my father&#39;s lofty pride, and with my mother&#39;s high spirit--God bless them!
Dame Mary Fleming&#39;s sense of dignity, and love of form, could not resist this affectionate appeal.
She kissed Catherine Seyton in her turn affectionately; while, answering the last part of her speech, she said, &quot;Now Our Lady forbid, dear Catherine, that you should lose aught that is beseeming of what becomes so well your light heart and lively humour.
When she had made two or three steps towards the door, however, she turned back, and advancing to the young couple whom she left together, she said, in a very serious though a low tone, &quot;I trust it is impossible that we can, any of us, or in any circumstances, forget, that, few as we are, we form the household of the Queen of Scotland; and that, in her calamity, all boyish mirth and childish jesting can only serve to give a great triumph to her enemies, who have already found their account in objecting to her the lightness of every idle folly, that the young and the gay practised in her court.&quot;
Catherine Seyton seemed much struck with this remonstrance--She suffered herself to drop into the seat which she had quitted when she went to embrace Dame Mary Fleming, and for some time rested her brow upon her hands; while Roland Graeme looked at her earnestly, with a mixture of emotions which perhaps he himself could neither have analysed nor explained.
The steward remained motionless as some old picture, while the domestics did their office; and when it was accomplished, every thing removed from the table, and the board itself taken from its tressels and disposed against the wall, he said aloud, without addressing any one in particular, and somewhat in the tone of a herald reading a proclamation, &quot;My noble lady, Dame Margaret Erskine, by marriage Douglas, lets the Lady Mary of Scotland and her attendants to wit, that a servant of the true evangele, her reverend chaplain, will to-night, as usual, expound, lecture, and catechise, according to the forms of the congregation of gospellers.&quot;
&quot;No wonder,&quot; he thought, &quot;if, courted by the son of a proud and powerful baron, she can no longer spare a word or look to the poor fortuneless page.&quot;
In a word, Roland Graeme&#39;s situation became truly disagreeable, and his heart naturally enough rebelled against the injustice of this treatment, which deprived him of the only comfort which he had received for submitting to a confinement in other respects irksome.
&quot;I suppose you mean Catherine Seyton,&quot; said the page, his heart rising as he spoke; &quot;but she is herself fifty times more variable in her humour than the very water which we are floating upon.&quot;
The flush which passed over Douglas&#39;s face, made the page aware that he had alighted on a truth, when he was, in fact, speaking at random; and the feeling that he had done so, was like striking a dagger into his own heart.
&quot;No, my poor boy,&quot; replied the Queen; &quot;but as you numbered up the lakes and rivers of my kingdom, imagination cheated me, as it will do, and snatched me from these dreary walls away to the romantic streams of Nithsdale, and the royal towers of Lochmaben.--O land, which my fathers have so long ruled!
Oh, Roland, from what an enterprise you are now withdrawing your heart and hand, through mere fickleness and coldness of spirit!&quot;
&quot;I think not so ill of the Earl of Murray,&quot; said Roland Graeme; &quot;and sooth to speak,&quot; he added, with a smile, &quot;it would require some bribe to make me embrace, with firm and desperate resolution, either one side or the other.&quot;
Your country will thank you--your Queen will be debtor to you--you will achieve at once the highest from the lowest degree in chivalry--all men will honour, all women will love you--and I, sworn with you so early to the accomplishment of Queen Mary&#39;s freedom, will--yes, I will--love you better than--ever sister loved brother!&quot;
And as she spoke she approached her finger to the brow of the astonished youth, and, without touching it, signed the cross over his forehead--stooped her face towards him, and seemed to kiss the empty space in which she had traced the symbol; then starting up, and extricating herself from his grasp, darted into the Queen&#39;s apartment.
And when love&#39;s torch hath set the heart in flame, Comes Seignor Reason, with his saws and cautions, Giving such aid as the old gray-beard Sexton, Who from the church-vault drags the crazy engine, To ply its dribbling ineffectual streamlet Against a conflagration.
You are here in the service of a lady, honourable as touching her birth, deserving of all compassion as respects her misfortunes, and garnished with even but too many of those outward qualities which win men&#39;s regard and affection.
During my long residence in this house she hath not deigned to see me in private, or to hear my doctrine; yet so may Heaven prosper my labours, as love for her soul, and desire to bring her into the right path, was my chief desire for coming hither.&quot;
&quot;Your acquaintance hath not been much, I think, with courts or princes,&quot; continued the young Esquire.
&quot;Madam,&quot; said the preacher, &quot;it is not to the talents or skill of the husbandman that God gives the increase--the words which were offered in vain by him whom you justly call our apostle, during the bustle and gaiety of a court, may yet find better acceptance during the leisure for reflection which this place affords.
God knows, lady, that I speak in singleness of heart, as one who would as soon compare himself to the immortal angels, as to the holy man whom you have named.
We are sick at heart, and may not now be disposed with farther controversy--and thou, Roland, take this little purse;&quot; (then, turning to the divine, she said, showing its contents,) &quot;Look, reverend sir,--it contains only these two or three gold testoons, a coin which, though bearing my own poor features, I have ever found more active against me than on my side, just as my subjects take arms against me, with my own name for their summons and signal.--Take this purse, that thou mayest want no means of amusement.
we cannot wonder that his heart beat, high with hope and curiosity, at the prospect of partaking the sport even of a country wake.
You young fellows of the sword desire to wrestle, fence, or so forth, with some expert adversary; and for my part, I love to match myself for life or death against that same Plague.&quot;
The itinerant minstrel found himself deserted by the audience he had collected, even in the most interesting passage of the romance which he recited, and just as he was sending about his boy, with bonnet in hand, to collect their oblations.
&quot;You can switch men&#39;s eyes out of their heads, as well as the heart out of their bosoms.&quot;
The damsel, unallured by his praises, still kept aloof, and sung with gaiety a verse from an old ballad, &quot;Oh, some do call me Jack, sweet love, And some do call me Gill; But when I ride to Holyrood, My name is Wilful Will.&quot;
&quot;I seek,&quot; said the page, with much embarrassment; &quot;I seek--&quot; But his answer was cut short, when the old woman, drawing her huge gray eyebrows sternly together, with a frown which knitted her brow into a thousand wrinkles, arose, and erecting herself up to her full natural size, tore the kerchief from her head, and seizing Roland by the arm, made two strides across the floor of the apartment to a small window through which the light fell full on her face, and showed the astonished youth the countenance of Magdalen Graeme.--&quot;Yes, Roland,&quot; she said, &quot;thine eyes deceive thee not; they show thee truly the features of her whom thou hast thyself deceived, whose wine thou hast turned into gall, her bread of joyfulness into bitter poison, her hope into the blackest despair--it is she who now demands of thee, what seekest thou here?--She whose heaviest sin towards Heaven hath been, that she loved thee even better than the weal of the whole church, and could not without reluctance surrender thee even in the cause of God--she now asks you, what seekest thou here?&quot;
He was therefore silent; and Magdalen Graeme proceeded with increasing enthusiasm in her apostrophe--&quot;Once more, what seek&#39;st thou, false boy?--seek&#39;st thou the honour thou hast renounced, the faith thou hast abandoned, the hopes thou hast destroyed?--Or didst thou seek me, the sole protectress of thy youth, the only parent whom thou hast known, that thou mayest trample on my gray hairs, even as thou hast already trampled on the best wishes of my heart?&quot;
The love of Catherine Seyton will follow him only who shall achieve the freedom of her mistress; and believe, it may be one day in thine own power to be that happy lover.
Cast, therefore, away doubt and fear, and prepare to do what religion calls for, what thy country demands of thee, what thy duty as a subject and as a servant alike require at your hand; and be assured, even the idlest or wildest wishes of thy heart will be most readily attained by following the call of thy duty.&quot;
&quot;Now, by the love I once bore thee,&quot; said the matron, &quot;I could slay thee with mine own hand, when I hear thee talk of a dearer faith being due to rebels and heretics, than thou owest to thy church and thy prince!&quot;
Roland Graeme&#39;s kindness of heart was at least equal to his vivacity of temper--he could not bear to see his ancient and honoured master and spiritual guide in a situation which inferred a change of fortune so melancholy, but throwing himself at his feet, grasped his knees and wept aloud.
For the present, the shepherd is smitten--ay, well-nigh to the earth--the flock are scattered, and the shrines of saints and martyrs, and pious benefactors to the church, are given to the owls of night, and the satyrs of the desert.&quot;
my son, believe not that, worn out with woes, and bent more by affliction than by years, I have forgotten the effect of beauty over the heart of youth.
But thus it is--Heaven works its purposes through human folly; and Douglas&#39;s ambitious affection, as well as thine, shall contribute alike to the desired end.&quot;
&quot;How, my father,&quot; said the page, &quot;my suspicions are then true!--Douglas loves----&quot; &quot;He does; and with a love as much misplaced as thine own; but beware of him--cross him not--thwart him not.&quot;
What have you required of me, that I have not granted unresistingly, though with an aching heart?&quot;
&quot;Follow the good father, Roland,&quot; said the Abbot, &quot;and remember my words--a day is approaching that will try the temper of all true Scotsmen--may thy heart prove faithful as the steel of thy blade!&quot;
Since I must choose betwixt aiding and betraying her, I will decide as becomes her servant and her subject; but Catherine Seyton--Catherine Seyton, beloved by Douglas and holding me on or off as the intervals of her leisure or caprice will permit--how shall I deal with the coquette?--By heaven, when I next have an opportunity, she shall render me some reason for her conduct, or I will break with her for ever!&quot;
Your boatmen lie on their oars, and there have already been made two wefts from the warder&#39;s turret to intimate that those in the castle are impatient for your return.
&quot;I trust, amid yonder idle fooleries, there wanted not some pouring forth of doctrine to a better purpose than that vain mirth, which, blazing and vanishing like the crackling of dry thorns, leaves to the fools who love it nothing but dust and ashes.&quot;
&quot;It must be by his aid that she is thus enabled, like a phantom, to transport herself from place to place, and to appear at pleasure on the mainland or on the islet.--It must be so,&quot; he repeated once more; &quot;with him she holds a close, secret, and intimate correspondence, altogether inconsistent with the eye of favour which she has sometimes cast upon me, and destructive to the hopes which she must have known these glances have necessarily inspired.&quot;
And yet (for love will hope where reason despairs) the thought rushed on his mind, that it was possible she only encouraged Douglas&#39;s passion so far as might serve her mistress&#39;s interest, and that she was of too frank, noble, and candid a nature, to hold out to himself hopes which she meant not to fulfil.
At length the light was removed or extinguished, and that object of speculation was also withdrawn from the eyes of the meditative lover.
Dare I confess the fact, without injuring his character for ever as a hero of romance?
Sleep, like other earthly blessings, is niggard of its favours when most courted.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;Wretched boy,&quot; said the distracted Lady of Lochleven, &quot;hast thou fallen even thus far into the snare of this Moabitish woman?--hast thou bartered thy name, thy allegiance, thy knightly oath, thy duty to thy parents, thy country, and thy God, for a feigned tear, or a sickly smile, from lips which flattered the infirm Francis--lured to death the idiot Darnley--read luscious poetry with the minion Chastelar--mingled in the lays of love which were sung by the beggar Rizzio--and which were joined in rapture to those of the foul and licentious Bothwell?&quot;
Well you deserve that each of your lieges should die for you; but I have done more--have done that to which love alone could compel a Douglas--I have dissembled.
Farewell, then, Queen of all hearts, and Empress of that of Douglas!--When you are freed from this vile bondage--as freed you shall be, if justice remains in Heaven--and when you load with honours and titles the happy man who shall deliver you, cast one thought on him whose heart would have despised every reward for a kiss of your hand--cast one thought on his fidelity, and drop one tear on his grave.&quot;
exclaimed the Lady of Lochleven--&quot;wilt thou court thy adulterous paramour before the eyes of a parent?--Tear them asunder, and put him under strict ward!
The enthusiasm of his onset was too sudden and too lively to have been opposed by any thing short of the most decided opposition; and as he was both loved and feared by his father&#39;s vassals, none of them would offer him actual injury.
exclaimed the Queen--&quot;Oh, true and noble heart, that prefers death to imprisonment!&quot;
said the Lady; &quot;who ever knew so well as thou to deal the deepest wounds under the pretence of kindness and courtesy?--Who, since the great traitor, could ever so betray with a kiss?&quot;
My eldest son is a widower--were he not more worthy the flattering hopes with which you have seduced his brother?--True, the yoke of marriage has been already thrice fitted on--but the church of Rome calls it a sacrament, and its votaries may deem it one in which they cannot too often participate.&quot;
&quot;And the votaries of the church of Geneva,&quot; replied Mary, colouring with indignation, &quot;as they deem marriage _no_ sacrament, are said at times to dispense with the holy ceremony.&quot;
&quot;I will show you my esteem is less selfish than ye think for,&quot; said the page; &quot;for I hold truth and mirth to be better than gravity and cunning--ay, and in the end to be a match for them.--You never loved me less, Sir Steward, than you do at this moment.
Graeme, thus left alone, busied himself as one engaged in a labour of love, to imitate, as well as he could, the grace and courtesy with which George of Douglas was wont to render his ceremonial service at meals to the Queen of Scotland.
Roland Graeme approached her with beating heart and with down-cast eyes, and asked her, in a low and hesitating voice, whether the Queen were well?
&quot;Think you her heart and body are framed of steel and iron, to endure the cruel disappointment of yester even, and the infamous taunts of yonder puritanic hag?--Would to God that I were a man, to aid her more effectually!&quot;
&quot;And so we meant; but who could have guessed that Master Page should choose to pass all night in the garden, like some moon-stricken knight in a Spanish romance--instead of being in his bed-room, when Douglas came to hold communication with him on our project.&quot;
&quot;In the second place, as I said before, there is one foolish person among us, who believes that Roland Graeme&#39;s heart is warm, though his head is giddy--that his blood is pure, though it boils too hastily--and that his faith and honour are true as the load-star, though his tongue sometimes is far less than discreet.&quot;
This avowal Catherine repeated in a low tone, with her eye fixed on the floor, as if she shunned the glance of Roland while she suffered it to escape her lips--&quot;And this single friend,&quot; exclaimed the youth in rapture; &quot;this only one who would do justice to the poor Roland Graeme, and whose own generous heart taught her to distinguish between follies of the brain and faults of the heart--Will you not tell me, dearest Catherine, to whom I owe my most grateful, my most heartfelt thanks?&quot;
&quot;Nay,&quot; said Catherine, with her eyes still fixed on the ground, &quot;if your own heart tell you not----&quot; &quot;Dearest Catherine!&quot;
&quot;If your own heart, I say, tell you not,&quot; said Catherine, gently disengaging her hand, &quot;it is very ungrateful; for since the maternal kindness of the Lady Fleming----&quot; The page started on his feet.
You know the Lady Fleming has no more regard for any one, than hath the forlorn princess who is wrought into yonder piece of old figured court tapestry.&quot;
&quot;Nay, but, fair Catherine,&quot; said the page, &quot;why will you thus damp my ardour, when I am devoting myself, body and soul, to the cause of your mistress?&quot;
Believe me,&quot; she said, with kindling eyes, and while the blood mantled on her cheek, &quot;they think vilely and falsely of women--I mean of those who deserve the name--who deem that they love the gratification of their vanity, or the mean purpose of engrossing a lover&#39;s admiration and affection, better than they love the virtue and honour of the man they may be brought to prefer.
He that serves his religion, his prince, and his country, with ardour and devotion, need not plead his cause with the commonplace rant of romantic passion--the woman whom he honours with his love becomes his debtor, and her corresponding affection is engaged to repay his glorious toil.&quot;
&quot;Only a heart which knows how to value it,&quot; said Catherine.
&quot;He that should free this injured Princess from these dungeons, and set her at liberty among her loyal and warlike nobles, whose hearts are burning to welcome her--where is the maiden in Scotland whom the love of such a hero would not honour, were she sprung from the blood royal of the land, and he the offspring of the poorest cottager that ever held a plough?&quot;
But one thing is clear, that in this captivity she hath wrong--She rendered herself up, on a capitulation, and the terms have been refused her--I will embrace her quarrel to the death!&quot;
And know, fair Catherine,--for you shall see the very secret thought of my heart,--that not Honour only--not only that other and fairer sister, whom you frown on me for so much as mentioning--but the stern commands of duty also, compel me to aid the Queen&#39;s deliverance.&quot;
But shame on this faintness of heart!
As she stepped over the threshold of her apartment, Catherine, hastily drying her tears, ran to meet her royal mistress, and having first kneeled at her feet, and kissed her hand, instantly rose, and placing herself on the other side of the Queen, seemed anxious to divide with the Lady Fleming the honour of supporting and assisting her.
Hers was not the female heart which could refuse compassion, at least, to a gallant youth who had suffered in her cause, although he had been guided in his enterprise by a too presumptuous passion; and the words &quot;Poor Douglas!&quot;
said the Queen, &quot;what needs this, Catherine?--why prepare new victims to be involved in, and overwhelmed by, my cruel fortune?--were we not better cease to struggle, and ourselves sink in the tide without farther resistance, than thus drag into destruction with us every generous heart which makes an effort in our favour?--I have had but too much of plot and intrigue around me, since I was stretched an orphan child in my very cradle, while contending nobles strove which should rule in the name of the unconscious innocent.
Mary raised herself in her chair, and sat erect, while, extending one hand to be kissed by the page, she arranged with the other the clustering locks which shaded the bold yet lovely brow of the high-spirited Catherine.
but that bridegroom shall have the barony of Blairgowrie, a fair gift even for a Queen to give, and that bride&#39;s chaplet shall be twined with the fairest pearls that ever were found in the depths of Lochlomond; and thou thyself, Mary Fleming, the best dresser of tires that ever busked the tresses of a Queen, and who would scorn to touch those of any woman of lower rank,--thou thyself shalt, for my love, twine them into the bride&#39;s tresses.--Look, my Fleming, suppose them such clustered locks as those of our Catherine, they would not put shame upon thy skill.&quot;
With a face deadly pale, and a mien as if she were about to sink into the earth, the court-bred dame, no longer daring to refuse obedience, faltered out--&quot;Gracious Lady--if my memory err not--it was at a masque in Holyrood--at the marriage of Sebastian.&quot;
&quot;We will take the field ourself,&quot; she said; &quot;warn the city--warn Lothian and Fife--saddle our Spanish barb, and bid French Paris see our petronel be charged!--Better to die at the head of our brave Scotsmen, like our grandfather at Flodden, than of a broken heart, like our ill-starred father!&quot;
&quot;For God&#39;s love, madam, be patient!&quot;
&quot;Oh, the Lady Fleming, the Lady Fleming,&quot; said Catherine, repeating the words impatiently; &quot;the Lady Fleming is a fool--she loves her mistress, yet knows so little how to express her love, that were the Queen to ask her for very poison, she would deem it a point of duty not to resist her commands.
I could have torn her starched head-tire from her formal head--The Queen should have as soon had the heart out of my body, as the word Sebastian out of my lips--That that piece of weaved tapestry should be a woman, and yet not have wit enough to tell a lie!&quot;
&quot;You are as great a fool as Fleming,&quot; returned the impatient maiden; &quot;know ye not, that on the night of Henry Darnley&#39;s murder, and at the blowing up of the Kirk of Field, the Queen&#39;s absence was owing to her attending on a masque at Holyrood, given by her to grace the marriage of this same Sebastian, who, himself a favoured servant, married one of her female attendants, who was near to her person?&quot;
wily tempter, I will wrestle with thee strongly, and with better suggestions than my own evil heart can supply!&quot;
Fools asked her for charms to make them beloved, misers for means to increase their store; some demanded to know the future--an idle wish, since it cannot be altered; others would have an explanation of the past--idler still, since it cannot be recalled.
&quot;To redeem the insulted honour of my master&#39;s house, I mixed the contents of the packet with the jar of succory-water: They seldom fail to drain it, and the woman loves it over all.&quot;
&quot;The hag asked me which I chose--I told her I loved a slow and sure revenge.
Is she not the daughter of the wretched tyrant James, whom Heaven cast down from his kingdom, and his pride, even as the king of Babylon was smitten?&quot;
said the Lady--a thousand varied recollections thronging on her mind at the mention of her royal lover&#39;s name; &quot;Peace, and disturb not the ashes of the dead--of the royal, of the unhappy dead.
I saw with a dry eye the apostacy and shame of George Douglas, the hope of my son&#39;s house--the child of my love; and yet I now weep for him who has so long lain in his grave--for him to whom I owe it that his daughter can make a scoffing and a jest of my name!
But she is _his_ daughter--my heart, hardened against her for so many causes, relents when a glance of her eye places her father unexpectedly before me--and as often her likeness to that true daughter of the house of Guise, her detested mother, has again confirmed my resolution.
The Lady of Lochleven was not aware how far minds of a certain gloomy and determined cast by nature, may be warped by a keen sense of petty injuries and insults, combining with the love of gain, and sense of self-interest, and amalgamated with the crude, wild, and indigested fanatical opinions which this man had gathered among the crazy sectaries of Germany; or how far the doctrines of fatalism, which he had embraced so decidedly, sear the human conscience, by representing our actions as the result of inevitable necessity.
Catherine kneeled by the side of the Queen&#39;s bed, and, kissing her hand repeatedly, succeeded at last in awakening without alarming her.
&quot;We cannot do better,&quot; she said, after her hasty conference with Catherine, pressing her at the same time to her bosom, and kissing her forehead; &quot;we cannot do better than to follow the scheme so happily devised by thy quick wit and bold affection.
her memory is at Holyrood, though her body is at Lochleven.--Forgive, madam,&quot; continued the Lady, &quot;if I call your attention to me--I am Margaret Erskine, of the house of Mar, by marriage Lady Douglas of Lochleven.&quot;
&quot;Her words go like a knife through my heart,&quot; said the Lady of Lochleven--&quot;With a breaking heart, I pray your Grace to tell me what is your ailment, that aid may be had, if there be yet time.&quot;
&quot;Nay, my ailment,&quot; replied the Queen, &quot;is nothing worth telling, or worth a leech&#39;s notice--my limbs feel heavy--my heart feels cold--a prisoner&#39;s limbs and heart are rarely otherwise--fresh air, methinks, and freedom, would soon revive me; but as the Estates have ordered it, death alone can break my prison-doors.&quot;
madam,&quot; said the Lady Fleming, who conceived the time propitious to show that her own address had been held too lightly of; &quot;it is but trying what good freedom may work upon us; for myself, I think a free walk on the greensward would do me much good at heart.&quot;
&quot;Evil-disposed indeed, madam,&quot; replied the court dame, &quot;and more especially since breakfast.&quot;
The Lady hastened to support the Queen&#39;s head, who, turning her eyes towards her with an air of great languor, exclaimed, &quot;Thanks, my dearest Lady of Lochleven--notwithstanding some passages of late, I have never misconstrued or misdoubted your affection to our house.
&quot;How deep must the love of sarcasm, be implanted in the breasts of us women, since the Queen, with all her sense, will risk ruin rather than rein in her wit!&quot;
The towers in which your captives pine away into unpitied graves, yet stand fast on their foundation--the crimes wrought in them have not yet burst their vaults asunder--your men have still their cross-bows, pistolets, and daggers--why need you seek to herbs or charms for the execution of your revenges?&quot;
Methinks I propose to you but a fair exchange when I say I forgive your vassal with all my heart, and leave vengeance to God, and to his conscience, so that you also forgive the boldness of this woman in your presence; for we trust you do not hold it as a crime, that she substituted an innocent beverage for the mortal poison which was to have drenched our cup.&quot;
Sadly and slowly the Chamberlain raised his depressed stature into the perpendicular attitude, and left the apartment dejectedly, followed by Magdalen Graeme, after, with mute but expressive gesture, she had kissed the reliquary with which the Queen had presented her, and, raising her clasped hands and uplifted eyes towards Heaven, had seemed to entreat a benediction upon the royal dame.
The worthy waggoner, according to the established customs of all carriers, stage-coachmen, and other persons in public authority, from the earliest days to the present, never wanted good reasons for stopping upon the road, as often as he would; and the place which had most captivation for him as a resting-place was a change-house, as it was termed, not very distant from a romantic dell, well known by the name of Keirie Craigs.
Attractions of a kind very different from those which arrested the progress of John Auchtermuchty and his wains, still continue to hover round this romantic spot, and none has visited its vicinity without a desire to remain long and to return soon.
for the love of Heaven!&quot;
Good my murderer, and the rest of you, stand back a little, and let me speak with this unhappy apostate.--Kneel down by me, Master George--You have heard that I failed in my attempt to take away that Moabitish stumbling-block and her retinue--I gave them that which I thought would have removed the temptation out of thy path--and this, though I had other reasons to show to thy mother and others, I did chiefly purpose for love of thee.&quot;
&quot;For the love of me, base poisoner!&quot;
Hast thou not, despite the honour thou owest to thy parents, the faith that is due to thy religion, the truth that is due to thy king, been so carried away by the charms of this beautiful sorceress, that thou wouldst have helped her to escape from her prison-house, and lent her thine arm again to ascend the throne, which she had made a place of abomination?--Nay, stir not from me--my hand, though fast stiffening, has yet force enough to hold thee--What dost thou aim at?--to wed this witch of Scotland?--I warrant thee, thou mayest succeed--her heart and hand have been oft won at a cheaper rate, than thou, fool that thou art, would think thyself happy to pay.
But, should a servant of thy father&#39;s house have seen thee embrace the fate of the idiot Darnley, or of the villain Bothwell--the fate of the murdered fool, or of the living pirate--while an ounce of ratsbane would have saved thee?&quot;
Henry, if thou meanest me, I am but half a Douglas in this emprize--half head, half heart, and half hand.--But I will think on one who can never be forgotten, and be all, or more, than any of my ancestors was ever.--Keltie, say it was Henry Seyton did the deed; but beware, not a word of me!--Let Auchtermuchty carry this packet&quot; (which he had resealed with his own signet) &quot;to my father at Edinburgh; and here is to pay for the funeral expenses, and thy loss of custom.&quot;
Lady Fleming was somewhat alarmed at this surmise, but comforted herself by observing that the chimney of the kitchen had reeked that whole day in a manner which contradicted the supposition.--Catherine Seyton presently exclaimed, &quot;They were bearing the dishes across the court, marshalled by the Lady Lochleven herself, dressed out in her highest and stiffest ruff, with her partlet and sleeves of cyprus, and her huge old-fashioned farthingale of crimson velvet.&quot;
&quot;I believe on my word,&quot; said the page, approaching the window also, &quot;it was in that very farthingale that she captivated the heart of gentle King Jamie, which procured our poor Queen her precious bargain of a brother.&quot;
&quot;Done, and done thoroughly,&quot; said Randal; &quot;a Seyton seldom strikes twice--But the body was not despoiled, and your honour&#39;s packet goes forward to Edinburgh by Auchtermuchty, who leaves Keltie-Bridge early to-morrow--marry, he has drunk two bottles of aquavitae to put the fright out of his head, and now sleeps them off beside his cart-avers.&quot;
God knows, I grudge not his life in your Grace&#39;s quarrel; and love him for the willingness with which he labours for your rescue.
With Henry for my knight, and Roland Graeme for my trusty squire, methinks I am like a princess of romance, who may shortly set at defiance the dungeons and the weapons of all wicked sorcerers.--But my head aches with the agitation of the day.
Take me _La Mer Des Histoires_, and resume where we left off on Wednesday.--Our Lady help thy head, girl, or rather may she help thy heart!--I asked thee for the Sea of Histories, and thou hast brought _La Cronique d&#39;Amour_.&quot;
He now remembered a thousand circumstances of voice and manner, which, had his own prepossession been less, must surely have discriminated the brother from the sister; and he felt ashamed, that, having as it were by heart every particular of Catherine&#39;s gestures, words, and manners, he should have thought her, notwithstanding her spirits and levity, capable of assuming the bold step, loud tones, and forward assurance, which accorded well enough with her brother&#39;s hasty and masculine character.
Roland must have been duller, and more sheepish than ever was youthful lover, if he had not endeavoured to avail himself of this opportunity.
I have heard the Queen say, in her sad hours, that men are, in love or in hate, the most selfish animals of creation; and your carelessness in this matter looks very like it.
If your brother stood before me, with his drawn weapon in his hand, so like as he is to you in word, person, and favour, he might shed my life&#39;s blood ere I could find in my heart to resist him to his injury.&quot;
said Catherine, &quot;there spoke the doughty knight of romance, that will cut his way to the imprisoned princess, through fiends and fiery dragons!&quot;
And having thus disposed of her attendant in the manner best qualified to hide her confusion, the Queen added, speaking apart to Roland, &quot;I should at least have two grateful subjects of Catherine and you; for what sovereign but Mary would aid true love so willingly?--Ay, you lay your hand on your sword--your _petite flamberge � rien_ there--Well, short time will show if all the good be true that is protested to us--I hear them toll curfew from Kinross.
The Queen and her ladies exchanged with each other a look of disappointment, anger, and vexation; and Mary said aloud, &quot;We cannot regret the smallness of our court, when we see our hostess discharge in person so many of its offices.
But how is this to be done, and which of my little court dare attempt this _tour de jongleur_ with any chance of success?
By that signal, I know that more than one true heart is plotting my deliverance; and without that consciousness, and the hope of freedom it gives me, I had long since stooped to my fate, and died of a broken heart.
&quot;Now count,&quot; said Queen Mary, &quot;for my heart beats so thick that I cannot count myself.&quot;
said the Lady Douglas, apostrophizing the poet, &quot;a kinder heart never inspired a rhyme, and the Douglas&#39;s honour was ever on thy heart-string!
Roland thought in his heart, that when the truth was spoken for the purpose of deceiving, it was little better than a lie in disguise.
In the evening two beams twinkled from the cottage, instead of one; and the page heard, with beating heart, that the new retainer was ordered to stand sentinel on the outside of the castle.
Thus resolved, he stood like a greyhound in the slips, with hand, heart, and eye intent upon making and seizing opportunity for the execution of their project.
If we believe the English ambassador Drury, the Queen was grateful to George Douglas, and even proposed a marriage with him; a scheme which could hardly be serious, since she was still the wife of Bothwell, but which, if suggested at all, might be with a purpose of gratifying the Regent Murray&#39;s ambition, and propitiating his favour; since he was, it must be remembered, the brother uterine of George Douglas, for whom such high honour was said to be designed.
It seemeth she knew her refuge, and--where to have found it if she had once landed; for there did, and yet do linger, at a little village called Kinross, hard at the Loch side, the same George Douglas, one Sempel and one Beton, the which two were sometime her trusty servants, and, as yet appeareth, they mind her no less affection.&quot;
In narrating this romantic story, both history and tradition confuse the two Douglasses together, and confer on George the successful execution of the escape from the castle, the merit of which belongs, in reality, to the boy called William, or, more frequently, the Little Douglas, either from his youth or his slight stature.
The reader will observe, that in the romance, the part of the Little Douglas has been assigned to Roland Graeme.
As for gold, if I had loved it, I might have remained Lord Abbot of St. Mary&#39;s--and yet, I wot not--for, if Abbot Boniface be but the poor peasant Blinkhoolie, his successor, the Abbot Ambrosius, is still transmuted for the worse into the guise of a sword-and-buckler-man.&quot;
&quot;And if the horse which bears so dear a burden could speak,&quot; answered the deep voice of the melancholy George of Douglas, &quot;would she not reply, who but Rosabelle ought at such an emergence as this to serve her beloved mistress, or who but Douglas ought to hold her bridle-rein?&quot;

to whom political interest is every thing, and whose heart never betrays thy head.--And now must I seek this other boy, if I would prevent daggers-drawing betwixt him and the young Seyton.&quot;
My hand has passed current for hers with him before now--and to win my friendship, he must give up thoughts of my sister&#39;s love.&quot;
The Queen was again about to interfere, for Roland&#39;s complexion rose, and it became somewhat questionable how long his love for Catherine would suppress the natural fire of his temper.
how many ways does woman&#39;s affection find to work out her own misery!
&quot;Ay, madam,&quot; replied young Seyton, &quot;as when he carried the billet enclosed in the sword-sheath to Lochleven--marry, the good youth knew no more than a pack-horse what he was carrying.&quot;
Since then I have seen him only in a few hours of doubt and dread, and now I part with the child of my love--for ever--for ever!--Oh, for every weary step I have made in your rightful cause, in this and in foreign lands, give protection to the child whom I must no more call mine!&quot;
She glided from their presence as she spoke, and her last look was upon her beloved grandchild.
Roland made no answer, but bit his lip till the blood came, and spurring his horse up to the side of Catherine Seyton&#39;s palfrey, he whispered in a low voice, &quot;I never thought to have done aught to deserve you; but this day I have heard myself upbraided with cowardice, and my sword remained still sheathed, and all for the love of you.&quot;
said Catherine--&quot;Can a woman say to a man what I have well-nigh said to thee, and yet think that he could harbour fear or faintness of heart?--There is that in yon distant sound of approaching battle that pleases me even while it affrights me.
&quot;Oh, I must forget much, much more,&quot; answered the unfortunate Mary, in an under tone, &quot;ere I can look with steady eyes on these well-known scenes!--I must forget the days which I spent here as the bride of the lost--the murdered----&quot; &quot;This is the Castle of Crookstone,&quot; said the Lady Fleming, &quot;in which the Queen held her first court after she was married to Darnley.&quot;
&quot;Ay, fair and stately tree,&quot; she said, as if at the sight of it she had been rapt away from the present scene, and had overcome the horror which had oppressed her at the first approach to Crookstone, &quot;there thou standest, gay and goodly as ever, though thou hearest the sounds of war, instead of the vows of love.
All is gone since I last greeted thee--love and lover--vows and vower--king and kingdom.--How goes the field, my Lord Abbot?--with us, I trust--yet what but evil can Mary&#39;s eyes witness from this spot?&quot;
As he approached, the shots rung sharp and more sharply on his ear, the shouts came wilder and wilder, and he felt that thick beating of the heart, that mixture of natural apprehension, intense curiosity, and anxiety for the dubious event, which even the bravest experience when they approach alone to a scene of interest and of danger.
&quot;I will never mount steed more,&quot; said the youth; &quot;farewell--I love thee better dying, than ever I thought to have done while in life--I would that old man&#39;s blood were not on my hand!--_Sancte Benedicte, ora pro me_--Stand not to look on a dying man, but haste to save the Queen!&quot;
&quot;Look on these features,&quot; said Mary, pointing to the dying knight, who had been unhelmed by some compassionate hand; &quot;look there, and tell me if she who ruins all who love her, ought to fly a foot farther to save her wretched life!&quot;
&quot;Look--look at him well,&quot; said the Queen, &quot;thus has it been with all who loved Mary Stewart!--The royalty of Francis, the wit of Chastelar, the power and gallantry of the gay Gordon, the melody of Rizzio, the portly form and youthful grace of Darnley, the bold address and courtly manners of Bothwell--and now the deep-devoted passion of the noble Douglas--nought could save them!--they looked on the wretched Mary, and to have loved her was crime enough to deserve early death!
No sooner had the victim formed a kind thought of me, than the poisoned cup, the axe and block, the dagger, the mine, were ready to punish them for casting away affection on such a wretch as I am!--Importune me not--I will fly no farther--I can die but once, and I will die here.&quot;
He expired with these words, and without withdrawing his eyes from her face; and the Queen, whose heart was of that soft and gentle mould, which in domestic life, and with a more suitable partner than Darnley, might have made her happy, remained weeping by the dead man, until recalled to herself by the Abbot, who found it necessary to use a style of unusual remonstrance.
He struck a bold note, but the heart of Mary made no response.
I would not again undergo what I felt, when I saw from yonder mount the swords of the fell horsemen of Morton raging among the faithful Seytons and Hamiltons, for their loyalty to their Queen--I would not again feel what I felt when Douglas&#39;s life-blood stained my mantle for his love to Mary Stewart--not to be empress of all that Britain&#39;s seas enclose.
Find for me some place where I can hide my unhappy head, which brings destruction on all who love it--it is the last favour that Mary asks of her faithful followers.&quot;
&quot;Good Roland,&quot; said the Queen, whispering, &quot;let Rosabelle be cared for--ask thy heart, and it will tell thee why I make this trifling request even in this awful hour.&quot;
&quot;Nay, you said as much before,&quot; said the querulous old man, &quot;and yet I was put forth from Kinross, and pillaged by troopers on the road.--They took from me the certificate that you wot of--that of the Baron--ay, he was a moss-trooper like themselves--You asked me of it, and I could never find it, but they found it--it showed the marriage of--of--my memory fails me--Now see how men differ!
&quot;Welcome, my Lord Abbot,&quot; she said, speaking to Ambrosius, &quot;and you, Roland Avenel, we have joyful news for you--our loving sister&#39;s officer proffers us, in her name, a safe asylum from the rebels who have driven us from our home--only it grieves me we must here part from you for a short space.&quot;
Elizabeth loves fame--and not all that she has won by her power and her wisdom will equal that which she will acquire by extending her hospitality to a distressed sister!--not all that she may hereafter do of good, wise, and great, would blot out the reproach of abusing our confidence.--Farewell, my page--now my knight--farewell for a brief season.
--She held out her hand to Roland, who flinging himself on his knees, kissed it with much emotion.
The paper which he gave, was, indeed, an attestation by Father Philip, subscribing himself unworthy Sacristan, and brother of the House of Saint Mary&#39;s, stating, &quot;that under a vow of secrecy he had united, in the holy sacrament of marriage, Julian Avenel and Catherine Graeme; but that Julian having repented of his union, he, Father Philip, had been sinfully prevailed on by him to conceal and disguise the same, according to a complot devised betwixt him and the said Julian Avenel, whereby the poor damsel was induced to believe that the ceremony had been performed by one not in holy orders, and having no authority to that effect.
Wherefore he had deposited this testificate and confession with the day and date of the said marriage, with his lawful superior Boniface, Abbot of Saint Mary&#39;s, _sub sigillo confessionis_.&quot;
It appeared by a letter from Julian, folded carefully up with the certificate, that the Abbot Boniface had, in effect, bestirred himself in the affair, and obtained from the Baron a promise to avow his marriage; but the death of both Julian and his injured bride, together with the Abbot&#39;s resignation, his ignorance of the fate of their unhappy offspring, and above all, the good father&#39;s listless and inactive disposition, had suffered the matter to become totally forgotten, until it was recalled by some accidental conversation with the Abbot Ambrosius concerning the fortunes of the Avenel family.
To the true gospel the heart of Roland had secretly long inclined, and the departure of the good Abbot for France, with the purpose of entering into some house of his order in that kingdom, removed his chief objection to renouncing the Catholic faith.
But he guessed their purpose, and prayed them, on his death-bed, to do no honours to the body of one as sinful as themselves; but to send his body and his heart to be buried in Avenel burial-aisle, in the monastery of Saint Mary&#39;s, that the last Abbot of that celebrated house of devotion might sleep among its ruins.
[Footnote: This was not the explanation of the incident of searching for the heart, mentioned in the introduction to the tale, which the author originally intended.
It was designed to refer to the heart of Robert Bruce.
It is generally known that that great monarch, being on his death-bed, bequeathed to the good Lord James of Douglas, the task of carrying his heart to the Holy Land, to fulfil in a certain degree his own desire to perform a crusade.
Upon Douglas&#39;s death, fighting against the Moors in Spain, a sort of military hors d&#39;oeuvre to which he could have pleaded no regular call of duty, his followers brought back the Bruce&#39;s heart, and deposited it in the Abbey church of Melrose, the Kennaquhair of the tale.
It enlarges so much on the love of the royal writer to the community of Melrose, that it is well worthy of being inserted in a work connected in some degree with Scottish History.
The letter announces that the King had already destined his heart to be deposited at Melrose.
The resolution to send it to Palestine, under the charge of Douglas, must have been adopted betwixt 11th May 1329, the date of the letter, and 7th June of the same year, when the Bruce died; or else we must suppose that the commission of Douglas extended not only to taking the Bruce&#39;s heart to Palestine, but to bring it safe back to its final place of deposit in the Abbey of Melrose.
It would not be worth inquiring: by what caprice the author was induced to throw the incident of the Bruce&#39;s heart entirely out of the story, save merely to say, that he found himself unable to fill up the canvass he had sketched, and indisposed to prosecute the management of the supernatural machinery with which his plan, when it was first rough-hewn, was connected and combined.]

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>He was urged by the reflection that an affectionate farewell might help to exonerate him from the charge of neglect frequently preferred by this lady.
It was not that the young man disliked her; on the contrary, he regarded her with a tender admiration, and he had not forgotten how, when his cousin had brought her home on her marriage, he had seemed to feel the upward sweep of the empty bough from which the golden fruit had been plucked, and had then and there accepted the prospect of bachelorhood.
He no longer felt like marrying her: in these eight years that fancy had died a natural death.
“It ‘s only a word to the wise, a notification that you are expected not to run your course without having done something handsome for your fellow-men.” Nine o’clock sounded, and Bessie, with each stroke, courted a closer embrace.
She turned and kissed her cousin, and deposited an irrepressible tear on his moustache.
The genius has been left out, the faculty of expression is wanting; but the need for expression remains, and I spend my days groping for the latch of a closed door.” “What an immense number of words,” said Cecilia after a pause, “to say you want to fall in love!
Why he had gone forth so suddenly across the seas to marry her, what had happened between them before, and whether--though it was of questionable propriety for a good citizen to espouse a young person of mysterious origin, who did her hair in fantastically elaborate plaits, and in whose appearance “figure” enjoyed such striking predominance--he would not have had a heavy weight on his conscience if he had remained an irresponsible bachelor; these questions and many others, bearing with varying degrees of immediacy on the subject, were much propounded but scantily answered, and this history need not be charged with resolving them.
Jonas Mallet, at the time of his marriage, was conducting with silent shrewdness a small, unpromising business.
Her marriage had been an immitigable error which she had spent her life in trying to look straight in the face.
He wore a vivid blue cravat, passed through a ring altogether too splendid to be valuable; he pulled and twisted, as he sat, a pair of yellow kid gloves; he emphasized his conversation with great dashes and flourishes of a light, silver-tipped walking-stick, and he kept constantly taking off and putting on one of those slouched sombreros which are the traditional property of the Virginian or Carolinian of romance.
She had some property herself, and married a Virginian gentleman of good estates.
He had an indefinable attraction--the something divine of unspotted, exuberant, confident youth.
Something seemed to tell him that later, in a foreign land, he would remember it lovingly and penitently.
“I declare,” he cried, “there ‘s a career for a man, and I ‘ve twenty minds to decide, on the spot, to embrace it--to be the consummate, typical, original, national American artist!
You have been very happy, I suspect, in spite of your virtues, and there are worse fates in the world than being loved too well.
She is passionately fond of you, and her hopes, like all intense hopes, keep trembling into fears.” Rowland, as he spoke, had an instinctive vision of how such a beautiful young fellow must be loved by his female relatives.
I had the silver mug and the biggest piece of pudding, and I stayed in-doors to be kissed by the ladies while he made mud-pies in the garden and was never missed, of course.
When he was brought home from Vicksburg with a piece of shell in his skull, my poor mother began to think she had n’t loved him enough.
I kissed her solemnly at last, and told her that I had said everything and that she must make the best of it.
It was a flirtation without the benefits of a flirtation.
She was too old to let him fall in love with her, which might have done him good; and her inclination was to keep him young, so that the nonsense he talked might never transgress a certain line.
I hope with all my heart that the fruit will be proportionate to the foliage.
“We ‘ll drink then to-day at dinner to the health of our friend.” * * * Having it much at heart to convince Mrs. Hudson of the purity of his intentions, Rowland waited upon her that evening.
“I have become suddenly so very intimate with your son,” he said at last, addressing himself to Mrs. Hudson, “that it seems just I should make your acquaintance.” “Very just,” murmured the poor lady, and after a moment’s hesitation was on the point of adding something more; but Mr. Striker here interposed, after a prefatory clearance of the throat.
Hardly three days.” “And yet you call yourself intimate, eh?
“But a sculptor’s studies, you intimate, are not confined to the antique,” Mr. Striker resumed.
But to a sculptor who loves his work there is no time lost.
“He ‘s very lovable, sir, I assure you.
When you come to know him you ‘ll find him very lovable.
I never supposed--I never imagined”-- “That I was in love with her?” Roderick interrupted.
But you came and put me into such ridiculous good-humor that I felt an extraordinary desire to tell some woman that I adored her.
I have been quietly learning to know her, these past three months, and have been falling in love with her without being conscious of it.
I must of course make some money before we can marry.
If ever I am a dull companion and over-addicted to moping, remember in justice to me that I am in love and that my sweetheart is five thousand miles away.” Rowland listened to all this with a sort of feeling that fortune had played him an elaborately-devised trick.
It was for that I fell in love with her, and with rigid virtue in her person.” “She is a moralist, but not, as you imply, a narrow one.
Changed as I am, I adore her none the less.
His appetite for novelty was insatiable, and for everything characteristically foreign, as it presented itself, he had an extravagant greeting; but in half an hour the novelty had faded, he had guessed the secret, he had plucked out the heart of the mystery and was clamoring for a keener sensation.
The black archway which admitted you might have served as the portal of the Augean stables, but you emerged presently upon a mouldy little court, of which the fourth side was formed by a narrow terrace, overhanging the Tiber.
He had the tastes of a collector; he spent half his afternoons ransacking the dusty magazines of the curiosity-mongers, and often made his way, in quest of a prize, into the heart of impecunious Roman households, which had been prevailed upon to listen--with closed doors and an impenetrably wary smile--to proposals for an hereditary “antique.” In the evening, often, under the lamp, amid dropped curtains and the scattered gleam of firelight upon polished carvings and mellow paintings, the two friends sat with their heads together, criticising intaglios and etchings, water-color drawings and illuminated missals.
Afterwards, when those who loved him were in tears, there was something in all this unspotted comeliness that seemed to lend a mockery to the causes of their sorrow.
It was the artist’s opinion that there is no essential difference between beauty and ugliness; that they overlap and intermingle in a quite inextricable manner; that there is no saying where one begins and the other ends; that hideousness grimaces at you suddenly from out of the very bosom of loveliness, and beauty blooms before your eyes in the lap of vileness; that it is a waste of wit to nurse metaphysical distinctions, and a sadly meagre entertainment to caress imaginary lines; that the thing to aim at is the expressive, and the way to reach it is by ingenuity; that for this purpose everything may serve, and that a consummate work is a sort of hotch-potch of the pure and the impure, the graceful and the grotesque.
In this way they had become almost intimate.
There was another woman whom he liked better, an image in his heart which refused to yield precedence.
But since he was obliged to give up hopes of Mary Garland, Providence owed him a compensation, and he had fits of angry sadness in which it seemed to him that to attest his right to sentimental satisfaction he would be capable of falling in love with a woman he absolutely detested, if she were the best that came in his way.
Her good sense had been wanting on but a single occasion, that of her second marriage.
The marriage was most unhappy, and the Maestro Grandoni was suspected of using the fiddle-bow as an instrument of conjugal correction.
Rowland had a great regard for her, and she repaid it by wishing him to get married.
You will have to take to violence, to contortions, to romanticism, in self-defense.
I hope with all my heart that Mr. Hudson will do the fine things he talks about, but he must bear in mind the history of dear Mr. Schafgans as a warning against high-flown pretensions.
One fine day this poor young man fell in love with a Roman model, though she had never sat to him, I believe, for she was a buxom, bold-faced, high-colored creature, and he painted none but pale, sickly women.
He offered to marry her, and she looked at him from head to foot, gave a shrug, and consented.
He was getting his living by painting views of Vesuvius in eruption on the little boxes they sell at Sorrento.” “Moral: don’t fall in love with a buxom Roman model,” said Roderick.
“I ‘m much obliged to you for your story, but I don’t mean to fall in love with any one.” Gloriani had possessed himself of the photograph again, and was looking at it curiously.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“The difficult place is here!” And he struck a blow on his heart.
And he felt a flood of comradeship rise in his heart which would float them both safely through the worst weather.
At a little mountain village by the way, Roderick declared that he would stop; he would scramble about a little in the high places and doze in the shade of the pine forests.
Verily, it ‘s a good thing for a woman to be in love: Miss Garland has grown almost pretty.
The monotonous days of the two women seemed to Rowland’s fancy to follow each other like the tick-tick of a great time-piece, marking off the hours which separated them from the supreme felicity of clasping the far-away son and lover to lips sealed with the excess of joy.
If you have got facility, revere it, respect it, adore it, treasure it--don’t speculate on it.” And he wondered what his companion, up to his knees in debt, would have done if there had been no good-natured Rowland Mallet to lend a helping hand.
People talk as if the two things were essentially distinct; on different sides of one’s organism, like the heart and the liver.
He had not been out of Italy, but he had been delving deep into the picturesque heart of the lovely land, and gathering a wonderful store of subjects.
Has he been disappointed in love?
Stenterello, love, give a pretty smile and say tanti complimenti!” The poodle wagged his white pate--it looked like one of those little pads in swan’s-down, for applying powder to the face--and repeated the barking process.
What are poor we to do?” Rowland had begun to murmur some remedial proposition, when he was interrupted by the voice of Miss Light calling across the room, “Mamma!” “My own love?” “This gentleman wishes to model my bust.
He had married a horrible wife, an Englishwoman who had been on the stage.
He came up to Rome on a holiday, fell in love with Miss Savage, and married her on the spot.
He had not been married three years when he was drowned in the Adriatic, no one ever knew how.
It might have been supposed that Mrs. Light would marry again, and I know she had opportunities.
Once came a rumor that she was going to make a grand marriage in England; then we heard that the gentleman had thought better of it and left her to keep afloat as she could.
She has been told twenty times a day by her mother, since she was five years old, that she is a beauty of beauties, that her face is her fortune, and that, if she plays her cards, she may marry a duke.
If her daughter were less of a beauty, her transparent ambition would be very ridiculous; but there is something in the girl, as one looks at her, that seems to make it very possible she is marked out for one of those wonderful romantic fortunes that history now and then relates.
Christina, love, look at that mosaic table.
He could not have defined and explained the nature of his great love, nor have made up the sum of it by the addition of his calculable pleasures.
An uninitiated observer, hearing him, would have imagined her to be a person of a certain age--possibly an affectionate maiden aunt--who had once done him a kindness which he highly appreciated: perhaps presented him with a check for a thousand dollars.
There was something terribly hard to explain in the fact of his having fallen in love with his cousin.
Just why it was that Roderick should not logically have fancied Miss Garland, his companion would have been at loss to say, but I think the conviction had its roots in an unformulated comparison between himself and the accepted suitor.
Roderick and he were as different as two men could be, and yet Roderick had taken it into his head to fall in love with a woman for whom he himself had been keeping in reserve, for years, a profoundly characteristic passion.
There were women, he said to himself, whom it was every one’s business to fall in love with a little--women beautiful, brilliant, artful, easily fascinating.
Miss Light, for instance, was one of these; every man who spoke to her did so, if not in the language, at least with something of the agitation, the divine tremor, of a lover.
There was an element in the charm, as his companion saw it, which Rowland was obliged to recognize, but which he forbore to ponder; the rather important attraction, namely, of reciprocity.
As to Miss Garland being in love with Roderick and becoming charming thereby, this was a point with which his imagination ventured to take no liberties; partly because it would have been indelicate, and partly because it would have been vain.
“Christina, love, I am surprised.” “Is it indelicate?” Christina asked.
Last summer, at Carlsbad, there was an Austrian count, with enormous estates and some great office at court.
“Let me model you, and he who can may marry you!” he said, abruptly.
“It would be prettier if you said here!” And Christina touched her heart.
On seeing Rowland he put her down with a kiss, and stepped forward with a conscious grin, an unresentful admission that he was sensitive both to chubbiness and ridicule.
He wondered gloomily, at any rate, whether for men of his companion’s large, easy power, there was not a larger moral law than for narrow mediocrities like himself, who, yielding Nature a meagre interest on her investment (such as it was), had no reason to expect from her this affectionate laxity as to their accounts.
She sobbed as if her heart would break.
Of course I could help her only by letting her talk herself out and kissing her and patting her beautiful hands and telling her to be patient and she would be happy yet.
I believe I melted down to the point of telling her that I would find some good, quiet, affectionate husband for her; but she declared, almost with fury, that she was sick unto death of husbands, and begged I would never again mention the word.
And, in fact, it was a rash offer; for I am sure that there is not a man of the kind that might really make a woman happy but would be afraid to marry mademoiselle.
“Be very reasonable, then, and go away.” “Why the deuce should I go away?” “Because you are in love,” said the Cavaliere.
“I might as well be in love here as in the streets.” “Carry your love as far as possible from Christina.
It would take too long to explain; I only beg you to believe that if you continue to love Miss Light you will be very unhappy.
“Now that I have obtained it, let me tell you that I am no more in love with Miss Light than you are.
But that ‘s no one’s business but my own, and though I have, as you say, neither a princely title nor a princely fortune, I mean to suffer neither those advantages nor those who possess them to diminish my right.” “If you are not in love, my dear young man,” said the Cavaliere, with his hand on his heart and an apologetic smile, “so much the better.
But let me entreat you, as an affectionate friend, to keep a watch on your emotions.
You are young, you are handsome, you have a brilliant genius and a generous heart, but--I may say it almost with authority--Christina is not for you!” Whether Roderick was in love or not, he was nettled by what apparently seemed to him an obtrusive negation of an inspiring possibility.
She will marry the man who pleases her, if he has n’t a dollar!
There are so many people here whom I dislike more, that when I espied you just now, you seemed like an intimate friend.
Now I have an idea that you would make a useful friend--an intimate friend--a friend to whom one could tell everything.
And very clever.” “Did he make love to her?” “Not in the least.” “Well, who else?” “He lived with his mother.
Rowland felt a kind of dumb anger rising in his heart.
Why don’t they marry?” “Roderick is waiting till he can afford to marry.” Christina slowly put out her arm again and looked at the dimple in her elbow.
“My precious love,” she cried, “what a place to hide in!
It seemed to me that Miss Light had better know that your affections are pledged.” “The Cavaliere has put it into your head, then, that I am making love to her?” “No; in that case I would not have spoken to her first.” “Do you mean, then, that she is making love to me?” “This is what I mean,” said Rowland, after a pause.
Dedicate your nerves to some better cause, and believe that if Miss Garland and I have a quarrel, we shall settle it between ourselves.” Rowland had found himself wondering, shortly before, whether possibly his brilliant young friend was without a conscience; now it dimly occurred to him that he was without a heart.
“Here is an uncommonly fine thing,” he said to himself: “a nature unconsciously grateful, a man in whom friendship does the thing that love alone generally has the credit of--knocks the bottom out of pride!” His reflective judgment of Roderick, as time went on, had indulged in a great many irrepressible vagaries; but his affection, his sense of something in his companion’s whole personality that overmastered his heart and beguiled his imagination, had never for an instant faltered.
Do you really mean that you have an inexorable need of embarking on a flirtation with Miss Light?--a flirtation as to the felicity of which there may be differences of opinion, but which cannot at best, under the circumstances, be called innocent.
The villas at Frascati are delicious places, and replete with romantic suggestiveness.
I shall take a nap and see if I can dream of a bright idea or two.” He turned his face upward to the parasol of the great pine, closed his eyes, and in a short time forgot his sombre fancies.
You see, far away, the blue, blue sea and the little smoke of Vesuvio!” “Christina, love,” cried Mrs. Light forthwith, “the prince has a terrace four hundred feet long, all paved with marble!” The Cavaliere gave a little cough and began to wipe his eye-glass.
“Fancy the poor little devils looking up from their Latin declensions and seeing Miss Light standing there!” “I should like to see the poor little devils, with their rosy cheeks and their long black gowns, and when they were pretty, I should n’t scruple to kiss them.
He comes of a very great family--a race of princes who for six hundred years have married none but the daughters of princes.
But he is seriously in love, and he would marry her to-morrow.” “And she will not have him?” “Ah, she is very proud, too!” The Cavaliere was silent a moment, as if he were measuring the propriety of frankness.
She would rather have her beauty blasted than seem to care about the marriage, and if she ever accepts the prince it will be only after he has implored her on his knees!” “But she does care about it,” said Rowland, “and to bring him to his knees she is working upon his jealousy by pretending to be interested in my friend Hudson.
Miss Light is a singular girl; she has many romantic ideas.
She would be quite capable of interesting herself seriously in an interesting young man, like your friend, and doing her utmost to discourage a splendid suitor, like the prince.
I can’t tell you more.” “But this implies that the rejected suitor would also come back.
He is far gone.” “Who is this exemplary lover, then; what is he?” “A Neapolitan; one of the oldest houses in Italy.
He fell in love with her from the first, but his family interfered, and an old uncle, an ecclesiastic, Monsignor B----, hurried up to Naples, seized him, and locked him up.
His relations are moving heaven and earth to prevent his marrying Miss Light, and they have sent us word that he forfeits his property if he takes his wife out of a certain line.
He ‘s very grave and very devout--though he does propose to marry a Protestant.
He will handle that point after marriage.
“Eh, dear signore, the Christina is very romantic!” “So much so, you intimate, that she will eventually retract, in consequence not of a change of sentiment, but of a mysterious outward pressure?” “If everything else fails, there is that resource.
You maintain that there is nothing but disappointment in store for the infatuated youth who loses his heart to her!” The Cavaliere hesitated.
Look at that unhappy young man.” “Yes,” said Rowland, “he seems unhappy.” “He is just come of age, he bears one of the greatest names in Italy and owns one of the greatest properties, and he is pining away with love for my daughter.” “So the Cavaliere tells me.” “The Cavaliere should n’t gossip,” said Mrs. Light dryly.
He would marry her to-morrow, at six o’clock in the morning!” “It is certainly very sad,” said Rowland.
Rowland observed that Mrs. Light had a genuine maternal conscience; she considered that she had been performing a sacred duty in bringing up Christina to set her cap for a prince, and when the future looked dark, she found consolation in thinking that destiny could never have the heart to deal a blow at so deserving a person.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>All of a sudden I gave a cry, pounced on it, pressed it in my arms, and covered it with kisses.
I said, ‘No, I thank you, sir; she is meant to be something finer than a princesse de theatre.’ I had a passionate belief that she might marry absolutely whom she chose, that she might be a princess out and out.
I have gone so far as to think at times that those childish kisses were a sign--a symbol--a portent.
In other words, she had an appointment with her lover, who had better, from present appearances, be punctual.
In such a man as that, I say, one’s weary imagination at last may rest; or it may wander if it will, yet never need to wander far from the deeps where one’s heart is anchored.
It was all against the grain; he wrought without love.
The church of Saint Cecilia has one of these sunny, waste-looking courts; the edifice seems abandoned to silence and the charity of chance devotion.
He was not in love with her; he disapproved of her; he mistrusted her; and yet he felt it a kind of privilege to watch her, and he found a peculiar excitement in talking to her.
Hudson is in love with me!” she said.
I am pretty sure you cannot imagine yourself marrying my friend.” “There ‘s nothing I cannot imagine!
If you cared for him enough to marry him, I should have nothing to say; I would never venture to interfere.
At last, without moving, “If I were to marry him,” she asked, “what would have become of his fiancee?” “I am bound to suppose that she would be extremely unhappy.” Christina said nothing more, and Rowland, to let her make her reflections, left his place and strolled away.
“What do you think,” she asked, looking at him, “of your friend’s infidelity?” “I don’t like it.” “Was he very much in love with her?” “He asked her to marry him.
You may judge.” “Is she rich?” “No, she is poor.” “Is she very much in love with him?” “I know her too little to say.” She paused again, and then resumed: “You have settled in your mind, then, that I will never seriously listen to him?” “I think it unlikely, until the contrary is proved.” “How shall it be proved?
But tell me,” she continued, “shall you consider--admitting your proposition--that in ceasing to flirt with Mr. Hudson, so that he may go about his business, I do something magnanimous, heroic, sublime--something with a fine name like that?” Rowland, elated with the prospect of gaining his point, was about to reply that she would deserve the finest name in the world; but he instantly suspected that this tone would not please her, and, besides, it would not express his meaning.
At last they passed out into the court.
Christina talked of the church, of the picturesque old court, of that strange, decaying corner of Rome.
I love the poor fellow and I can’t give him up.
He ‘s inflexible, he ‘s brittle; and though he has plenty of spirit, plenty of soul, he has n’t what I call a heart.
And you may take this for truth, because I ‘m not in love with her.
She has had offers of marriage from various great lords.
Yes, I regret that Miss Light should marry one of these used-up foreigners.
“Pray, sir, is it my infelicitous allusion to Miss Light’s marriage?” “It ‘s your infelicitous everything!
The keenness of his irritation subsided, but it left him with an intolerable weight upon his heart.
You request me to take these suggestions to heart and to act upon them as promptly as possible.
“I must give you a very solemn kiss, my dear; you are the heroine of the hour.
He was sore at heart, and as the days went by the soreness deepened rather than healed.
The garden hangs in the air, and you ramble from terrace to terrace and wonder how it keeps from slipping down, in full consummation of its bereaved forlornness, into the nakedly romantic gorge beneath.
He never indulged in professions (touching personal conduct) as to the future, or in remorse as to the past, and as he would have asked no praise if he had traveled night and day to embrace his mother as she set foot on shore, he made (in Rowland’s presence, at least) no apology for having left her to come in search of him.
But Mrs. Hudson’s maternal heart had taken the alarm.
Roderick came in at this moment and kissed his mother, and then went over and joined Miss Garland.
But at last he turned away and came over to the fireside with a contraction of the eyebrows which seemed to intimate that Miss Garland’s influence was for the moment, at least, not soothing.
“Horrible?” “I feel so strangely--I could almost cry.” “How is it that you feel?” “So sorry for the poor past, that seems to have died here, in my heart, in an hour!” “But, surely, you ‘re pleased--you ‘re interested.” “I am overwhelmed.
“Mary, dear,” she whispered, “suppose we had to kiss that dreadful brass toe.
She kissed the brazen toe, touched it with her forehead, and turned round, facing our friends.
Rowland could not find it in his heart to accuse Roderick of neglect of the young girl; for it was natural that the inspirations of a capricious man of genius, when they came, should be imperious; but of course he wondered how Miss Garland felt, as the young man’s promised wife, on being thus expeditiously handed over to another man to be entertained.
They went a great deal to Saint Peter’s, for which Rowland had an exceeding affection, a large measure of which he succeeded in infusing into his companion.
Here and there was an open window, where they lingered and leaned, looking out into the warm, dead air, over the towers of the city, at the soft-hued, historic hills, at the stately shabby gardens of the palace, or at some sunny, empty, grass-grown court, lost in the heart of the labyrinthine pile.
Once, when they were standing before that noblest of sculptured portraits, the so-called Demosthenes, in the Braccio Nuovo, she made the only spontaneous allusion to her projected marriage, direct or indirect, that had yet fallen from her lips.
I live only from year to year.” “Shall you never marry?” Rowland gave a laugh.
I have not taken a vow of celibacy.” “Would n’t you like to marry?” “I should like it immensely.” To this she made no rejoinder: but presently she asked, “Why don’t you write a book?” Rowland laughed, this time more freely.
“She adores me!
You can’t break a ray of moonshine.” “Have you absolutely no affection for her?” Roderick placed his hand on his heart and held it there a moment.
“Make love to a girl I hate?” “You hate?” “As her lover, I should hate her!” “Listen to me!” said Rowland with vehemence.
Do you really urge my marrying a woman who would bore me to death?
On the twenty-fourth of June Miss Light is to be married.
I take an immense interest in all that concerns her, and I wish to be present at her wedding.” “But you said the other day at Saint Peter’s that it was by no means certain her marriage would take place.” “Apparently I was wrong: the invitations, I am told, are going out.” Rowland felt that it would be utterly vain to remonstrate, and that the only thing for him was to make the best terms possible.
“If I offer no further opposition to your waiting for Miss Light’s marriage,” he said, “will you promise, meanwhile and afterwards, for a certain period, to defer to my judgment--to say nothing that may be a cause of suffering to Miss Garland?” “For a certain period?
“Why, she adores him,” said Rowland, smiling.
Only if I, in his place, being suspected of having--what shall I call it?--a cold heart, managed to do that piece of work, oh, oh!
Rowland continued to see Madame Grandoni, for whom he felt a confirmed affection.
But one thing is very clear: you are in love with her.” Rowland, for all answer, glanced round to see that no one heard her.
“More than that,” she added, “you have been in love with her these two years.
The poor girl did her best, and I am sure that when she accepted Mr. Leavenworth she thought of you.” “She thought of the pleasure her marriage would give me.” “Ay, pleasure indeed!
“Well, then,” said Madame Grandoni, “if I like her, we ‘ll have it that you ought to be in love with her.
Leave me alone and I ‘ll tell her what I think of you.” As to Christina Light’s marriage, Madame Grandoni could make no definite statement.
“It is what they call a marriage of reason,” she once said.
“That means, you know, a marriage of madness!” “What have you said in the way of advice?” Rowland asked.
I know nothing of the mysteries of the young lady’s heart.
But the marriage in itself is an excellent marriage.
I think it very possible that after having kept them a month and produced a dozen cases of malaria, Christina will be married at midnight by an old friar, with simply the legal witnesses.” “It is true, then, that she has become a Catholic?” “So she tells me.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Such a stroke was her turning Catholic; such a stroke would be her some day making her courtesy to a disappointed world as Princess Casamassima, married at midnight, in her bonnet.
Rowland had found it disagreeable to be told Miss Blanchard would have married him for the asking, and he would have felt some embarrassment in going to speak to her if his modesty had not found incredulity so easy.
But in a moment Madame Grandoni had come to the young girl’s relief, and Christina had tenderly kissed her.
She gave a loving twist to his rose-colored top-knot, and bade him go and fetch her burnous.
She went to Madame Grandoni, grasped her two hands, and held out her forehead to be kissed.
No allusion to Christina had passed between them since the day they met her at Saint Peter’s, but he knew that she knew, by that infallible sixth sense of a woman who loves, that this strange, beautiful girl had the power to injure her.
She is extremely clever, too.” “Oh, incontestably.” “She has beautiful dresses.” “Yes, any number of them.” “And beautiful manners.” “Yes--sometimes.” “And plenty of money.” “Money enough, apparently.” “And she receives great admiration.” “Very true.” “And she is to marry a prince.” “So they say.” Miss Garland rose and turned to rejoin her companions, commenting these admissions with a pregnant silence.
He apparently desired to intimate that the solemnity of his errand left him no breath for idle smoke-puffings.
But the Cavaliere continued: “Miss Light has committed a great crime; she has plunged a dagger into the heart of her mother.” “A dagger!” cried Rowland.
“It was a magnificent marriage,” he said, solemnly.
He was on the point of charging him with his inconsistency, when Giacosa resumed: “But if the marriage can be saved, it must be saved.
It ‘s a beautiful marriage.
I shall wait a while; I shall bide my time.” “And then?” “And then that transcendent girl will confess to me that when she threw overboard her prince she remembered that I adored her!” “I feel bound to tell you,” was in the course of a moment Rowland’s response to this speech, “that I am now on my way to Mrs. Light’s.” “I congratulate you, I envy you!” Roderick murmured, imperturbably.
Rowland greatly pitied her, for there is something respectable in passionate grief, even in a very bad cause; and as pity is akin to love, he endured her rather better than he had done hitherto.
Oh, the money, alone, that I have put into this thing, would melt the heart of a Turk!” During this frenzied outbreak Rowland had had time to look round the room, and to see the Cavaliere sitting in a corner, like a major-domo on the divan of an antechamber, pale, rigid, and inscrutable.
“I have it at heart to tell you,” Rowland said, “that if you consider my friend Hudson”-- Mrs. Light gave a toss of her head and hands.
He has stood there where you stand--there, with his name and his millions and his devotion--as white as your handkerchief, with hot tears in his eyes, and me ready to go down on my knees to him and say, ‘My own sweet prince, I could kiss the ground you tread on, but it is n’t decent that I should allow you to enter my house and expose yourself to these horrors again.’ And he would come back, and he would come back, and go through it all again, and take all that was given him, and only want the girl the more!
I seized him once and kissed him, I did!
“I ‘m sorry your heart is not so tender as your conscience.
I said to myself, ‘She, in my place, would n’t marry Casamassima.’ I could not help saying it, and I said it so often that I found a kind of inspiration in it.
The end of it all was that I found it impossible not to tell the prince that I was his very humble servant, but that I could not marry him.” “Are you sure it was only of Miss Garland’s character that you were jealous, not of--not of”-- “Speak out, I beg you.
We are talking philosophy!” “Not of her affection for her cousin?” “Sure is a good deal to ask.
There are two reasons; one, at least, I can tell you: her affection has not a shadow’s weight with Mr. Hudson!
I don’t love him.
I have something here, here, here!” and she patted her heart.
I like him very much.” “Would you marry him if he were to ask you?” “He has asked me.” “And if he asks again?” “I shall marry no one just now.” “Roderick,” said Rowland, “has great hopes.” “Does he know of my rupture with the prince?” “He is making a great holiday of it.” Christina pulled her poodle towards her and began to smooth his silky fleece.
I meant as a lover.
One does n’t want a lover one pities, and one does n’t want--of all things in the world--a picturesque husband!
I wish he were my brother, so that he could never talk to me of marriage.
Then I could adore him.
She does n’t love the prince; she has let the matter stand or fall by that.” The old man grasped him by the hand and stood a moment with averted eyes.
This one opposes Miss Light, the other adores her!
Christina Light was married this morning to Prince Casamassima.” Rowland did not shout at all; he gave a deep, short murmur: “Married--this morning?” “Married this morning, at seven o’clock, le plus tranquillement du monde, before three or four persons.
Madame Grandoni acknowledged an extreme curiosity as to the secret springs of these strange doings: Casamassima’s sudden dismissal, his still more sudden recall, the hurried private marriage.
Is it not possible that the late Mr. Light had made an outbreak before witnesses who are still living?” “Certainly her marriage now,” said Madame Grandoni, less analytically, “has the advantage that it takes her away from her--parents!” This lady’s farther comments upon the event are not immediately pertinent to our history; there were some other comments of which Rowland had a deeply oppressive foreboding.
You can’t help me, poor mother--not with kisses, nor tears, nor prayers!
Mary Garland quickly left her place, came straight to Roderick, and laid her hand on his arm, looking at him with all her tormented heart in her eyes.
Rowland had been living for the past month in such intolerable expectancy of disaster that now that the ice was broken, and the fatal plunge taken, his foremost feeling was almost elation; but in a moment his orderly instincts and his natural love of superficial smoothness overtook it.
She pretended to care greatly for all this, and to be willing to make any sacrifice in return; she had a magnificent chance, for she was being forced into a mercenary marriage with a man she detested.
She ‘s a ravenous flirt, and why a flirt is a flirt is more than I can tell you.
“Roderick says he does n’t know, he does n’t care,” Mrs. Hudson said; “he leaves it entirely to you.” Many another man, in Rowland’s place, would have greeted this information with an irate and sarcastic laugh, and told his visitors that he thanked them infinitely for their confidence, but that, really, as things stood now, they must settle these matters between themselves; many another man might have so demeaned himself, even if, like Rowland, he had been in love with Mary Garland and pressingly conscious that her destiny was also part of the question.
When she asked him what he meant, he said he really could n’t tell her, and parted from her with much genuine emotion; the more so, doubtless, that she blessed him in a quite loving, maternal fashion, and told him she honestly believed him to be the best fellow in the world.
But it hardly mattered, for if, as was more than probable, Miss Garland had peremptorily released her cousin, her own heart had by no means recovered its liberty.
There are women whose love is care-taking and patronizing, and who rather prefer a weak man because he gives them a comfortable sense of strength.
It did not in the least please Rowland to believe that Mary Garland was one of these; for he held that such women were only males in petticoats, and he was convinced that Miss Garland’s heart was constructed after the most perfect feminine model.
Miss Garland had even in her face and carriage something of the preoccupied and wearied look of a person who is watching at a sick-bed; Roderick’s broken fortunes, his dead ambitions, were a cruel burden to the heart of a girl who had believed that he possessed “genius,” and supposed that genius was to one’s spiritual economy what full pockets were to one’s domestic.
This happened in the court of the villa--the large gray quadrangle, overstretched, from edge to edge of the red-tiled roof, by the soft Italian sky.
She asked fewer questions than before, and seemed to have lost heart for consulting guide-books and encyclopaedias.
Roderick might fall in love with whom he pleased; no doubt that women trained in the mysterious Roman arts were only too proud and too happy to make it easy for him; and it was very presuming in poor, plain Mary to feel any personal resentment.
I feel as if I were saying something sinful--I love it!” “If it is sinful, I absolve you,” said Rowland, “in so far as I have power.
Roderick turned to his friend, stretching his two hands out toward the lake and mountains, and shaking them with an eloquent gesture, as if his heart was too full for utterance.
Something in my heart seemed suddenly to open and let in a flood of beauty and desire.
Say that he trembled in every nerve with a sense of the beauty and sweetness of life; that he rebelled and protested and shrieked; that he was buried alive, with his eyes open, and his heart beating to madness; that he clung to every blade of grass and every way-side thorn as he passed; that it was the most horrible spectacle you ever witnessed; that it was an outrage, a murder, a massacre!” “Good heavens, man, are you insane?” Rowland cried.
I know it in every pulse of my heart!
Rowland knew that she loved nature, but he was struck afresh with the vivacity of her observation of it, and with her knowledge of plants and stones.
He felt that it was physically possible to say, “Because I love you!” but that it was not morally possible.
If some day she had declared, in a sudden burst of passion, that she was outwearied and sickened, and that she gave up her recreant lover, Rowland’s expectation would have gone half-way to meet her.
There were girls, indeed, whose fineness, like that of Burd Helen in the ballad, lay in clinging to the man of their love through thick and thin, and in bowing their head to all hard usage.
Are you not finding that your affection for Miss Garland has a permanent quality which you rather underestimated?” “I don’t pretend to say.
Of course, marrying such a useless lout as I am is out of the question for any woman, and I should pay Miss Garland a poor compliment to assume that she is in a hurry to celebrate our nuptials.” “Oh, you ‘re in love!” said Rowland, not very logically.
He did not believe that his companion was in love; he had argued the false to learn the true.
It was true that she herself helped him little to definite conclusions, and that he remained in puzzled doubt as to whether these happy touches were still a matter of the heart, or had become simply a matter of the conscience.
To please me she promised not to marry till I gave her leave.
I was not in a marrying way myself, but it was damnation to think of another man possessing her.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>And yet in three months she could hardly have changed; the change was in Rowland’s own vision of her, which that last interview, on the eve of her marriage, had made unprecedentedly tender.
How did Mr. Hudson receive the news of my marriage?” “Very badly,” said Rowland.
“Your mother, I hope, is well.” “My mother is in the enjoyment of superb health, and may be seen every evening at the Casino, at the Baths of Lucca, confiding to every new-comer that she has married her daughter to a pearl of a prince.” Rowland was anxious for news of Mrs. Light’s companion, and the natural course was frankly to inquire about him.
He is a very good old man!” “I have a great regard for him,” said Rowland, gravely, at the same time that he privately wondered whether the Cavaliere’s pension was paid by Prince Casamassima for services rendered in connection with his marriage.
So long as she had been free to choose, she had esteemed him: but from the moment she was forced to marry him she had detested him.
I only know that she makes my heart beat, makes me see visions.” “You feel encouraged?” “I feel excited.” “You are really looking better.” “I am glad to hear it.
I don’t say she was dying of love for you, but she took a fancy to you.” “We will let this pass!” said Rowland, after a silence.
How do you know whether I have loved or suffered?
I loved quite as well as you; indeed, I think I may say rather better.
I have been a good friend to Christina Light, and it seems to me my friendship does her quite as much honor as your love!” “Your love--your suffering--your silence--your friendship!” cried Roderick.
Suffering all the while?” “Yes, you may call it suffering.” “Why did you never tell me all this before?” “Because my affection was always stronger than my resentment; because I preferred to err on the side of kindness; because I had, myself, in a measure, launched you in the world and thrown you into temptations; and because nothing short of your unwarrantable aggression just now could have made me say these painful things.” Roderick picked up a blade of long grass and began to bite it; Rowland was puzzled by his expression and manner.
“And all this time,” Roderick continued, “you have been in love?
But I never dreamed you were in love with her.
And then suddenly, looking about at the menacing sky and motionless air, “It ‘s this horrible day!” Rowland that afternoon tried to write a letter to his cousin Cecilia, but his head and his heart were alike heavy, and he traced upon the paper but a single line.
But nevertheless, thought Rowland, the cry had come, her heart had spoken; her first impulse had been to sacrifice him.
Mrs. Hudson tottered forward with outstretched hands and the expression of a blind person; but before she reached her son, Mary Garland had rushed past her, and, in the face of the staring, pitying, awe-stricken crowd, had flung herself, with the magnificent movement of one whose rights were supreme, and with a loud, tremendous cry, upon the senseless vestige of her love.

jude_the_obscure

My niece and her husband, after they were married, didn’ get a house of their own for some year or more; and then they only had one till—Well, I won’t go into that.
Jude, my child, don’t you ever marry.
He sounded the clacker till his arm ached, and at length his heart grew sympathetic with the birds’ thwarted desires.
“I—I sir—only meant that—there was a good crop in the ground—I saw ’em sow it—and the rooks could have a little bit for dinner—and you wouldn’t miss it, sir—and Mr. Phillotson said I was to be kind to ’em—oh, oh, oh!” This truthful explanation seemed to exasperate the farmer even more than if Jude had stoutly denied saying anything at all, and he still smacked the whirling urchin, the clacks of the instrument continuing to resound all across the field and as far as the ears of distant workers—who gathered thereupon that Jude was pursuing his business of clacking with great assiduity—and echoing from the brand-new church tower just behind the mist, towards the building of which structure the farmer had largely subscribed, to testify his love for God and man.
“The place I mean is that one yonder.” He was getting so romantically attached to Christminster that, like a young lover alluding to his mistress, he felt bashful at mentioning its name again.
Jude, throwing a last adoring look at the distant halo, turned and walked beside his remarkably well-informed friend, who had no objection to telling him as they moved on more yet of the city—its towers and halls and churches.
It had been the yearning of his heart to find something to anchor on, to cling to—for some place which he could call admirable.
Then a private resident of an adjoining place informed the local policeman that the baker’s boy should not be allowed to read while driving, and insisted that it was the constable’s duty to catch him in the act, and take him to the police court at Alfredston, and get him fined for dangerous practices on the highway.
Certainly there seemed little harmony between this pagan literature and the mediæval colleges at Christminster, that ecclesiastical romance in stone.
Ultimately he decided that in his sheer love of reading he had taken up a wrong emotion for a Christian young man.
On one of these pilgrimages he met with a hunch-backed old woman of great intelligence, who read everything she could lay her hands on, and she told him more yet of the romantic charms of the city of light and lore.
and it is that which tells… Yes, Christminster shall be my Alma Mater; and I’ll be her beloved son, in whom she shall be well pleased.” In his deep concentration on these transactions of the future Jude’s walk had slackened, and he was now standing quite still, looking at the ground as though the future were thrown thereon by a magic lantern.
Jude Fawley shouldered his tool-basket and resumed his lonely way, filled with an ardour at which he mentally stood at gaze.
I could see it as you courted on the bridge, when he looked at ’ee as if he had never seen a woman before in his born days.
This seemed to care little for his reason and his will, nothing for his so-called elevated intentions, and moved him along, as a violent schoolmaster a schoolboy he has seized by the collar, in a direction which tended towards the embrace of a woman for whom he had no respect, and whose life had nothing in common with his own except locality.
He was going to walk with her, perhaps kiss her; but “courting” was too coolly purposeful to be anything but repugnant to his ideas.
He talked the commonest local twaddle to Arabella with greater zest than he would have felt in discussing all the philosophies with all the Dons in the recently adored university, and passed the spot where he had knelt to Diana and Phœbus without remembering that there were any such people in the mythology, or that the sun was anything else than a useful lamp for illuminating Arabella’s face.
Jude took the hint, and encircling her waist with his arm, pulled her to him and kissed her.
When they were half-way up the long hill they paused as by arrangement, and he kissed her again.
They reached the top, and he kissed her once more.
It was nine o’clock when, with another embrace, he stood to deliver her up at her father’s door.
It was better to love a woman than to be a graduate, or a parson; ay, or a pope!
Retracing by the light of dawn the road he had followed a few hours earlier under cover of darkness, with his sweetheart by his side, he reached the bottom of the hill, where he walked slowly, and stood still.
He was on the spot where he had given her the first kiss.
She was not there now, and “the embroidery of imagination upon the stuff of nature” so depicted her past presence that a void was in his heart which nothing could fill.
She passed unheedingly the scene of the kiss, and the willow that marked it, though chattering freely on the subject to the other two.
But I want him to more than care for me; I want him to have me—to marry me!
“On my word I don’t!—No further, that is, than by plain courting, and taking care he don’t go too far!” The third girl looked at the second.
Lots of girls do it; or do you think they’d get married at all?” Arabella pursued her way in silent thought.
The lines of her countenance changed from the rigidity of business to the softness of love when she saw Jude, and she bent her eyes languishingly upon him.
“They were only put in this morning!” she cried, stimulated to pursue in spite of her lover’s presence.
Every now and then they ran together, when he caught her for a moment and kissed her.
“Get up, Abby.” “Why?” “I want you to let me kiss you.
“What is it?” said her lover.
They looked at each other, panting; till he rose and said: “One kiss, now I can do it without damage to property; and I’ll go!” But she had jumped up too.
Her lover followed her as she withdrew.
You _know_ I wouldn’t desert you!” “Well then—” “I have next to no wages as yet, you know; or perhaps I should have thought of this before… But, of course if that’s the case, we must marry!
Of course I never dreamt six months ago, or even three, of marrying.
Certainly we’ll marry: we must!” That night he went out alone, and walked in the dark self-communing.
Those who guessed the probable state of affairs, Arabella’s parents being among them, declared that it was the sort of conduct they would have expected of such an honest young man as Jude in reparation of the wrong he had done his innocent sweetheart.
The parson who married them seemed to think it satisfactory too.
Of this cake Arabella took some slices, wrapped them up in white note-paper, and sent them to her companions in the pork-dressing business, Anny and Sarah, labelling each packet “_In remembrance of good advice_.” The prospects of the newly married couple were certainly not very brilliant even to the most sanguine mind.
So to the cottage he took her on the evening of the marriage, giving up his old room at his aunt’s—where so much of the hard labour at Greek and Latin had been carried on.
I don’t think they improve a woman—particularly a married woman, and of full-sized figure like you.” “Most men think otherwise.” “I don’t care what most men think, if they do.
I thought when I married you that you had always lived in your father’s house.” “You ought to have known better than that, and seen I was a little more finished than I could have been by staying where I was born.
There was perhaps something fortunate in the fact that the immediate reason of his marriage had proved to be non-existent.
But the marriage remained.
“Well done, young married volk!
The white snow, stained with the blood of his fellow-mortal, wore an illogical look to him as a lover of justice, not to say a Christian; but he could not see how the matter was to be mended.
The wayside objects reminded him so much of his courtship of his wife that, to keep them out of his eyes, he read whenever he could as he walked to and from his work.
On entering and sitting down the sight of the picture of Samson and Delilah on the wall caused him to recognize the place as that he had visited with Arabella on that first Sunday evening of their courtship.
I The next noteworthy move in Jude’s life was that in which he appeared gliding steadily onward through a dusky landscape of some three years’ later leafage than had graced his courtship of Arabella, and the disruption of his coarse conjugal life with her.
He had at last found himself clear of Marygreen and Alfredston: he was out of his apprenticeship, and with his tools at his back seemed to be in the way of making a new start—the start to which, barring the interruption involved in his intimacy and married experience with Arabella, he had been looking forward for about ten years.
The breeze ruffled and fluttered it, but he could see enough to decide on the direction he should take to reach the heart of the place.
Of them he had an ample band—some men of heart, others rather men of head; he who apologized for the Church in Latin; the saintly author of the Evening Hymn; and near them the great itinerant preacher, hymn-writer, and zealot, shadowed like Jude by his matrimonial difficulties.
He likewise heard some phrases spoken by the phantom with the short face, the genial Spectator: “When I look upon the tombs of the great, every motion of envy dies in me; when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out; when I meet with the grief of parents upon a tombstone, my heart melts with compassion; when I see the tombs of the parents themselves, I consider the vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow.” And lastly a gentle-voiced prelate spoke, during whose meek, familiar rhyme, endeared to him from earliest childhood, Jude fell asleep: Teach me to live, that I may dread The grave as little as my bed.
Jude, a ridiculously affectionate fellow, promised nothing, put the photograph on the mantel-piece, kissed it—he did not know why—and felt more at home.
Having been deeply encumbered by marrying, getting a cottage, and buying the furniture which had disappeared in the wake of his wife, he had never been able to save any money since the time of those disastrous ventures, and till his wages began to come in he was obliged to live in the narrowest way.
The first reason was that he was married, and it would be wrong.
It was not well for cousins to fall in love even when circumstances seemed to favour the passion.
The third: even were he free, in a family like his own where marriage usually meant a tragic sadness, marriage with a blood-relation would duplicate the adverse conditions, and a tragic sadness might be intensified to a tragic horror.
After carrying them along a little way openly an idea came to her, and, pulling some huge burdock leaves, parsley, and other rank growths from the hedge, she wrapped up her burden as well as she could in these, so that what she carried appeared to be an enormous armful of green stuff gathered by a zealous lover of nature.
She wore a cross and beads round her neck as her only ornament, and knew the Christian Year by heart.
Those three enormous reasons why he must not attempt intimate acquaintance with Sue Bridehead, now that his interest in her had shown itself to be unmistakably of a sexual kind, loomed as stubbornly as ever.
But it was also obvious that man could not live by work alone; that the particular man Jude, at any rate, wanted something to love.
For Sue to be the loved one of a man who was licensed by the laws of his country to love Arabella and none other unto his life’s end, was a pretty bad second beginning when the man was bent on such a course as Jude purposed.
It was quite impossible, he found, to ask to be delivered from temptation when your heart’s desire was to be tempted unto seventy times seven.
I can see that she is exceptionally bright; and it is partly a wish for intellectual sympathy, and a craving for loving-kindness in my solitude.” Thus he went on adoring her, fearing to realize that it was human perversity.
For whatever Sue’s virtues, talents, or ecclesiastical saturation, it was certain that those items were not at all the cause of his affection for her.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“I am sorry that I asked you to meet me, and didn’t call,” began Jude with the bashfulness of a lover.
It was with heart-sickness he perceived that, while her sentiments towards him were those of the frankest friendliness only, he loved her more than before becoming acquainted with her; and the gloom of the walk home lay not in the night overhead, but in the thought of her departure.
It did not occur for a moment to the schoolmaster and recluse that Jude’s ardour in promoting the arrangement arose from any other feelings towards Sue than the instinct of co-operation common among members of the same family.
The trees overhead deepened the gloom of the hour, and they dripped sadly upon him, impressing him with forebodings—illogical forebodings; for though he knew that he loved her he also knew that he could not be more to her than he was.
“Oh, he’s too old for her—too old!” cried Jude in all the terrible sickness of hopeless, handicapped love.
Phillotson was perhaps twenty years her senior, but many a happy marriage had been made in such conditions of age.
VI Jude’s old and embittered aunt lay unwell at Marygreen, and on the following Sunday he went to see her—a visit which was the result of a victorious struggle against his inclination to turn aside to the village of Lumsdon and obtain a miserable interview with his cousin, in which the word nearest his heart could not be spoken, and the sight which had tortured him could not be revealed.
“Don’t you be a fool about her!” “No, no, of course not.” “Your marrying that woman Arabella was about as bad a thing as a man could possibly do for himself by trying hard.
But ’a wouldn’t come.” These retrospective visions of Sue only made Jude the more miserable that he was unable to woo her, and he left the cottage of his aunt that day with a heavy heart.
And the tender relations between Phillotson and the young girl of whom Jude was passionately enamoured effectually made it repugnant to Jude’s tastes to apply to Phillotson for advice on his own scheme.
He looked over the town into the country beyond, to the trees which screened her whose presence had at first been the support of his heart, and whose loss was now a maddening torture.
Here the two sexes had met for loving, hating, coupling, parting; had waited, had suffered, for each other; had triumphed over each other; cursed each other in jealousy, blessed each other in forgiveness.
The spirit of Sue seemed to hover round him and prevent his flirting and drinking with the frolicsome girls who made advances—wistful to gain a little joy.
That the one affined soul he had ever met was lost to him through his marriage returned upon him with cruel persistency, till, unable to bear it longer, he again rushed for distraction to the real Christminster life.
He now sought it out in an obscure and low-ceiled tavern up a court which was well known to certain worthies of the place, and in brighter times would have interested him simply by its quaintness.
“I am so wicked, Sue—my heart is nearly broken, and I could not bear my life as it was!
It _was_ hell—“the hell of conscious failure,” both in ambition and in love.
But that much he conceded to human frailty, and hoped to learn to love her only as a friend and kinswoman.
He packed up his things and went to Melchester with a lighter heart than he had known for months.
She had come forward prettily, but Jude felt that she had hardly expected him to kiss her, as he was burning to do, under other colours than those of cousinship.
He could not perceive the least sign that Sue regarded him as a lover, or ever would do so, now that she knew the worst of him, even if he had the right to behave as one; and this helped on his growing resolve to tell her of his matrimonial entanglement, which he had put off doing from time to time in sheer dread of losing the bliss of her company.
“I had a suspicion, a fear,” said Jude, “that he—cared about you rather warmly, and perhaps wanted to marry you.” “Now don’t be such a silly boy!” “He has said something about it, I expect.” “If he had, what would it matter?
And I know what I saw him doing—” “Not kissing me—that I’m certain!” “No.
“This is what I have done: I have promised—I have promised—that I will marry him when I come out of the training-school two years hence, and have got my certificate; his plan being that we shall then take a large double school in a great town—he the boys’ and I the girls’—as married school-teachers often do, and make a good income between us.” “Oh, Sue!
Jude had a conviction that his unhappy visit to her on that sad night had precipitated this marriage engagement, and it did anything but add to his happiness.
His combined bed and sitting-room was furnished with framed photographs of the rectories and deaneries at which his landlady had lived as trusted servant in her time, and the parlour downstairs bore a clock on the mantelpiece inscribed to the effect that it was presented to the same serious-minded woman by her fellow-servants on the occasion of her marriage.
’Tis hard lying, rather, but volk may do worse.” He turned to Jude and asked privately: “Be you a married couple?” “Hsh—no!” said Jude.
The fact was that, only twelve months before, there had occurred a lamentable seduction of one of the pupils who had made the same statement in order to gain meetings with her lover.
Some of the students, who had seen Jude from the window, felt that they would not mind risking her punishment for the pleasure of being kissed by such a kindly-faced young man.
Sitting in his only arm-chair he saw a slim and fragile being masquerading as himself on a Sunday, so pathetic in her defencelessness that his heart felt big with the sense of it.
He wanted me to be his mistress, in fact, but I wasn’t in love with him—and on my saying I should go away if he didn’t agree to _my_ plan, he did so.
He said I was breaking his heart by holding out against him so long at such close quarters; he could never have believed it of woman.
He left me a little money—because I broke his heart, I suppose.
“But I have never yielded myself to any lover, if that’s what you mean!
Some of the most passionately erotic poets have been the most self-contained in their daily lives.” “Have you told Mr. Phillotson about this university scholar friend?” “Yes—long ago.
His heart bumped, and he made no reply.
I _hate_ such hum-bug as could attempt to plaster over with ecclesiastical abstractions such ecstatic, natural, human love as lies in that great and passionate song!” Her speech had grown spirited, and almost petulant at his rebuke, and her eyes moist.
What I insist on is, that to explain such verses as this: ‘Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women?’ by the note: ‘_The Church professeth her faith_,’ is supremely ridiculous!” “Well then, let it be!
Was it that which had broken the heart of the poor leader-writer; and was he to be the next one?
And you mustn’t!” “What?” “You mustn’t love me.
_If you want to love me, Jude, you may_: I don’t mind at all; and I’ll never say again that you mustn’t!
“I vowed I never would tell you, Jude—it is so vulgar and distressing!” “Is it about us?” “Yes.” “But do tell me!” “Well—somebody has sent them baseless reports about us, and they say you and I ought to marry as soon as possible, for the sake of my reputation!
But my marrying you, dear Jude—why, of course, if I had reckoned upon marrying you I shouldn’t have come to you so often!
And I never supposed you thought of such a thing as marrying me till the other evening; when I began to fancy you did love me a little.
Perhaps I ought not to have been so intimate with you.
Oh, you have been unkind to me—you have—to look upon me as a sweetheart without saying a word, and leaving me to discover it myself!
By every law of nature and sex a kiss was the only rejoinder that fitted the mood and the moment, under the suasion of which Sue’s undemonstrative regard of him might not inconceivably have changed its temperature.
But I shouldn’t care if he didn’t come any more!” It was very perplexing to her lover that she should be piqued at his honest acquiescence in his rival, if Jude’s feelings of love were deprecated by her.
Sue’s kind hostess now returned from church, and there was no more intimate conversation.
Essentially an unpractical man, he was now bent on making and saving money for a practical purpose—that of keeping a wife, who, if she chose, might conduct one of the girls’ schools adjoining his own; for which purpose he had advised her to go into training, since she would not marry him offhand.
What precise shade of satisfaction was to be gathered from a woman’s gratitude that the man who loved her had not been often to see her?
Phillotson brought it half-way to his lips, but withdrew it in doubt at her perplexing phrases: ultimately kissing the dead pasteboard with all the passionateness, and more than all the devotion, of a young man of eighteen.
Sue had, in fact, never written a line to her suitor on the subject, although it was fourteen days old.
He sat down on a block of freestone, regardless of the dusty imprint it made on his breeches; and his listless eyes following the movements of the workmen he presently became aware that the reputed culprit, Sue’s lover Jude, was one amongst them.
Having inadvertently witnessed Phillotson’s tentative courtship of Sue in the lane there had grown up in the younger man’s mind a curious dislike to think of the elder, to meet him, to communicate in any way with him; and since Phillotson’s success in obtaining at least her promise had become known to Jude, he had frankly recognized that he did not wish to see or hear of his senior any more, learn anything of his pursuits, or even imagine again what excellencies might appertain to his character.
By the exercise of that treachery which love for the same woman renders possible to men the most honourable in every other relation of life, he could send off Phillotson in agony and defeat by saying that the scandal was true, and that Sue had irretrievably committed herself with him.
You know what they say?—that I ought to marry her.” “What!” “And I wish with all my soul I could!” Phillotson trembled, and his naturally pale face acquired a corpselike sharpness in its lines.
I mean that were I in a position to marry her, or someone, and settle down, instead of living in lodgings here and there, I should be glad!” What he had really meant was simply that he loved her.
When Jude went to his dinner at one he saw his beloved ahead of him in the street leading up from the North Gate, walking as if no way looking for him.
But he did not speak, and she continued: “It was that which made me write and say—I didn’t mind your loving me—if you wanted to, much!” The exultation he might have felt at what that implied, or seemed to imply, was nullified by his intention, and he rested rigid till he began: “I have never told you—” “Yes you have,” murmured she.
Could she possibly know of that morning performance of his with Arabella; which in a few months had ceased to be a marriage more completely than by death?
He would have preferred a more congenial spot, but, as usually happens, in place of a romantic field or solemn aisle for his tale, it was told while they walked up and down over a floor littered with rotten cabbage-leaves, and amid all the usual squalors of decayed vegetable matter and unsaleable refuse.
He began and finished his brief narrative, which merely led up to the information that he had married a wife some years earlier, and that his wife was living still.
She was his comrade, friend, unconscious sweetheart no longer; and her eyes regarded him in estranged silence.
“I was ashamed of the episode in my life which brought about the marriage,” he continued.
“Here I have been saying, or writing, that—that you might love me, or something of the sort!—just out of charity—and all the time—oh, it is perfectly damnable how things are!” she said, stamping her foot in a nervous quiver.
Now if I had done such a thing it would have been different, and not remarkable, for I at least don’t regard marriage as a sacrament.
But you must treat me as you will!” When she saw how wretched he was she softened, and trying to blink away her sympathetic tears said with all the winning reproachfulness of a heart-hurt woman: “Ah—you should have told me before you gave me that idea that you wanted to be allowed to love me!
It was distracting to Jude, and his heart would have ached less had she appeared anyhow but as she did appear; essentially large-minded and generous on reflection, despite a previous exercise of those narrow womanly humours on impulse that were necessary to give her sex.
This is the only obstacle.” “You forget that I must have loved you, and wanted to be your wife, even if there had been no obstacle,” said Sue, with a gentle seriousness which did not reveal her mind.
“And then we are cousins, and it is bad for cousins to marry.
Mr. Phillotson and I are to be married quite soon—in three or four weeks.
Remember I say you are to, and you mustn’t refuse!—Your affectionate cousin, SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD.
“You don’t know what marriage means!” Could it be possible that his announcement of his own marriage had pricked her on to this, just as his visit to her when in liquor may have pricked her on to her engagement?
To be sure, there seemed to exist these other and sufficient reasons, practical and social, for her decision; but Sue was not a very practical or calculating person; and he was compelled to think that a pique at having his secret sprung upon her had moved her to give way to Phillotson’s probable representations, that the best course to prove how unfounded were the suspicions of the school authorities would be to marry him off-hand, as in fulfilment of an ordinary engagement.
I have nobody else who could do it so conveniently as you, being the only married relation I have here on the spot, even if my father were friendly enough to be willing, which he isn’t.
I have been looking at the marriage service in the prayer-book, and it seems to me very humiliating that a giver-away should be required at all.
What I suggest is that, as you have no house of your own, you do not marry from your school friend’s, but from mine.
Surely you care a bit about me still!—Ever your affectionate, JUDE.
What had jarred on him even more than the signature was a little sting he had been silent on—the phrase “married relation”—What an idiot it made him seem as her lover!
What oppressed Jude was the thought that, having done a wrong thing of this sort himself, he was aiding and abetting the woman he loved in doing a like wrong thing, instead of imploring and warning her against it.
“Where I am going to be married?” “Yes.” “Indeed!” she exclaimed with curiosity.
“How I should like to go in and see what the spot is like where I am so soon to kneel and do it.” Again he said to himself, “She does not realize what marriage means!” He passively acquiesced in her wish to go in, and they entered by the western door.
Sue still held Jude’s arm, almost as if she loved him.
They strolled undemonstratively up the nave towards the altar railing, which they stood against in silence, turning then and walking down the nave again, her hand still on his arm, precisely like a couple just married.
I shall walk down the church like this with my husband in about two hours, shan’t I!” “No doubt you will!” “Was it like this when you were married?” “Good God, Sue—don’t be so awfully merciless!
Will you both come to the shop with me?” “No,” said Sue, “I’ll go on to the house with him”; and requesting her lover not to be a long time she departed with the schoolmaster.
That he adored Sue was obvious; and she could almost be seen to feel that she was undeserving his adoration.
When they had passed up the church and were standing in their places Jude found that the antecedent visit had certainly taken off the edge of this performance, but by the time they were half-way on with the service he wished from his heart that he had not undertaken the business of giving her away.
Was it that they were, instead of more sensitive, as reputed, more callous, and less romantic; or were they more heroic?
VIII Jude wondered if she had really left her handkerchief behind; or whether it were that she had miserably wished to tell him of a love that at the last moment she could not bring herself to express.
Gladly would he have compounded for the denial of her as a sweetheart and wife by having her live thus as a fellow-lodger and friend, even on the most distant terms.
“If at the estrangement or death of my lost love, I could go and see her child—hers solely—there would be comfort in it!” said Jude.
The oppressive strength of his affection for Sue showed itself on the morrow and following days yet more clearly.
“What made you part from him?” “Don’t you ask questions, and you won’t hear lies.” “Come then, give me my change, which you’ve been keeping from me for the last quarter of an hour; and I’ll romantically vanish up the street of this picturesque city.” She handed the change over the counter, in taking which he caught her fingers and held them.
Arabella was perhaps an intended intervention to punish him for his unauthorized love.
“Of course I don’t want to reveal your secrets.” “Whenever I met him out for a walk, he used to say that he was much taken with my looks, and he kept pressing me to marry him.
He was very fond of me, and we lived honourable enough, and as respectable as any married couple in the colony!

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Then she flushed as she observed his thought that they had not met since her marriage.
I had an appointment at nine o’clock—too late for me to catch the train that would have met yours, or to get home at all.” Looking at his loved one as she appeared to him now, in his tender thought the sweetest and most disinterested comrade that he had ever had, living largely in vivid imaginings, so ethereal a creature that her spirit could be seen trembling through her limbs, he felt heartily ashamed of his earthliness in spending the hours he had spent in Arabella’s company.
“Sue—you are married now, you know, like me; and yet we have been in such a hurry that we have not said a word about it!” “There’s no necessity,” she quickly returned.
But the latter’s final announcement of her marriage in Australia bewildered him lest what he might say should do his ignorant wife an injury.
I know!” There was something in her face which belied her late assuring words, so strictly proper and so lifelessly spoken that they might have been taken from a list of model speeches in “The Wife’s Guide to Conduct.” Jude knew the quality of every vibration in Sue’s voice, could read every symptom of her mental condition; and he was convinced that she was unhappy, although she had not been a month married.
… Ah—you’ll rue this marrying as well as he!” she added, turning to Sue.
What made ’ee marry him?” “What makes most women marry, Aunt?” “Ah!
You mean to say you loved the man!” “I don’t meant to say anything definite.” “Do ye love un?” “Don’t ask me, Aunt.” “I can mind the man very well.
“That I ought—perhaps I ought not to have married!” He wondered if she had really been going to say that at first.
They went back, and the subject was smoothed over, and her aunt took rather kindly to Sue, telling her that not many young women newly married would have come so far to see a sick old crone like her.
He passed the evening and following days in mortifying by every possible means his wish to see her, nearly starving himself in attempts to extinguish by fasting his passionate tendency to love her.
Arabella informed him that a few days after their parting in the morning at Christminster, she had been surprised by an affectionate letter from her Australian husband, formerly manager of the hotel in Sydney.
As he had said that he loved her very much still, and implored her to tell him where she was, and as they had only parted in a slight tiff, and as her engagement in Christminster was only temporary, she had just gone to join him as he urged.
She could not help feeling that she belonged to him more than to Jude, since she had properly married him, and had lived with him much longer than with her first husband.
This man of soul would understand scant ceremony, and might be quite a perfect adviser in a case in which an earthly and illegitimate passion had cunningly obtained entrance into his heart through the opening afforded for religion.
The hour was too early; the pupils were still in school, humming small, like a swarm of gnats; and he withdrew a few steps along Abbey Walk, whence he regarded the spot which fate had made the home of all he loved best in the world.
Within the mullioned and transomed windows he could see the black, brown, and flaxen crowns of the scholars over the sills, and to pass the time away he walked down to the level terrace where the abbey gardens once had spread, his heart throbbing in spite of him.
Jude grasped it—just as he had done before her marriage.
“It is odd,” she said, in a voice quite changed, “that I should care about that air; because—” “Because what?” “I am not that sort—quite.” “Not easily moved?” “I didn’t quite mean that.” “Oh, but you _are_ one of that sort, for you are just like me at heart!” “But not at head.” She played on and suddenly turned round; and by an unpremeditated instinct each clasped the other’s hand again.
“Sue, I sometimes think you are a flirt,” said he abruptly.
Some women’s love of being loved is insatiable; and so, often, is their love of loving; and in the last case they may find that they can’t give it continuously to the chamber-officer appointed by the bishop’s licence to receive it.
“She was opposed to marriage, from first to last, you say?” murmured Sue.
“Is it wrong, Jude,” she said with a tentative tremor, “for a husband or wife to tell a third person that they are unhappy in their marriage?
If a marriage ceremony is a religious thing, it is possibly wrong; but if it is only a sordid contract, based on material convenience in householding, rating, and taxing, and the inheritance of land and money by children, making it necessary that the male parent should be known—which it seems to be—why surely a person may say, even proclaim upon the housetops, that it hurts and grieves him or her?” “I have said so, anyhow, to you.” Presently she went on: “Are there many couples, do you think, where one dislikes the other for no definite fault?” “Yes, I suppose.
“How can a woman be unhappy who has only been married eight weeks to a man she chose freely?” “‘Chose freely!’” “Why do you repeat it?
Your part is that you ought not to have married him.
I have no feelings of love left in me.” “That’s news.
How could your heart go back to Arabella so soon?” “A special Providence, I suppose, helped it on its way.” “Ah—it isn’t true!” she said with gentle resentment.
… Do you think, Jude, that a man ought to marry a woman his own age, or one younger than himself—eighteen years—as I am than he?” “It depends upon what they feel for each other.” He gave her no opportunity of self-satisfaction, and she had to go on unaided, which she did in a vanquished tone, verging on tears: “I—I think I must be equally honest with you as you have been with me.
“I have only been married a month or two!” she went on, still remaining bent upon the table, and sobbing into her hands.
It all arose through my being married before we met, didn’t it?
I know you, with your religious doctrines, think that a married woman in trouble of a kind like mine commits a mortal sin in making a man the confidant of it, as I did you.
But—I am _so glad_ to see you!—and, oh, I didn’t mean to see you again, now the last tie between us, Aunt Drusilla, is dead!” Jude seized her hand and kissed it.
Let me help you, even if I do love you, and even if you…” “Don’t say it!—I know what you mean; but I can’t admit so much as that.
So few could enter into my feeling—they would say ’twas my fanciful fastidiousness, or something of that sort, and condemn me… It is none of the natural tragedies of love that’s love’s usual tragedy in civilized life, but a tragedy artificially manufactured for people who in a natural state would find relief in parting!
Jude, before I married him I had never thought out fully what marriage meant, even though I knew.
How I wish—I wish—” “You must go in now!” In a moment of impulse she bent over the sill, and laid her face upon his hair, weeping, and then imprinting a scarcely perceptible little kiss upon the top of his head, withdrawing quickly, so that he could not put his arms round her, as otherwise he unquestionably would have done.
They had stood parting in the silent highway, and their tense and passionate moods had led to bewildered inquiries of each other on how far their intimacy ought to go; till they had almost quarrelled, and she said tearfully that it was hardly proper of him as a parson in embryo to think of such a thing as kissing her even in farewell as he now wished to do.
Then she had conceded that the fact of the kiss would be nothing: all would depend upon the spirit of it.
If given in the spirit of a cousin and a friend she saw no objection: if in the spirit of a lover she could not permit it.
They had quickly run back, and met, and embracing most unpremeditatedly, kissed close and long.
When they parted for good it was with flushed cheeks on her side, and a beating heart on his.
The kiss was a turning-point in Jude’s career.
Back again in the cottage, and left to reflection, he saw one thing: that though his kiss of that aerial being had seemed the purest moment of his faultful life, as long as he nourished this unlicensed tenderness it was glaringly inconsistent for him to pursue the idea of becoming the soldier and servant of a religion in which sexual love was regarded as at its best a frailty, and at its worst damnation.
When to defend his affection tooth and nail, to persist with headlong force in impassioned attentions to her, was all he thought of, he was condemned _ipso facto_ as a professor of the accepted school of morals.
Yet with a wife living away from him with another husband, and himself in love erratically, the loved one’s revolt against her state being possibly on his account, he had sunk to be barely respectable according to regulation views.
Meanwhile Sue, after parting from him earlier in the day, had gone along to the station, with tears in her eyes for having run back and let him kiss her.
Jude ought not to have pretended that he was not a lover, and made her give way to an impulse to act unconventionally, if not wrongly.
“It was burning, like a lover’s—oh, it was!
Had this been a case in the court of an omniscient judge, he might have entered on his notes the curious fact that Sue had placed the minor for the major indiscretion, and had not said a word about the kiss.
Why, that’s what you were doing when I married you.
What then was the meaning of marrying at all?” “You wouldn’t like me any the better for telling you.” “I don’t object to know.” “Because I thought I could do nothing else.
If that had not entered into the case it would have been better to have hurt your feelings once for all then, than to marry you and hurt them all my life after… And you were so generous in never giving credit for a moment to the rumour.” “I am bound in honesty to tell you that I weighed its probability and inquired of your cousin about it.” “Ah!” she said with pained surprise.
But I didn’t reflect it would be—that it would be so much more than that… For a man and woman to live on intimate terms when one feels as I do is adultery, in any circumstances, however legal.
And you vowed to love me.” “Yes—that’s it!
It is as culpable to bind yourself to love always as to believe a creed always, and as silly as to vow always to like a particular food or drink!” “And do you mean, by living away from me, living by yourself?” “Well, if you insisted, yes.
Do you mind my saying that I have guessed what never once occurred to me before our marriage—that you were in love, and are in love, with Jude Fawley!” “You may go on guessing that I am, since you have begun.
But I cannot agree to such a preposterous notion as your going to live with your lover.
One line from her: Thank you from my heart, Richard.
“Why you haven’t been here—let me see—since you were married?
You don’t mean—anything wrong between you and Mrs. Phillotson?” “I do… My wretched state is that I’ve a wife I love who not only does not love me, but—but— Well, I won’t say.
And with her lover?” “Whom with is her matter.
I, like other men, profess to hold that if a husband gets such a so-called preposterous request from his wife, the only course that can possibly be regarded as right and proper and honourable in him is to refuse it, and put her virtuously under lock and key, and murder her lover perhaps.
It is not the same thing at all as the treachery of living on with a husband and playing him false… However, she has not distinctly implied living with him as wife, though I think she means to... And, to the best of my understanding, it is not an ignoble, merely animal, feeling between the two: that is the worst of it; because it makes me think their affection will be enduring.
I did not mean to confess to you that in the first jealous weeks of my marriage, before I had come to my right mind, I hid myself in the school one evening when they were together there, and I heard what they said.
I have a sort of affection for a little of it that belonged to my poor mother and father.
I won’t be so affected as to say I love you, because you know I don’t, except as a friend.
Phillotson saw her things put on the top, handed her in, and was obliged to make an appearance of kissing her as he wished her good-bye, which she quite understood and imitated.
She is, as I understand, gone to join her lover.
Altogether he looked a very handsome young fellow, his ardent affection for her burning in his eyes.
“And I am ashamed of myself for hating him because he married you.” “According to the rule of women’s whims I suppose I ought to suddenly love him, because he has let me go so generously and unexpectedly,” she answered smiling.
“But I am so cold, or devoid of gratitude, or so something, that even this generosity hasn’t made me love him, or repent, or want to stay with him as his wife; although I do feel I like his large-mindedness, and respect him more than ever.” “It may not work so well for us as if he had been less kind, and you had run away against his will,” murmured Jude.
Then he suddenly kissed her; and was going to kiss her again.
She wants to honestly and legally marry that man she has already married virtually; and begs me to enable her to do it.” “What have you done?” “I have agreed.
I thought at first I couldn’t do it without getting her into trouble about that second marriage, and I don’t want to injure her in any way.
“But perhaps it is that you don’t love me—not that you have become conventional!
Much as, under your teaching, I hate convention, I hope it _is_ that, not the other terrible alternative!” Even at this obvious moment for candour Sue could not be quite candid as to the state of that mystery, her heart.
I know you love her.
But even love may be cruel at times.
I never was so near being in love with him as when he made such thoughtful arrangements for my being comfortable on my journey, and offering to provide money.
If I loved him ever so little as a wife, I’d go back to him even now.” “But you don’t, do you?” “It is true—oh so terribly true!—I don’t.” “Nor me neither, I half-fear!” he said pettishly.
Say that you do a quarter, a tenth, as much as I do you, and I’ll be content!” “I’ve let you kiss me, and that tells enough.” “Just once or so!” “Well—don’t be a greedy boy.” He leant back, and did not look at her for a long time.
“You did kiss me just now, you know; and I didn’t dislike you to, I own it, Jude.
I have sometimes thought, since your marrying Phillotson because of a stupid scandal, that under the affectation of independent views you are as enslaved to the social code as any woman I know!” “Not mentally.
I didn’t marry him altogether because of the scandal.
But sometimes a woman’s _love of being loved_ gets the better of her conscience, and though she is agonized at the thought of treating a man cruelly, she encourages him to love her while she doesn’t love him at all.
Then, when she sees him suffering, her remorse sets in, and she does what she can to repair the wrong.” “You simply mean that you flirted outrageously with him, poor old chap, and then repented, and to make reparation, married him, though you tortured yourself to death by doing it.” “Well—if you will put it brutally!—it was a little like that—that and the scandal together—and your concealing from me what you ought to have told me before!” He could see that she was distressed and tearful at his criticisms, and soothed her, saying: “There, dear; don’t mind!
“I think, ma’am, I remember your relation, or friend, or whatever he is, coming here once before—late, just like this, with his wife—a lady, at any rate, that wasn’t you by no manner of means—jest as med be with you now.” “Oh do you?” said Sue, with a certain sickness of heart.
But he did a little; and began to love her none the less.
She has married another man—really married him!
And you shall kiss me just once there—not very long.” She put the tip of her finger gingerly to her cheek; and he did as commanded.
“You’ll excuse my asking, Phillotson, since everybody is talking of it: is this true as to your domestic affairs—that your wife’s going away was on no visit, but a secret elopement with a lover?
“She asked leave to go away with her lover, and I let her.
“Why should she?” “She doesn’t know you are ill.” “So much the better for both of us.” “Where are her lover and she living?” “At Melchester—I suppose; at least he was living there some time ago.” When Gillingham reached home he sat and reflected, and at last wrote an anonymous line to Sue, on the bare chance of its reaching her, the letter being enclosed in an envelope addressed to Jude at the diocesan capital.
“But I heard you were ill—very ill; and—and as I know that you recognize other feelings between man and woman than physical love, I have come.” “I am not very ill, my dear friend.
She wrote and told him it would be a kindness to her, since then she could marry and live respectably.
The dread of a reactionary change in the schoolmaster’s sentiments, coupled, perhaps, with a faint shamefacedness at letting even him know what a slipshod lack of thoroughness, from a man’s point of view, characterized her transferred allegiance, prevented her telling him of her, thus far, incomplete relations with Jude; and Phillotson lay writhing like a man in hell as he pictured the prettily dressed, maddening compound of sympathy and averseness who bore his name, returning impatiently to the home of her lover.
For then they’ll be able to marry, as they ought to have done at first.” Gillingham did not hurry to reply.
“Well; and what is it about?” he said after kissing her.
“Now then, Sue, at any rate, you can do what you like!” He looked at his sweetheart curiously.
“Are we—you and I—just as free now as if we had never married at all?” “Just as free—except, I believe, that a clergyman may object personally to remarry you, and hand the job on to somebody else.” “But I wonder—do you think it is really so with us?
Though not in their sense.” “One thing is certain, that however the decree may be brought about, a marriage is dissolved when it is dissolved.
I was afraid her criminal second marriage would have been discovered, and she punished; but nobody took any interest in her—nobody inquired, nobody suspected it.
If we’d been patented nobilities we should have had infinite trouble, and days and weeks would have been spent in investigations.” By degrees Sue acquired her lover’s cheerfulness at the sense of freedom, and proposed that they should take a walk in the fields, even if they had to put up with a cold dinner on account of it.
“Well, my dearest, the result of all this is that we can marry after a decent interval.” “Yes; I suppose we can,” said Sue, without enthusiasm.
I do love you, as you know, Sue.” “I know it abundantly.
But we two—” “Should be two dissatisfied ones linked together, which would be twice as bad as before… I think I should begin to be afraid of you, Jude, the moment you had contracted to cherish me under a Government stamp, and I was licensed to be loved on the premises by you—Ugh, how horrible and sordid!
“Apart from ourselves, and our unhappy peculiarities, it is foreign to a man’s nature to go on loving a person when he is told that he must and shall be that person’s lover.
There would be a much likelier chance of his doing it if he were told not to love.
If the marriage ceremony consisted in an oath and signed contract between the parties to cease loving from that day forward, in consideration of personal possession being given, and to avoid each other’s society as much as possible in public, there would be more loving couples than there are now.
People go on marrying because they can’t resist natural forces, although many of them may know perfectly well that they are possibly buying a month’s pleasure with a life’s discomfort.
But then they went and married just the same, because they had ordinary passions.
Fewer women like marriage than you suppose, only they enter into it for the dignity it is assumed to confer, and the social advantages it gains them sometimes—a dignity and an advantage that I am quite willing to do without.” Jude fell back upon his old complaint—that, intimate as they were, he had never once had from her an honest, candid declaration that she loved or could love him.
But the highest form of affection is based on full sincerity on both sides.
Not being men, these women don’t know that in looking back on those he has had tender relations with, a man’s heart returns closest to her who was the soul of truth in her conduct.
People who are good don’t want scolding as I do… But now that I have nobody but you, and nobody to defend me, it is very hard that I mustn’t have my own way in deciding how I’ll live with you, and whether I’ll be married or no!” “Sue, my own comrade and sweetheart, I don’t want to force you either to marry or to do the other thing—of course I don’t!
Now we won’t say any more about it, and go on just the same as we have done; and during the rest of our walk we’ll talk of the meadows only, and the floods, and the prospect of the farmers this coming year.” After this the subject of marriage was not mentioned by them for several days, though living as they were with only a landing between them it was constantly in their minds.
Well, waiving that, as she is nothing to me, and virtuously married to another man, why should she come troubling us?” “Are you sure she’s married?
“But aren’t you married?” he said.
God knows I love her little enough now, but I don’t want to be cruel to her.” He turned to the stairs.
I do love you, Sue, though I have danced attendance on you so long for such poor returns!
All that’s best and noblest in me loves you, and your freedom from everything that’s gross has elevated me, and enabled me to do what I should never have dreamt myself capable of, or any man, a year or two ago.
I must go out and speak to her, Sue, at least!” “I can’t say any more!—Oh, if you must, you must!” she said, bursting out into sobs that seemed to tear her heart.
And I didn’t want to marry again, either!
I do love you.
I give in!” “And I’ll arrange for our marriage to-morrow, or as soon as ever you wish.” “Yes, Jude.” “Then I’ll let her go,” said he, embracing Sue softly.
There; and there; and there!” He kissed her on one side, and on the other, and in the middle, and rebolted the front door.
You’ll come with me?” Sue agreed, and went off under cloak and umbrella letting Jude kiss her freely, and returning his kisses in a way she had never done before.
She may have seemed handsome enough in profile under the lamps, but a frowsiness was apparent this morning; and the sight of her own fresh charms in the looking-glass made Sue’s manner bright, till she reflected what a meanly sexual emotion this was in her, and hated herself for it.
My man finds he can’t do without me after all, and agrees to stand by the promise to marry again over here that he has made me all along.
I shall marry my man over again, now he’s willing, as there was a little flaw in the first ceremony.
You’ll find it an awful bother later on if you don’t.” “I have told you he is asking me to marry him—to make our natural marriage a legal one,” said Sue, with yet more dignity.
I didn’t want to write it, but never mind—I will.” III When Sue reached home Jude was awaiting her at the door to take the initial step towards their marriage.
What Arabella has been saying to me has made me feel more than ever how hopelessly vulgar an institution legal marriage is—a sort of trap to catch a man—I can’t bear to think of it.
Sue stood back, while her lover went up to the door.
Don’t you think it is destructive to a passion whose essence is its gratuitousness?” “Upon my word, love, you are beginning to frighten me, too, with all this foreboding!

</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The paper was one that circulated in South London only, and the marked advertisement was simply the announcement of a marriage at St. John’s Church, Waterloo Road, under the names, “CARTLETT——DONN”; the united pair being Arabella and the inn-keeper.
DEAR JUDE (I won’t be so distant as to call you Mr. Fawley),—I send to-day a newspaper, from which useful document you will learn that I was married over again to Cartlett last Tuesday.
The fact is, Jude, that, though I have never informed you before, there was a boy born of our marriage, eight months after I left you, when I was at Sydney, living with my father and mother.
Whatever I may have done before or afterwards, I was honest to you from the time we were married till I went away, and I remain, yours, &amp;c., ARABELLA CARTLETT.
That excessive regard of parents for their own children, and their dislike of other people’s, is, like class-feeling, patriotism, save-your-own-soul-ism, and other virtues, a mean exclusiveness at bottom.” Sue jumped up and kissed Jude with passionate devotion.
I wonder when he’ll arrive?” “In the course of a few weeks, I suppose.” “I wish—When shall we have courage to marry, Jude?” “Whenever you have it, I think I shall.
Sue thereupon could not refrain from instantly doing likewise, being a harp which the least wind of emotion from another’s heart could make to vibrate as readily as a radical stir in her own.
“There’s more for us to think about in that one little hungry heart than in all the stars of the sky… I suppose, dear, we must pluck up courage, and get that ceremony over?
Oh Jude, you’ll love me dearly, won’t you, afterwards?
I do want to be kind to this child, and to be a mother to him; and our adding the legal form to our marriage might make it easier for me.” IV Their next and second attempt thereat was more deliberately made, though it was begun on the morning following the singular child’s arrival at their home.
Their position lent them shyness, and having an impression that a marriage at a superintendent registrar’s office was more private than an ecclesiastical one, they decided to avoid a church this time.
As she read the four-square undertaking, never before seen by her, into which her own and Jude’s names were inserted, and by which that very volatile essence, their love for each other, was supposed to be made permanent, her face seemed to grow painfully apprehensive.
Coming after her previous experience of matrimony, all the romance of their attachment seemed to be starved away by placing her present case in the same category.
“Well, I bain’t set against marrying as your great-aunt was,” said the widow.
But it medn’t be true that he belonged to ye more than to me.” A small slow voice rose from the shade of the fireside, as if out of the earth: “If I was you, Mother, I wouldn’t marry Father!” It came from little Time, and they started, for they had forgotten him.
“Jude, I want you to kiss me, as a lover, incorporeally,” she said, tremulously nestling up to him, with damp lashes.
And it seems awful temerity in us two to go marrying!
Within the office several persons were gathered, and our couple perceived that a marriage between a soldier and a young woman was just in progress.
Sue, Jude, and the widow stood in the background while this was going on, Sue reading the notices of marriage on the wall.
The latter drew back and turned to her lover, her mouth shaping itself like that of a child about to give way to grief: “Jude—I don’t like it here!
The place gives me the horrors: it seems so unnatural as the climax of our love!
“No—we need not marry here or anywhere, unless we like, even now,” he said.
“We can be married in a church, if not with the same certificate with another he’ll give us, I think.
How good you are, my friend: you give way to all my whims!” “They accord very much with my own.” He gave her a little kiss behind a pillar while the attention of everybody present was taken up in observing the bridal procession entering the vestry; and then they came outside the building.
“Well,” cried their guest when they entered, “I said to myself when I zeed ye coming so loving up to the door, ‘They made up their minds at last, then!’” They briefly hinted that they had not.
Chok’ it all, that I should have lived to see a good old saying like ‘marry in haste and repent at leisure’ spoiled like this by you two!
Why when I and my poor man were married we thought no more o’t than of a game o’ dibs!” “Don’t tell the child when he comes in,” whispered Sue nervously.
“They haven’t been married long enough for it to be theirs!” But although the smouldering maternal instinct was strong enough in her to lead her to quash her husband’s conjecture, she was not disposed on second thoughts to be more candid than necessary.
She looks quite a girl.” “They are only lovers, or lately married, and have the child in charge, as anybody can see.” All continued to move ahead.
“Oh no—I fancy they are not married, or they wouldn’t be so much to one another as that… I wonder!” “But I thought you said he did marry her?” “I heard he was going to—that’s all, going to make another attempt, after putting it off once or twice… As far as they themselves are concerned they are the only two in the show.
I should never have noticed their being in love, if you hadn’t said so.” “You never see anything,” she rejoined.
Nevertheless Cartlett’s view of the lovers’ or married pair’s conduct was undoubtedly that of the general crowd, whose attention seemed to be in no way attracted by what Arabella’s sharpened vision discerned.
She’s not a particular warm-hearted creature to my thinking, though she cares for him pretty middling much—as much as she’s able to; and he could make her heart ache a bit if he liked to try—which he’s too simple to do.
“I am soon going to be married, but my intended couldn’t come up here to-day.
Has he married again?” “I don’t know.” “She’s pretty, isn’t she!” “Yes—nothing to complain of; or jump at.
As for that body with him—she don’t know what love is—at least what I call love!
She adored roses, and what Arabella had witnessed was Sue detaining Jude almost against his will while she learnt the names of this variety and that, and put her face within an inch of their blooms to smell them.
The curious facts of a child coming to them unexpectedly, who called Jude “Father,” and Sue “Mother,” and a hitch in a marriage ceremony intended for quietness to be performed at a registrar’s office, together with rumours of the undefended cases in the law-courts, bore only one translation to plain minds.
When they came back they let it be understood indirectly, and with total indifference and weariness of mien, that they were legally married at last.
And he loves me so.
Then she ought to be, or somebody’s—that’s very clear!” “They’ve only been married a very few weeks, whether or no.” “A strange pair to be painting the Two Tables!
“But do you see they don’t think we are married?
Noting her dissembled distress Jude kissed her, and said it was time to go and see if the lodgings were ready.
Later still he was at Kennetbridge, a thriving town not more than a dozen miles south of Marygreen, this being his nearest approach to the village where he was known; for he had a sensitive dread of being questioned as to his life and fortunes by those who had been acquainted with him during his ardent young manhood of study and promise, and his brief and unhappy married life at that time.
I begin to feel quite a sinking.” “With all my heart,” said the other.
But my wicked heart will ramble off in spite of myself!” “Well—I know what it is to have a wanton mind o’ my own, too!
If you on’y knew what I do dream sometimes o’ nights quite against my wishes, you’d say I had my struggles!” (Anny, too, had grown rather serious of late, her lover having jilted her.)
When they got yet farther on, and were passing the lonely house in which Arabella and Jude had lived during the first months of their marriage, and where the pig-killing had taken place, she could control herself no longer.
You know, I suppose, who I married?” “No.” “Jude Fawley—also a scholar of yours—at least a night scholar—for some little time, I think?
And he—I understood—” “Divorced her—as you did yours—perhaps for better reasons.” “Indeed?” “Well—he med have been right in doing it—right for both; for I soon married again, and all went pretty straight till my husband died lately.
Sue kissed the children, and said, “How is he now?” “Still better!” returned Mrs. Edlin cheerfully.
“I thought I had better tell you?” she continued, kissing him anxiously.
I love the place—although I know how it hates all men like me—the so-called self-taught—how it scorns our laboured acquisitions, when it should be the first to respect them; how it sneers at our false quantities and mispronunciations, when it should say, I see you want help, my poor friend!
And pushing his way to the front he took up a position close to the barrier, still hugging the youngest child in his arms, while Sue and the others kept immediately behind him.
He’s married, I suppose, then, and that’s his child he’s carrying.
I doubt if I have anything more for my present rule of life than following inclinations which do me and nobody else any harm, and actually give pleasure to those I love best.
How good of you to wait in the rain all this time—to gratify my infatuation!
Sue had not the art of prevarication, and, after admitting several facts as to their late difficulties and wanderings, she was startled by the landlady saying suddenly: “Are you really a married woman?” Sue hesitated; and then impulsively told the woman that her husband and herself had each been unhappy in their first marriages, after which, terrified at the thought of a second irrevocable union, and lest the conditions of the contract should kill their love, yet wishing to be together, they had literally not found the courage to repeat it, though they had attempted it two or three times.
Therefore, though in her own sense of the words she was a married woman, in the landlady’s sense she was not.
She thought of the strange operation of a simple-minded man’s ruling passion, that it should have led Jude, who loved her and the children so tenderly, to place them here in this depressing purlieu, because he was still haunted by his dream.
It’s the anthem from the seventy-third Psalm; ‘Truly God is loving unto Israel.’” She sobbed again.
“There is something external to us which says, ‘You shan’t!’ First it said, ‘You shan’t learn!’ Then it said, ‘You shan’t labour!’ Now it says, ‘You shan’t love!’” He tried to soothe her by saying, “That’s bitter of you, darling.” “But it’s true!” Thus they waited, and she went back again to her room.
We went about loving each other too much—indulging ourselves to utter selfishness with each other!
You are in work now; but remember, it may only be because our history and relations are not absolutely known… Possibly, if they knew our marriage had not been formalized they would turn you out of your job as they did at Aldbrickham!” “I hardly know.
I have not been conscious of it, or of any wrongdoing towards you, whom I love more than myself.
And now you seem to take such a much lower view!” “I want a humble heart; and a chastened mind; and I have never had them yet!” “You have been fearless, both as a thinker and as a feeler, and you deserved more admiration than I gave.
But is there anything better on earth than that we should love one another?” “Yes.
It depends on the sort of love; and yours—ours—is the wrong.” “I won’t have it, Sue!
Come, when do you wish our marriage to be signed in a vestry?” She paused, and looked up uneasily.
Why did you intrude here?” “How can you ask!” he retorted in quick reproach, for his full heart was wounded to its centre at this attitude of hers towards him.
I, who love you better than my own self—better—far better—than you have loved me!
I see marriage differently now.
“I love you as much as ever!
Only—I ought not to love you—any more.
Nature’s own marriage it is, unquestionably!” “But not Heaven’s.
You root out of me what little affection and reverence I had left in me for the Church as an old acquaintance… What I can’t understand in you is your extraordinary blindness now to your old logic.
How you argued that marriage was only a clumsy contract—which it is—how you showed all the objections to it—all the absurdities!
Don’t satirize me: it cuts like a knife!” He flung his arms round her and kissed her passionately there in the silent street, before she could hinder him.
Perhaps as we couldn’t conscientiously marry at first in the old-fashioned way, we ought to have parted.
I slipped into my false position through jealousy and agitation!” “But surely through love—you loved me?” “Yes.
But I wanted to let it stop there, and go on always as mere lovers; until—” “But people in love couldn’t live for ever like that!” “Women could: men can’t, because they—won’t.
You have never loved me as I love you—never—never!
Yours is not a passionate heart—your heart does not burn in a flame!
You are, upon the whole, a sort of fay, or sprite—not a woman!” “At first I did not love you, Jude; that I own.
When I first knew you I merely wanted you to love me.
I did not exactly flirt with you; but that inborn craving which undermines some women’s morals almost more than unbridled passion—the craving to attract and captivate, regardless of the injury it may do the man—was in me; and when I found I had caught you, I was frightened.
And then—I don’t know how it was—I couldn’t bear to let you go—possibly to Arabella again—and so I got to love you, Jude.
But you see, however fondly it ended, it began in the selfish and cruel wish to make your heart ache for me without letting mine ache for you.” “And now you add to your cruelty by leaving me!” “Ah—yes!
Perhaps—perhaps I spoilt one of the highest and purest loves that ever existed between man and woman!
“Oh but you shall kiss me!” said she, starting up.
“I can’t—bear—!” He clasped her, and kissed her weeping face as he had scarcely ever done before, and they remained in silence till she said, “Good-bye, good-bye!” And then gently pressing him away she got free, trying to mitigate the sadness by saying: “We’ll be dear friends just the same, Jude, won’t we?

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>She has never really married him although they have passed as man and wife so long.
He wished for her still, in his curious way, if he did not love her, and, apart from policy, soon felt that he would be gratified to have her again as his, always provided that she came willingly.
I can see her views on the indissolubility of marriage well enough, and I know where she got them.
He would not conceal from her that passionate love had little to do with his communication.
It was necessary to act under an acquired and cultivated sense of the same, if you wished to enjoy an average share of comfort and honour; and to let crude loving kindness take care of itself.
How can you go—” “He is going to marry me again.
I have always regretted that feint of ours in going away and pretending to come back legally married, to save appearances.
I loved you, and you loved me; and we closed with each other; and that made the marriage.
Therefore our marriage is not cancelled.” “Yes; I know how you see it,” she answered with despairing self-suppression.
“But I am going to marry him again, as it would be called by you.
But how if you and I had married legally, as we were on the point of doing?” “I should have felt just the same—that ours was not a marriage.
Do you love him?
It will be a fanatic prostitution—God forgive me, yes—that’s what it will be!” “I don’t love him—I must, must, own it, in deepest remorse!
But I shall try to learn to love him by obeying him.” Jude argued, urged, implored; but her conviction was proof against all.
I have even owned the extreme fact that I do not love him.
What—isn’t he coming to fetch you—to marry you from here?
We are to be married at his little church at Marygreen.” She was so sadly sweet in what he called her wrong-headedness that Jude could not help being moved to tears more than once for pity of her.
The devoted fail… ‘Charity seeketh not her own.’” “In that chapter we are at one, ever beloved darling, and on it we’ll part friends.
Jude had no heart to go to his work that day.
She started at the endearment, though it had been spoken advisedly without fervour.
He bent and kissed her cheek.
Phillotson’s heart sank, for desire was renascent in him.
“When are we going to have the marriage?
“It do make my heart ache to see such pretty open-work as that a-burned by the flames—not that ornamental night-rails can be much use to a’ ould ’ooman like I.
“I’ll tell ’ee what—you ought not to marry this man again!” said Mrs. Edlin indignantly.
“You are in love wi’ t’ other still!” “Yes I must—I am his already!” “Pshoo!
So I may get back in some degree into my old track.” “Well—if you’ve got any sound reason for marrying her again, do it now in God’s name!
She’s had three children by him, and he loves her dearly; and it’s a wicked shame to egg her on to this, poor little quivering thing!
But he checked his impulse to kiss her, remembering her start of yesterday, which unpleasantly lingered in his mind.
And thus his suspense as to Sue’s welfare, and the possible marriage, moved him to dispatch for intelligence the last emissary he would have thought of choosing deliberately.
She wanted to marry him again, didn’t she?
Among the possible consequences of her marriage Sue had not dwelt on this.
I think I shall get married and settled again.
The entrance of Taylor infused fresh spirit into the company, and they remained sitting, till Arabella whispered to her father: “Now we may as well go.” “But the parson don’t know?” “Yes, I told him last night that we might come between eight and nine, as there were reasons of decency for doing it as early and quiet as possible; on account of it being our second marriage, which might make people curious to look on if they knew.
“You’ve promised to marry me several times as we’ve sat here to-night.
“You and my daughter have been living here together these three or four days, quite on the understanding that you were going to marry her.
“I’d marry the W–––– of Babylon rather than do anything dishonourable!
“If I am bound in honour to marry her—as I suppose I am—though how I came to be here with her I know no more than a dead man—marry her I will, so help me God!
“But it do seem a rare curiosity for a couple to marry over again!
She said I ought to marry you again, and I have straightway.
“I’ve got a bargain for my trouble in marrying thee over again!” Arabella was saying to him.
“I have been thinking of my foolish feeling about the pig you and I killed during our first marriage.
The landlord of the lodging, who had heard that they were a queer couple, had doubted if they were married at all, especially as he had seen Arabella kiss Jude one evening when she had taken a little cordial; and he was about to give them notice to quit, till by chance overhearing her one night haranguing Jude in rattling terms, and ultimately flinging a shoe at his head, he recognized the note of genuine wedlock; and concluding that they must be respectable, said no more.
You know I love Sue.
I don’t wish to mince the matter—there stands the fact: I love her.
If she retains any of her old nature at all, she’ll come.” “You’ve no respect for marriage whatever, or its rights and duties!” “What _does_ it matter what my opinions are—a wretch like me!
Sue, Sue, you are not worth a man’s love!” Her bosom began to go up and down.
Kiss me, oh kiss me lots of times, and say I am not a coward and a contemptible humbug—I can’t bear it!” She rushed up to him and, with her mouth on his, continued: “I must tell you—oh I must—my darling Love!
It has been—only a church marriage—an apparent marriage I mean!
He suggested it at the very first!” “How?” “I mean it is a nominal marriage only.
Pressing her to him in his arms, he bruised her lips with kisses.
You do love me still?” “I do!
I mustn’t kiss you back as I would!” “But do!” “And yet you are so dear!—and you look so ill—” “And so do you!
“But there, there, darling; I give you back your kisses; I do, I do!
As he passed the end of the church she heard his coughs mingling with the rain on the windows, and in a last instinct of human affection, even now unsubdued by her fetters, she sprang up as if to go and succour him.
“Lord love ’ee, what do ye do that yourself for, when I’ve come o’ purpose!
And I want to eradicate it… Well—I will tell you this—Jude has been here this afternoon, and I find I still love him—oh, grossly!
And—” “Well?” “I kissed him, and let him kiss me.” “Oh—the old story!” “Richard, I didn’t know we were going to kiss each other till we did!” “How many times?” “A good many.
With a lover hanging about, a half-marriage should be completed.
It is my duty!” Placing the candlestick on the chest of drawers he led her through the doorway, and lifting her bodily, kissed her.
Fifty-five years ago, come Fall, since my man and I married!
“I’m hanged if you haven’t been clever in this last stroke!” she would say, “to get a nurse for nothing by marrying me!” Jude was absolutely indifferent to what she said, and indeed, often regarded her abuse in a humorous light.
“Calling a respectable married woman by the name of that—” She remembered herself and he did not catch the word.
She, so sensitive, so shrinking, that the very wind seemed to blow on her with a touch of deference… As for Sue and me when we were at our own best, long ago—when our minds were clear, and our love of truth fearless—the time was not ripe for us!
But you must be prepared for the consequences.” Putting his arm round her shoulders he kissed her there and then.
The attraction which moved Arabella to go abroad had evidently drawn away the other inmates long before.
Almost as soon as they had arrived the grand procession of boats began; the oars smacking with a loud kiss on the face of the stream, as they were lowered from the perpendicular.
“Shame on ’ee to wreck a heart so!” “I shan’t talk of love to-day.” “Why not?
An arch expression overspread Arabella’s face at the feel of the arm, but she kept her eyes on the river as if she did not know of the embrace.
“What a fidget you are, my love,” said the physician, who, being pressed close against her by the throng, had no need of personal effort for contact.
She swore not to see him again.” “How is she looking?” “Tired and miserable, poor heart.

an_international_episode

This animated discussion was checked by their arrival at the hotel, which had been recommended to them by an American gentleman whose acquaintance they made--with whom, indeed, they became very intimate--on the steamer, and who had proposed to accompany them to the inn and introduce them, in a friendly way, to the proprietor.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;My dear boy, I hope you won&#39;t begin to flirt,&quot; said Percy Beaumont.
&quot;With a married woman, if she&#39;s bent upon it, it&#39;s all very well,&quot; Beaumont expounded.
The fan was also adorned with pink love knots; but Percy Beaumont declined it, although he was very hot.
Two or three other persons came in, and there was a shifting of seats and changing of places; the gentlemen all entered into intimate conversation with the two Englishmen, made them urgent offers of hospitality, and hoped they might frequently be of service to them.
She is not in the least a flirt; that isn&#39;t at all her line; she doesn&#39;t know the alphabet of that sort of thing.
She has lived a great deal in Boston, with another sister of mine--the eldest of us--who married a Bostonian.
Many of them still linger in the minds of our travelers, attended by a train of harmonious images--images of brilliant mornings on lawns and piazzas that overlooked the sea; of innumerable pretty girls; of infinite lounging and talking and laughing and flirting and lunching and dining; of universal friendliness and frankness; of occasions on which they knew everyone and everything and had an extraordinary sense of ease; of drives and rides in the late afternoon over gleaming beaches, on long sea roads, beneath a sky lighted up by marvelous sunsets; of suppers, on the return, informal, irregular, agreeable; of evenings at open windows or on the perpetual verandas, in the summer starlight, above the warm Atlantic.
The young Englishmen were introduced to everybody, entertained by everybody, intimate with everybody.
&quot;One of them is married.
Her sister continued to look at her; then, at last, &quot;Are you in love with Lord Lambeth?&quot;
&quot;You ARE in love with him then?&quot;
&quot;If I were in love with Lord Lambeth, as you said just now, it would be bad policy on your part to abuse him.&quot;
You are not in love with Lord Lambeth: I believe it, perfectly.
They all descended from their vehicle and entered the famous inclosure; and they secured the services of a venerable beefeater, who, though there were many other claimants for legendary information, made a fine exclusive party of them and marched them through courts and corridors, through armories and prisons.
Mrs. Westgate, following the fashion of many of her compatriots, caused herself and her sister to be presented at the English court by her diplomatic representative--for it was in this manner that she alluded to the American minister to England, inquiring what on earth he was put there for, if not to make the proper arrangements for one&#39;s going to a Drawing Room.
She was not in love with Lord Lambeth--she assured herself of that.
It had been a part of this charm from the first that he felt that she judged him and measured him more freely and irresponsibly--more at her ease and her leisure, as it were--than several young ladies with whom he had been on the whole about as intimate.
Lord Lambeth responded to this intimation by scornful laughter, and his companion continued, after a pause: &quot;I said just now I didn&#39;t want to know anything about the affair; but I will confess that I am curious to learn whether you propose to marry Miss Bessie Alden.&quot;
&quot;You do really propose to marry the little sister, then?&quot;
She is the only girl I have ever seen that was not dying to marry me.&quot;
Depend upon it that she is dying to marry you just as much and just as little as all the rest of them.&quot;
&quot;Come; you would not marry him?&quot;

They urged, therefore, that, without direct allusion to the manners of the Eastern tribes, and to the romantic conflicts of the period, the title of a &quot;Tale of the Crusaders&quot; would resemble the playbill, which is said to have announced the tragedy of Hamlet, the character of the Prince of Denmark being left out.
The love of travelling had pervaded all ranks, and carried the subjects of Britain into all quarters of the world.
One of the inferior characters introduced was a supposed relation of Richard Coeur de Lion--a violation of the truth of history which gave offence to Mr. Mills, the author of the &quot;History of Chivalry and the Crusades,&quot; who was not, it may be presumed, aware that romantic fiction naturally includes the power of such invention, which is indeed one of the requisites of the art.
Prince David of Scotland, who was actually in the host, and was the hero of some very romantic adventures on his way home, was also pressed into my service, and constitutes one of my DRAMATIS PERSONAE.
It is true I had already brought upon the field him of the lion heart.
The most curious register of the history of King Richard is an ancient romance, translated originally from the Norman; and at first certainly having a pretence to be termed a work of chivalry, but latterly becoming stuffed with the most astonishing and monstrous fables.
There is perhaps no metrical romance upon record where, along with curious and genuine history, are mingled more absurd and exaggerated incidents.
We have placed in the Appendix to this Introduction the passage of the romance in which Richard figures as an ogre, or literal cannibal.
He was one of the chief of that band of Scottish chivalry who accompanied James, the Good Lord Douglas, on his expedition to the Holy Land with the heart of King Robert Bruce.
That Conrade, however, was reckoned the enemy of Richard is agreed both in history and romance.
Richard, according to the romance which bears his name, &quot;could no longer repress his fury.
But for my love I you bid, To meat with me that ye dwell; And afterward I shall you tell.
The king took his seat attended by the principal officers of his court, at the high table, and the rest of the company were marshalled at a long table below him.
His disposition seemed, in some degree, to partake of the qualities of his bodily frame; and as the one possessed great strength and endurance, united with the power of violent exertion, the other, under a calm and undisturbed semblance, had much of the fiery and enthusiastic love of glory which constituted the principal attribute of the renowned Norman line, and had rendered them sovereigns in every corner of Europe where they had drawn their adventurous swords.
&quot;By Mohammed, Prophet of God, and by Allah, God of the Prophet,&quot; replied his late foeman, &quot;there is not treachery in my heart towards thee.
&quot;You are,&quot; he said, &quot;of a nation that loves to laugh, and you make sport with yourselves, and with others, by telling what is impossible, and reporting what never chanced.
This French word signified a sort of sport much used among the French chivalry, which consisted in vying with each other in making the most romantic gasconades.
The juice of the grape is given to him that will use it wisely, as that which cheers the heart of man after toil, refreshes him in sickness, and comforts him in sorrow.
Seest thou not, O thou more blind than any who asks alms at the door of the Mosque, that the liberty thou dost boast of is restrained even in that which is dearest to man&#39;s happiness and to his household; and that thy law, if thou dost practise it, binds thee in marriage to one single mate, be she sick or healthy, be she fruitful or barren, bring she comfort and joy, or clamour and strife, to thy table and to thy bed?
&quot;Saracen,&quot; replied the Christian warrior, &quot;the love which a true knight binds on one only, fair and faithful, is the gem entire; the affection thou flingest among thy enslaved wives and half-wedded slaves is worthless, comparatively, as the sparkling shivers of the broken diamond.&quot;
&quot;Now, by the Holy Caaba,&quot; said the Emir, &quot;thou art a madman who hugs his chain of iron as if it were of gold!
&quot;Saracen,&quot; replied the Crusader, &quot;thou speakest like one who never saw a woman worthy the affection of a soldier.
The beauty of our fair ones gives point to our spears and edge to our swords; their words are our law; and as soon will a lamp shed lustre when unkindled, as a knight distinguish himself by feats of arms, having no mistress of his affection.&quot;
The Saracen bent his head to the dust as he recognized the seal and handwriting of the renowned Soldan of Egypt and Syria; and having kissed the paper with profound respect, he pressed it to his forehead, then returned it to the Christian, saying, &quot;Rash Frank, thou hast sinned against thine own blood and mine, for not showing this to me when we met.&quot;
As the Caliph, companion of the Prophet, hath told us, so have we done, and those whom our justice has smitten are but the priests of Satan.
But unto the good men who, without stirring up nation against nation, worship sincerely in the faith of Issa Ben Mariam, we are a shadow and a shield; and such being he whom you seek, even though the light of the Prophet hath not reached him, from me he will only have love, favour, and regard.&quot;
Each also seemed to possess, as far as the difference betwixt the animal and rational species admitted, the confidence and affection of the horse which was the constant companion of his travels and his warfare.
The ardour of noon was now past, and a light breeze somewhat alleviated the terrors of the desert, though not without bearing on its wings an impalpable dust, which the Saracen little heeded, though his heavily-armed companion felt it as such an annoyance that he hung his iron casque at his saddle-bow, and substituted the light riding-cap, termed in the language of the time a MORTIER, from its resemblance in shape to an ordinary mortar.
&quot;You must add free blood and a fearless heart,&quot; said the Christian; &quot;then, perhaps, you will not have spoken untruly of the dignity of knighthood.&quot;
&quot;God forbid,&quot; said the Knight of the Leopard, &quot;that the poorest knight in Christendom should not be free, in all honourable service, to devote his hand and sword, the fame of his actions, and the fixed devotion of his heart, to the fairest princess who ever wore coronet on her brow!&quot;
&quot;But a little while since,&quot; said the Saracen, &quot;and you described love as the highest treasure of the heart--thine hath undoubtedly been high and nobly bestowed?&quot;
It is enough for thee to know that, as thou sayest, my love is highly and nobly bestowed--most highly--most nobly; but if thou wouldst hear of love and broken lances, venture thyself, as thou sayest, to the camp of the Crusaders, and thou wilt find exercise for thine ears, and, if thou wilt, for thy hands too.&quot;
Sir Kenneth knew enough of the Eastern languages to be assured that he chanted sonnets of love, containing all the glowing praises of beauty in which the Oriental poets are so fond of luxuriating, and which, therefore, were peculiarly unfitted for a serious or devotional strain of thought, the feeling best becoming the Wilderness of the Temptation.
I took no offence when I saw you gorge hog&#39;s flesh and drink wine, and permitted you to enjoy a treat which you called your Christian liberty, only pitying in my heart your foul pastimes.
&quot;Friend Saracen,&quot; said the Christian, &quot;I blame not the love of minstrelsy and of the GAI SCIENCE; albeit, we yield unto it even too much room in our thoughts when they should be bent on better things.
But prayers and holy psalms are better fitting than LAIS of love, or of wine-cups, when men walk in this Valley of the Shadow of Death, full of fiends and demons, whom the prayers of holy men have driven forth from the haunts of humanity to wander amidst scenes as accursed as themselves.&quot;
Neither do I any longer wonder at your obstinacy in a false faith, since, doubtless, it is part of the fiendish disposition which hath descended from your ancestors, those infernal huntsmen, as you have described them, to love falsehood rather than truth; and I no longer marvel that your spirits become high and exalted, and vent themselves in verse and in tunes, when you approach to the places encumbered by the haunting of evil spirits, which must excite in you that joyous feeling which others experience when approaching the land of their human ancestry.&quot;
Speak, therefore, what thou wilt, secure of any resentment from me; but gather so much sense as to apprehend that if thou shalt again proffer me any violence, I will strike thy shagged head from thy meagre shoulders.--and to thee, friend Kenneth,&quot; he added, as he remounted his steed, &quot;I must needs say, that in a companion through the desert, I love friendly deeds better than fair words.
&quot;By my word, Saracen,&quot; said the Christian, &quot;if thou wilt have it in plain terms, I thought that strange figure was the devil; and being of thy lineage, I knew not what family secret you might be communicating to each other, as you lay lovingly rolling together on the sand.&quot;
Kenneth the Scot was uncertain how long his senses had been lost in profound repose, when he was roused to recollection by a sense of oppression on his chest, which at first suggested a flirting dream of struggling with a powerful opponent, and at length recalled him fully to his senses.
The Scottish knight assisted with profound sincerity at these acts of devotion, his opinion of his host beginning, in the meantime, to be so much changed, that he doubted whether, from the severity of his penance and the ardour of his prayers, he ought not to regard him as a saint; and when they arose from the ground, he stood with reverence before him, as a pupil before an honoured master.
Banish from thy innermost heart each profane and carnal thought, for to harbour such while in this place were a deadly impiety.&quot;
Yet, though Kenneth knew this to be the case, the solemnity of the place and hour, the surprise at the sudden appearance of these votaresses, and the visionary manner in which they moved past him, had such influence on his imagination that he could scarce conceive that the fair procession which he beheld was formed of creatures of this world, so much did they resemble a choir of supernatural beings, rendering homage to the universal object of adoration.
Her step, her face, her form were so completely assimilated to the rest of the choristers that it was impossible to perceive the least marks of individuality; and yet Kenneth&#39;s heart throbbed like a bird that would burst from its cage, as if to assure him, by its sympathetic suggestions, that the female who held the right file on the second rank of the novices was dearer to him, not only than all the rest that were present, but than the whole sex besides.
The romantic passion of love, as it was cherished, and indeed enjoined, by the rules of chivalry, associated well with the no less romantic feelings of devotion; and they might be said much more to enhance than to counteract each other.
It was, therefore, with a glow of expectation that had something even of a religious character that Sir Kenneth, his sensations thrilling from his heart to the ends of his fingers, expected some second sign of the presence of one who, he strongly fancied, had already bestowed on him the first.
It was the lady of his love!
To grope on the floor for the buds which she had dropped--to press them to his lips, to his bosom, now alternately, now together--to rivet his lips to the cold stones on which, as near as he could judge, she had so lately stepped--to play all the extravagances which strong affection suggests and vindicates to those who yield themselves up to it, were but the tokens of passionate love common to all ages.
But it was peculiar to the times of chivalry that, in his wildest rapture, the knight imagined of no attempt to follow or to trace the object of such romantic attachment; that he thought of her as of a deity, who, having deigned to show herself for an instant to her devoted worshipper, had again returned to the darkness of her sanctuary--or as an influential planet, which, having darted in some auspicious minute one favourable ray, wrapped itself again in its veil of mist.
The motions of the lady of his love were to him those of a superior being, who was to move without watch or control, rejoice him by her appearance, or depress him by her absence, animate him by her kindness, or drive him to despair by her cruelty--all at her own free will, and without other importunity or remonstrance than that expressed by the most devoted services of the heart and sword of the champion, whose sole object in life was to fulfil her commands, and, by the splendour of his own achievements, to exalt her fame.
Such were the rules of chivalry, and of the love which was its ruling principle.
But Sir Kenneth&#39;s attachment was rendered romantic by other and still more peculiar circumstances.
She moved in a circle which his rank of knighthood permitted him indeed to approach, but not to mingle with; and highly as he stood distinguished for warlike skill and enterprise, still the poor Scottish soldier was compelled to worship his divinity at a distance almost as great as divides the Persian from the sun which he adores.
But when was the pride of woman too lofty to overlook the passionate devotion of a lover, however inferior in degree?
If a knight&#39;s personal beauty was praised, even the most prudish dames of the military court of England would make an exception in favour of the Scottish Kenneth; and it oftentimes happened that, notwithstanding the very considerable largesses which princes and peers bestowed on the minstrels, an impartial spirit of independence would seize the poet, and the harp was swept to the heroism of one who had neither palfreys nor garments to bestow in guerdon of his applause.
The moments when she listened to the praises of her lover became gradually more and more dear to the high-born Edith, relieving the flattery with which her ear was weary, and presenting to her a subject of secret contemplation, more worthy, as he seemed by general report, than those who surpassed him in rank and in the gifts of fortune.
When Edith became aware of the state of her own sentiments, chivalrous as were her sentiments, becoming a maiden not distant from the throne of England--gratified as her pride must have been with the mute though unceasing homage rendered to her by the knight whom she had distinguished, there were moments when the feelings of the woman, loving and beloved, murmured against the restraints of state and form by which she was surrounded, and when she almost blamed the timidity of her lover, who seemed resolved not to infringe them.
The thought involuntarily pressed on her that she herself must venture, were it but the point of her fairy foot, beyond the prescribed boundary, if she ever hoped to give a lover so reserved and bashful an opportunity of so slight a favour as but to salute her shoe-tie.
There was an example--the noted precedent of the &quot;King&#39;s daughter of Hungary,&quot; who thus generously encouraged the &quot;squire of low degree;&quot; and Edith, though of kingly blood, was no king&#39;s daughter, any more than her lover was of low degree--fortune had put no such extreme barrier in obstacle to their affections.
Something, however, within the maiden&#39;s bosom--that modest pride which throws fetters even on love itself forbade her, notwithstanding the superiority of her condition, to make those advances, which, in every case, delicacy assigns to the other sex; above all, Sir Kenneth was a knight so gentle and honourable, so highly accomplished, as her imagination at least suggested, together with the strictest feelings of what was due to himself and to her, that however constrained her attitude might be while receiving his adorations, like the image of some deity, who is neither supposed to feel nor to reply to the homage of its votaries, still the idol feared that to step prematurely from her pedestal would be to degrade herself in the eyes of her devoted worshipper.
By what train of observation--by what secret signs, looks, or gestures--by what instinctive freemasonry of love, this degree of intelligence came to subsist between Edith and her lover, we cannot attempt to trace; for we are old, and such slight vestiges of affection, quickly discovered by younger eyes, defy the power of ours.
Enough that such affection did subsist between parties who had never even spoken to one another--though, on the side of Edith, it was checked by a deep sense of the difficulties and dangers which must necessarily attend the further progress of their attachment; and upon that of the knight by a thousand doubts and fears lest he had overestimated the slight tokens of the lady&#39;s notice, varied, as they necessarily were, by long intervals of apparent coldness, during which either the fear of exciting the observation of others, and thus drawing danger upon her lover, or that of sinking in his esteem by seeming too willing to be won, made her behave with indifference, and as if unobservant of his presence.
A Christian soldier, a devoted lover, could fear nothing, think of nothing, but his duty to Heaven and his devoir to his lady.
&quot;And I am Guenevra, his lady and his love,&quot; replied the female, in tones which, being shriller, were yet wilder than those of her companion.
The scene must change, as our programme has announced, from the mountain wilderness of Jordan to the camp of King Richard of England, then stationed betwixt Jean d&#39;Acre and Ascalon, and containing that army with which he of the lion heart had promised himself a triumphant march to Jerusalem, and in which he would probably have succeeded, if not hindered by the jealousies of the Christian princes engaged in the same enterprise, and the offence taken by them at the uncurbed haughtiness of the English monarch, and Richard&#39;s unveiled contempt for his brother sovereigns, who, his equals in rank, were yet far his inferiors in courage, hardihood, and military talents.
It is a cold palsy, a dead lethargy, a disease that deprives them of speech and action, a canker that has eaten into the heart of all that is noble, and chivalrous, and virtuous among them--that has made them false to the noblest vow ever knights were sworn to--has made them indifferent to their fame, and forgetful of their God!&quot;
&quot;For the love of Heaven, my liege,&quot; said De Vaux, &quot;take it less violently--you will be heard without doors, where such speeches are but too current already among the common soldiery, and engender discord and contention in the Christian host.
&quot;I recollect the Marquis replied,&quot; said De Vaux, &quot;that his limbs were of flesh, not of iron, and that he would rather bear the heart of a man than of a beast, though that beast were the lion, But I see how it is--we shall end where we began, without hope of praying at the Sepulchre until Heaven shall restore King Richard to health.&quot;
His love and devotion to the King was like the vivid affection of the old English mastiff to his master, leaving him churlish and inaccessible to all others even towards those to whom he was indifferent--and rough and dangerous to any against whom he entertained a prejudice.
It may be added that, as being himself a blunt and downright Englishman, unaccustomed to conceal the slightest movement either of love or of dislike, he accounted the fair-spoken courtesy which the Scots had learned, either from imitation of their frequent allies, the French, or which might have arisen from their own proud and reserved character, as a false and astucious mark of the most dangerous designs against their neighbours, over whom he believed, with genuine English confidence, they could, by fair manhood, never obtain any advantage.
This was the most metaphorical speech which Thomas of Gilsland was ever known to utter, the rather, perhaps (as will sometimes happen), that it did not entirely express his own sentiments, being somewhat a lover of good cheer and splendid accommodation.
He also cast around a glance of examination, which implied pity not altogether unmingled with contempt, to which, perhaps, it is as nearly akin as it is said to be to love.

&quot;Nay, your Majesty will pardon me to remind you that I have by mine office right to grant liberty to men of gentle blood to keep them a hound or two within camp, just to cherish the noble art of venerie; and besides, it were a sin to have maimed or harmed a thing so noble as this gentleman&#39;s dog.&quot;
I think it is scarce known in the camp that your royal consort is on a pilgrimage; and even the princes may not have been aware, as the Queen has been sequestered from company since your love prohibited her attendance in case of infection.&quot;
I tell thee he loves me as I love him--as noble adversaries ever love each other.
The Archbishop of Tyre was the first to whom he confided his doubts, knowing his interest with his master, Richard, who both loved and honoured that sagacious prelate.
He wearied his attendants by demanding from them amusements, and the breviary of the priest, the romance of the clerk, even the harp of his favourite minstrel, were had recourse to in vain.
He was scarcely known to the King of England, even by sight, although, tenacious of his rank, as devout in the adoration of the lady of his secret heart, he had never been absent on those occasions when the munificence and hospitality of England opened the Court of its monarch to all who held a certain rank in chivalry.
Kenneth attempted to speak, but was unable to express himself distinctly; the consciousness of his too ambitious love, and the keen, falcon glance with which Coeur de Lion seemed to penetrate his inmost soul, combining to disconcert him.
Hark thee, Sir Knight, I love the Scottish people; they are hardy, though dogged and stubborn, and, I think, true men in the main, though the necessity of state has sometimes constrained them to be dissemblers.
I deserve some love at their hand, for I have voluntarily done what they could not by arms have extorted from me any more than from my predecessors, I have re-established the fortresses of Roxburgh and Berwick, which lay in pledge to England; I have restored your ancient boundaries; and, finally, I have renounced a claim to homage upon the crown of England, which I thought unjustly forced on you.
said King Richard, painfully suppressing the passion with which his heart was almost bursting.
Hark ye--to become enamoured of the moon would be but an act of folly; but to leap from the battlements of a lofty tower, in the wild hope of coming within her sphere, were self-destructive madness.&quot;
&quot;Our brother of France loves not sick-beds,&quot; said Richard; &quot;yet, had Philip been ill, I had stood by his couch long since.--Jocelyn, lay me the couch more fairly--it is tumbled like a stormy sea.
The baron whispered the chamberlain, probably to know whether the Marquis spoke truly, and then replied, &quot;My lords, if you will hold your patience, you are welcome to enter with us; but if you interrupt, by action or threat, this accomplished physician in his duty, be it known that, without respect to your high quality, I will enforce your absence from Richard&#39;s tent; for know, I am so well satisfied of the virtue of this man&#39;s medicines, that were Richard himself to refuse them, by our Lady of Lanercost, I think I could find in my heart to force him to take the means of his cure whether he would or no.--Move onward, El Hakim.&quot;
&quot;Mastiffs are a faithful race,&quot; said Conrade; &quot;and the King their Master has won their love by being ready to wrestle, brawl, or revel amongst the foremost of them, whenever the humour seized him.&quot;
said the Marquis of Montserrat, whose love of sarcasm often outran his policy and discretion; &quot;swearest thou by that on the hill of Zion, which was built by King Solomon, or by that symbolical, emblematical edifice, which is said to be spoken of in the councils held in the vaults of your Preceptories, as something which infers the aggrandizement of thy valiant and venerable Order?&quot;
But though Conrade was familiar with the custom, and had heard the warning voice on all former occasions as a matter of habit, yet it came at the present moment so strongly in contact with his own train of thought, that it seemed a voice from Heaven warning him against the iniquity which his heart meditated.
But the Archduke, though not deficient in bravery, was so infinitely inferior to Coeur de Lion in that ardour of mind which wooed danger as a bride, that the King very soon held him in a certain degree of contempt.
But it served partly to intimate the character of the man, that, although desirous to show attention to the Marquis of Montserrat, whom he had courteously placed at his right hand, he gave much more of his attention to his SPRUCH-SPRECHER--that is, his man of conversation, or SAYER-OF-SAYINGS--who stood behind the Duke&#39;s right shoulder.
Here the orator, jingling his staff, interrupted the bard to intimate to the party--what they might not have inferred from the description--that their royal host was the party indicated, and a full-crowned goblet went round to the acclamation, HOCH LEBE DER HERZOG LEOPOLD!
The devotion of his ambitious and high-placed affection inflamed his military enthusiasm.
From time to time, also, he lowered his lofty head, and wagged his tail, as his master passed and repassed him in the short turns which he took upon his post; or, when the knight stood silent and abstracted leaning on his lance, and looking up towards heaven, his faithful attendant ventured sometimes, in the phrase of romance, &quot;to disturb his thoughts,&quot; and awaken him from his reverie, by thrusting his large rough snout into the knight&#39;s gauntleted hand, to solicit a transitory caress.
It was impossible, he thought, that the lady of his love should have sent him such a message by such a messenger; yet his voice trembled as he said, &quot;Go to, Nectabanus.
The rosebuds, withered as they were, were still treasured under his cuirass, and nearest to his heart.
&quot;Nectabanus, thou shalt be made ambassador to Prester John&#39;s court, to show them how wisely thou canst discharge thee of a mission.&quot;
Struck to the heart with shame and resentment at what he had heard, Sir Kenneth was about to attempt his escape from the tent at all hazards, when what followed arrested his purpose.
It may be a lesson will do good upon her; for, credit me, Calista, I have sometimes thought she has let this Northern adventurer sit nearer her heart than prudence would sanction.&quot;
O Lady Edith, others have influence on the iron breasts of warriors as well as you--the heart even of a lion is made of flesh, not of stone; and, believe me, I have interest enough with Richard to save this knight, in whose fate Lady Edith is so deeply concerned, from the penalty of disobeying his royal commands.&quot;
&quot;For the love of the blessed Cross, most royal lady,&quot; said Edith--and Sir Kenneth, with feelings which it were hard to unravel, heard her prostrate herself at the Queen&#39;s feet--&quot;for the love of our blessed Lady, and of every holy saint in the calendar, beware what you do!
A thin cloud had obscured the moon, too, at the very instant of his leaving the tent, and Sir Kenneth had to struggle with this inconvenience at a moment when the dizziness of his head and the fullness of his heart scarce left him powers of intelligence sufficient to direct his motions.
His next, which to some persons, but scarce to any who have made intimate acquaintances among the canine race, may appear strange, was to examine the condition of his faithful Roswal, mortally wounded, as it seemed, in discharging the duty which his master had been seduced to abandon.
Thou hast been trained from thy post--ay, trained by the rosy cheek and black eye of one of those houris, to whom you Nazarenes vow rather such service as is due to Allah, than such love as may lawfully be rendered to forms of clay like our own.
&quot;Saladin is courted on all sides.
Then, moderating his tone, by dint of much effort he restrained his indignation, and, veiling it under the appearance of contemptuous doubt, he prosecuted the conversation, in order to get as much knowledge as possible of the plot, as he deemed it, against the honour and happiness of her whom he loved not the less that his passion had ruined, apparently, his fortunes, at once, and his honour.--&quot;And what Christian,&quot; he said, With tolerable calmness, &quot;would sanction a union so unnatural as that of a Christian maiden with an unbelieving Saracen?&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>What is it to thee if she marry Saracen or Christian?
The Queen Berengaria loved her husband passionately, but she feared the loftiness and roughness of his character; and as she felt herself not to be his match in intellect, was not much pleased to see that he would often talk with Edith Plantagenet in preference to herself, simply because he found more amusement in her conversation, a more comprehensive understanding, and a more noble cast of thoughts and sentiments, than his beautiful consort exhibited.
It was then, and in the chapel at that holy place, connected from above with a Carmelite nunnery, from beneath with the cell of the anchorite, that one of the Queen&#39;s attendants remarked that secret sign of intelligence which Edith had made to her lover, and failed not instantly to communicate it to her Majesty.
Thus she continued talking thick and fast, and heaping together all sorts of inconsistencies, with the vain expectation of persuading both Edith and herself that no harm could come of a frolic which in her heart she now bitterly repented.
I love to know how brave souls meet death.&quot;
Caressing her fair head, and mingling his large fingers in her beautiful and dishevelled locks, he raised and tenderly kissed the cherub countenance which seemed desirous to hide itself in his hand.
&quot;And, once more, what seeks the lady of my heart in her knight&#39;s pavilion at this early and unwonted hour?&quot;
&quot;Nay, my royal liege and love, &#39;tis but a silken banner neglected.
Or is it some lovesick woman who cares not for her own fame in comparison of the life of her paramour?
&quot;He was indeed my lover, and a most true one; but never sought he grace from me by look or word--contented with such humble observance as men pay to the saints.
&quot;It is impossible she can have loved this knight,&quot; said Florise to Calista, her senior in attendance upon the Queen&#39;s person.
Severe restrictions, painful observances, fasts, and penance, are necessary on the part of the sage who uses this mode of cure; and if, through neglect of these preparations, by his love of ease, or his indulgence of sensual appetite, he omits to cure at least twelve persons within the course of each moon, the virtue of the divine gift departs from the amulet, and both the last patient and the physician will be exposed to speedy misfortune, neither will they survive the year.
&quot;Know, then,&quot; he said, &quot;that: through every court of Europe and Asia--to Moslem and Nazarene--to knight and lady--wherever harp is heard and sword worn--wherever honour is loved and infamy detested--to every quarter of the world--will I denounce thee, Melech Ric, as thankless and ungenerous; and even the lands--if there be any such--that never heard of thy renown shall yet be acquainted with thy shame!&quot;
&quot;But not without renown, monk--not without the tears of the lady of my love!
&quot;DO I not know, CAN I not estimate the value of minstrel&#39;s praise and of lady&#39;s love?&quot;
Richard, if I thought that rending the bloody veil from my horrible fate could make thy proud heart stoop to the discipline of the church, I could find in my heart to tell thee a tale, which I have hitherto kept gnawing at my vitals in concealment, like the self-devoted youth of heathenesse.
But while the noblest ladies in Palestine strove which should wind garlands for my helmet, my love was fixed--unalterably and devotedly fixed--on a maiden of low degree.
I too sought the cloister; and Satan, who had marked me for his own, breathed into my heart a vapour of spiritual pride, which could only have had its source in his own infernal regions.
Thou art proud of heart, loose of life, bloody of hand.
&quot;He raves,&quot; said Richard, turning from the solitary to De Vaux, as one who felt some pain from a sarcasm which yet he could not resent; then turned him calmly, and somewhat scornfully, to the anchoret, as he replied, &quot;Thou hast found a fair bevy of daughters, reverend father, to one who hath been but few months married; but since I must put them from my roof, it were but like a father to provide them with suitable matches.
&quot;O heart of steel, and hand of iron,&quot; said the anchoret, &quot;upon whom example, as well as advice, is alike thrown away!
His great vassal, the Earl of Champagne, had adopted the same resolution; and it could not excite surprise that Leopold of Austria, affronted as he had been by Richard, was glad to embrace an opportunity of deserting a cause in which his haughty opponent was to be considered as chief.
&quot;As a joint sovereign, the sworn ally,&quot; replied the prelate, &quot;of the mighty Richard--his relative, if it may be permitted, by marriage.&quot;
&quot;By marriage!&quot;
&quot;My sanction to marry my kinswoman to an infidel!&quot;
&quot;If so, the king lives not on earth to whom I would grant the hand of a kinswoman, ay, or sister, sooner than to my noble Saladin--ay, though the one came to lay crown and sceptre at her feet, and the other had nothing to offer but his good sword and better heart!&quot;
moreover, the hermit of Engaddi, few of whose words have fallen fruitless to the ground, is possessed fully with the belief that there is a calling of the Saracens and the other heathen approaching, to which this marriage shall be matter of induction.
For why should I not seek for brotherhood and alliance with a Saracen, brave, just, generous--who loves and honours a worthy foe, as if he were a friend--whilst the Princes of Christendom shrink from the side of their allies, and forsake the cause of Heaven and good knighthood?
Let not, therefore, strife be betwixt us for the symbol of our more worldly dignities; but let Leopold restore the pennon of England, if he has it in his power, and Richard will say, though from no motive save his love for Holy Church, that he repents him of the hasty mood in which he did insult the standard of Austria.&quot;
Since the royal Richard has asked the truth from us, he must neither be surprised nor angry when he hears one, to whom worldly pomp is prohibited, and secular authority is nothing, saving so far as it advances the prosperity of God&#39;s Temple, and the prostration of the lion which goeth about seeking whom he may devour--when he hears, I say, such a one as I tell him the truth in reply to his question; which truth, even while I speak it, is, I know, confirmed by the heart of every one who hears me, however respect may stifle their voices.&quot;
Richard, the unsuspicious object of the dark treachery detailed in the closing part of the last chapter, having effected, for the present at least, the triumphant union of the Crusading princes in a resolution to prosecute the war with vigour, had it next at heart to establish tranquillity in his own family; and, now that he could judge more temperately, to inquire distinctly into the circumstances leading to the loss of his banner, and the nature and the extent of the connection betwixt his kinswoman Edith and the banished adventurer from Scotland.
The wily Lady Calista, accustomed from her earliest childhood to fathom the intrigues of a court, and watch the indications of a sovereign&#39;s will, hastened back to the Queen with the speed of a lapwing, charged with the King&#39;s commands that she should expect a speedy visit from him; to which the bower-lady added a commentary founded on her own observation, tending to show that Richard meant just to preserve so much severity as might bring his royal consort to repent of her frolic, and then to extend to her and all concerned his gracious pardon.
Berengaria well knew the power of her charms and the extent of Richard&#39;s affection, and felt assured that she could make her own terms good, now that the first tremendous explosion of his anger had expended itself without mischief.
He tried in vain to reason with one whose very jealousy of his affection rendered her incapable of listening to argument, nor could he bring himself to use the restraint of lawful authority to a creature so beautiful in the midst of her unreasonable displeasure.
By Our Lady, such a melancholy countenance, and this ample sable veil, might make men think thou wert a new-made widow, or had lost a betrothed lover, at least.
&quot;I see, my fair cousin,&quot; said Richard, &quot;you are of those pretty ones who think an absent lover as bad as none, or as a dead one.
Let not anger or grief for the absence of thy lover make thee unjust to thy kinsman, who, notwithstanding all thy techiness, values thy good report as high as that of any one living.&quot;
&quot;The absence of my lover?&quot;
said the Lady Edith, &quot;But yes, he may be well termed my lover, who hath paid so dear for the title.
answered Edith--&quot;not should Richard himself embrace the false religion, which he crossed the seas to expel from Palestine.&quot;
The King of England, who, as it was emphatically said of his successor Henry the Eighth, loved to look upon A MAN, was well pleased with the thews, sinews, and symmetry of him whom he now surveyed, and questioned him in the lingua franca, &quot;Art thou a pagan?&quot;
Arrived at the tent, he threw himself, without speech of any kind, upon a couch of dressed buffalo&#39;s hide, which was pointed out to him by his conductor, and hiding his face betwixt his hands, groaned heavily, as if his heart were on the point of bursting.
Sir Kenneth made an effort to thank the Hakim, but his heart was too full, and the indistinct sounds which accompanied his abortive attempts to reply induced the kind physician to desist from his premature endeavours at consolation.
Thou sayest in thy heart that the sage should have given you, as his guest, the younger and better horse, and reserved the old one for himself.
After this exordium, Hassan uplifted his voice, and began a tale of love and magic, intermixed with feats of warlike achievement, and ornamented with abundant quotations from the Persian poets, with whose compositions the orator seemed familiar.
I will not seem to heed thee or return thy affection, since it would serve but to load our parting with yet more bitterness.&quot;
The Scottish knight, who had now begun to recover his breath and powers of attention, could not help acknowledging in his heart the advantage possessed by these Eastern warriors in a race of animals, alike proper for advance or retreat, and so admirably adapted to the level and sandy deserts of Arabia and Syria.
Liberty, fame, successful love, appeared to be the certain and not very distant prospect of the enslaved exile, the dishonoured knight, even of the despairing lover who had placed his hopes of happiness so far beyond the prospect of chance, in her wildest possibilities, serving to countenance his wishes.
&quot;Was it not through thy conversation, and thy account of the beauties which grace the court of the Melech Ric, that I ventured me thither in disguise, and thereby procured a sight the most blessed that I have ever enjoyed--that I ever shall enjoy, until the glories of Paradise beam on my eyes?&quot;
True, thou wert under sentence of death at the time; but, in my case, had my head been dropping from the trunk, the last strained glances of my eyeballs had distinguished with delight such a vision of loveliness, and the head would have rolled itself towards the incomparable houris, to kiss with its quivering lips the hem of their vestments.
By the tomb of the Prophet, I scarce think that the houri who shall present to me the diamond cup of immortality will deserve so warm a caress!&quot;
I warrant, since thou exactest such profound respect to yonder tender piece of frailty, whose every motion, step, and look bespeaks her very woman, less than absolute adoration must not be yielded to her of the dark tresses and nobly speaking eye.
SHE indeed, I will allow, hath in her noble port and majestic mien something at once pure and firm; yet even she, when pressed by opportunity and a forward lover, would, I warrant thee, thank him in her heart rather for treating her as a mortal than as a goddess.&quot;
&quot;I LOVED her,&quot; answered Sir Kenneth, after a pause, &quot;as a man loves Heaven&#39;s grace, and sued for her favour like a sinner for Heaven&#39;s pardon.&quot;
&quot;And you love her no longer?&quot;
&quot;Alas,&quot; answered Sir Kenneth, &quot;I am no longer worthy to love her.
&quot;When thou, a poor and obscure soldier, didst so boldly and so highly fix thine affection, tell me, hadst thou good hope of its issue?&quot;
&quot;Love exists not without hope,&quot; replied the knight; &quot;but mine was as nearly allied to despair as that of the sailor swimming for his life, who, as he surmounts billow after billow, catches by intervals some gleam of the distant beacon, which shows him there is land in sight, though his sinking heart and wearied limbs assure him that he shall never reach it.&quot;
The song of the nightingale will sooner blight the rose-bower she loves than will the words of the Soldan offend the ears of the lovely kinswoman of England.&quot;
The reader can now have little doubt who the Ethiopian slave really was, with what purpose he had sought Richard&#39;s camp, and wherefore and with what hope he now stood close to the person of that Monarch, as, surrounded by his valiant peers of England and Normandy, Coeur de Lion stood on the summit of Saint George&#39;s Mount, with the Banner of England by his side, borne by the most goodly person in the army, being his own natural brother, William with the Long Sword, Earl of Salisbury, the offspring of Henry the Second&#39;s amour with the celebrated Rosamond of Woodstock.
On they passed, troop after troop, banners waving, spears glancing, plumes dancing, in long perspective--a host composed of different nations, complexions, languages, arms, and appearances, but all fired, for the time, with the holy yet romantic purpose of rescuing the distressed daughter of Zion from her thraldom, and redeeming the sacred earth, which more than mortal had trodden, from the yoke of the unbelieving pagan.

&quot;Let no man lay hand upon them,&quot; said Richard, &quot;as he loves his own life!
Yet this inconstancy is such, As thou, too, shalt adore; I could not love thee, love so much, Loved I not honour more.
[A universal tradition ascribed to Sir Tristrem, famous for his love of the fair Queen Yseult, the laws concerning the practice of woodcraft, or VENERIE, as it was called, being those that related to the rules of the chase, which were deemed of much consequence during the Middle Ages.]
Now, speaking conjecturally, we think thou mightst find in that camp some cavalier who, for the love of truth and his own augmentation of honour, will do battle with this same traitor of Montserrat.&quot;
The Nubian raised his eyes and fixed them on the King with a look of eager ardour; then raised them to Heaven with such solemn gratitude that the water soon glistened in them; then bent his head, as affirming what Richard desired, and resumed his usual posture of submissive attention.
The Ethiopian raised his body proudly, looked full at the King, and laid his right hand on his heart.
And why, or how, can the royal Plantagenet consent that I should see his divine kinswoman, either as the messenger of the heathen Saladin, or as the guilty exile whom he so lately expelled from his camp--his audacious avowal of the affection which is his pride being the greatest enhancement of his guilt?
That Richard should consent to her receiving a letter from an infidel lover by the hands of one of such disproportioned rank are either of them circumstances equally incredible, and, at the same time, inconsistent with each other.
And yet&quot;--thus the proud swelling of his heart further suggested--&quot;Coeur de Lion, as he is called, might have measured the feelings of others by his own.
&quot;Rather like the bow of a Cupid, since he comes upon a lover&#39;s errand,&quot; said the Queen.--&quot;Gentle Neville, thou art ever prompt to pleasure us poor women, who have so little to pass away our idle moments.
We must see this messenger of love.
He pressed both his hands to his brow, as if to intimate the pain which he felt at being unable to obey her; but she turned from him in anger.
Their pains are past, their sorrows o&#39;er; And those that loved their steps must tread, When death shall join to part no more.&quot;
But worse than absence, worse than death, She wept her lover&#39;s sullied fame, And, fired with all the pride of birth, She wept a soldier&#39;s injured name.
This personage would have kneeled reverently to Richard, but the Monarch raised him in joyful haste, pressed him to his bosom warmly, and kissed him on either side of the face.
Why, so--well pulled!--and now I will tell thee, thou art a soldier as well as I, and we must brook each other&#39;s jests in the hall as each other&#39;s blows in the tourney, and love each other the harder we hit.
&quot;To see your Majesty in such cheerful mood,&quot; said the Lord of Gilsland, &quot;by my faith, I could remain till Blondel had achieved the great romance of King Arthur, which lasts for three days.&quot;
Then, accompanying his voice with the harp, so as to grace, but yet not drown, the sense of what he sung, he chanted in a sort of recitative one of those ancient adventures of love and knighthood which were wont of yore to win the public attention.
His full, manly, mellow voice, so absolutely under command of the purest taste, thrilled on every ear and to every heart.
Untroubled in his look, and untroubled in his breast, The knight the weed hath taken, and reverently hath kiss&#39;d.
&quot;Nay, first cherish thy fancy with a cup of fiery Chios wine,&quot; said the King.
Then deep blush&#39;d the Princess--yet kiss&#39;d she and press&#39;d The blood-spotted robes to her lips and her breast.
&quot;Is our cousin Edith,&quot; said the King, &quot;become insensible to the sound of the harp she once loved?&quot;
The hermit of Engaddi--he whom Popes and Councils have regarded as a prophet--hath read in the stars that thy marriage shall reconcile me with a powerful enemy, and that thy husband shall be Christian, leaving thus the fairest ground to hope that the conversion of the Soldan, and the bringing in of the sons of Ishmael to the pale of the church, will be the consequence of thy wedding with Saladin.
&quot;By my faith, wench,&quot; said the King, &quot;thou hast unhorsed me with that very word, so we will kiss and be friends.
But come, we have reached the pavilion, and must part; not in unkindness thou, oh--nay, thou must seal it with thy lip as well as thy hand, sweet Edith--it is my right as a sovereign to kiss my pretty vassals.&quot;
The former route of the Queen&#39;s pilgrimage to Engaddi had been on the other side of the chain of mountains, so that the ladies were strangers to the scenery of the desert; and though Berengaria knew her husband&#39;s disposition too well not to endeavour to seem interested in what he was pleased either to say or to sing, she could not help indulging some female fears when she found herself in the howling wilderness with so small an escort, which seemed almost like a moving speck on the bosom of the plain, and knew at the same time they were not so distant from the camp of Saladin, but what they might be in a moment surprised and swept off by an overpowering host of his fiery-footed cavalry, should the pagan be faithless enough to embrace an opportunity thus tempting.
The Soldan, turning to the litters, made an obeisance as lowly as if looking towards Mecca, and kissed the sand in token of respect.
&quot;Nothing explicit,&quot; replied the Soldan; &quot;but from much that passed between us, I conceive his love is too highly placed to be happy in its issue.&quot;
Or, if this high-born dame loved him better than myself, who can say that she did not justice to a knight of her own religion, who is full of nobleness?&quot;
&quot;Our poets of the Eastern countries say that a valiant camel-driver is worthy to kiss the lip of a fair Queen, when a cowardly prince is not worthy to salute the hem of her garment.
&quot;Nay, then,&quot; said Richard, &quot;if he loves not wine, that lightener of the human heart, his conversion is not to be hoped for, and the prediction of the mad priest of Engaddi goes like chaff down the wind.&quot;
&quot;I have ever said thou hast a sort of wit, De Vaux; marry, one must strike thee with a sledge-hammer ere it can be made to sparkle.
The King kissed it in token of reconciliation, and then proceeded.
&quot;Maidens talk ever thus,&quot; said the King; &quot;but when the favoured lover presses his suit, she says, with a sigh, her stars had decreed otherwise.&quot;
Hark thee--I think I know most of thy frailties by heart, so we may omit the detail, which may be somewhat a long one, and begin with the absolution.
&quot;This craven,&quot; he thought, &quot;will lose the day in pure faintness and cowardice of heart, which he calls tender conscience.
How I pity that noble Soldan, who knows but of love as it is known to those of inferior nature!&quot;
&quot;He knew from experience that my heart is somewhat softer than if I wrote myself Plantagenet.&quot;
&quot;Thy heart soft?
Who would not have said that I was that enemy most dangerous to Richard, whose enmity was to be ended by marriage with his kinswoman?
&quot;He who does on a disguise must make the sentiments of his heart and the learning of his head accord with the dress which he assumes.
Conrade murdered?--And by the Grand Master, his sponsor and most intimate friend!&quot;
Of their further speech the terrified dwarf remembered little, save that Conrade implored the Grand Master not to break a wounded reed, and that the Templar struck him to the heart with a Turkish dagger, with the words ACCIPE HOC!--words which long afterwards haunted the terrified imagination of the concealed witness.
I, unless worthier offers, will lay down my gauntlet in behalf of Christendom, and in all love and honour we will do mortal battle for the possession of Jerusalem.&quot;
&quot;If not for Jerusalem, then,&quot; said Richard, in the tone of one who would entreat a favour of an intimate friend, &quot;yet, for the love of honour, let us run at least three courses with grinded lances?&quot;
&quot;Even this,&quot; said Saladin, half smiling at Coeur de Lion&#39;s affectionate earnestness for the combat--&quot;even this I may not lawfully do.
Had I a son to hold the sceptre when I fell, I might have had the liberty, as I have the will, to brave this bold encounter; but your own Scripture saith that when the herdsman is smitten, the sheep are scattered.&quot;

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I have only further to intimate, that Mr. Peter Pattieson, in arranging these Tales for the press, hath more consulted his own fancy than the accuracy of the narrative; nay, that he hath sometimes blended two or three stories together for the mere grace of his plots.
And the insults and scorn to which this exposed him, had poisoned his heart with fierce and bitter feelings, which, from other points in his character, do not appear to have been more largely infused into his original temperament than that of his fellow-men.
At heart, he was superstitious, and planted many rowans (mountain ashes) around his hut, as a certain defence against necromancy.
We have stated that David Ritchie loved objects of natural beauty.
David was never affectionate to her; it was not in his nature; but he endured her.
The author saw this poor, and, it may be said, unhappy man, in autumn 1797 being then, as he has the happiness still to remain, connected by ties of intimate friendship with the family of the venerable Dr. Adam Fergusson, the philosopher and historian, who then resided at the mansion-house of Halyards, in the vale of Manor, about a mile from Ritchie&#39;s hermitage, the author was upon a visit at Halyards, which lasted for several days, and was made acquainted with this singular anchorite, whom Dr. Fergusson considered as an extraordinary character, and whom he assisted in various ways, particularly by the occasional loan of books.
&quot;Mony thanks to ye, Mr. Patrick, ye&#39;re kend to a&#39; the country for a kind heart.
It will do the auld wife&#39;s heart gude--mair by token, when she kens it comes frae you--and maist of a&#39; gin ye&#39;ll come up and take your share, for I reckon ye are lonesome now in the auld tower, and a&#39; your folk at that weary Edinburgh.
&quot;Very true, Hobbie, and I will come to the Heugh-foot to dinner to-morrow with all my heart.&quot;
The auld Laird of Ellieslaw has the auld riding blood far hetter at his heart than ye hae--troth, he kens naething about thae newfangled notions o&#39; peace and quietness--he&#39;s a&#39; for the auld-warld doings o&#39; lifting and laying on, and he has a wheen stout lads at his back too, and keeps them weel up in heart, and as fu&#39; o&#39; mischief as young colts.
The young sportsman hailed this extraordinary appearance twice, without receiving any answer, or attending to the pinches by which his companion endeavoured to intimate that their best course was to walk on, without giving farther disturbance to a being of such singular and preternatural exterior.
&quot;Troth am I--Grace make me thankful, I&#39;se never deny it.--But will ye tell me now, Earnscliff, you that have been at college, and the high-school of Edinburgh, and got a&#39; sort o&#39; lair where it was to be best gotten--will ye tell me--no that it&#39;s ony concern of mine in particular,--but I heard the priest of St. John&#39;s, and our minister, bargaining about it at the Winter fair, and troth they baith spak very weel--Now, the priest says it&#39;s unlawful to marry ane&#39;s cousin; but I cannot say I thought he brought out the Gospel authorities half sae weel as our minister--our minister is thought the best divine and the best preacher atween this and Edinburgh--Dinna ye think he was likely to be right?&quot;
&quot;Certainly marriage, by all protestant Christians, is held to be as free as God made it by the Levitical law; so, Hobbie, there can be no bar, legal or religious, betwixt you and Miss Armstrong.&quot;
&quot;Hout awa&#39; wi&#39; your joking, Earnscliff,&quot; replied his companion,--&quot;ye are angry aneugh yoursell if ane touches you a bit, man, on the sooth side of the jest--No that I was asking the question about Grace, for ye maun ken she&#39;s no my cousin-germain out and out, but the daughter of my uncle&#39;s wife by her first marriage, so she&#39;s nae kith nor kin to me--only a connexion like.
&quot;Love me, love my dog,&quot; answered Earnscliff.
O weary fa&#39; thae evil days!--what can evil beings be coming for to distract a poor country, now it&#39;s peacefully settled, and living in love and law--O weary on him!
&quot;O, my bonny bairn,&quot; said the old dame (for, in the kindness of her heart, she extended her parental style to all in whom she was interested)---&quot;You should beware mair than other folk--there&#39;s been a heavy breach made in your house wi&#39; your father&#39;s bloodshed, and wi&#39; law-pleas, and losses sinsyne;--and you are the flower of the flock, and the lad that will build up the auld bigging again (if it be His will) to be an honour to the country, and a safeguard to those that dwell in it--you, before others, are called upon to put yoursell in no rash adventures--for yours was aye ower venturesome a race, and muckle harm they have got by it.&quot;
I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind; For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog, That I might love thee something.--TIMON OF ATHENS On the following morning, after breakfast, Earnscliff took leave of his hospitable friends, promising to return in time to partake of the venison, which had arrived from his house.
The rest of his features were of the coarse, rough-hewn stamp, with which a painter would equip a giant in romance; to which was added the wild, irregular, and peculiar expression, so often seen in the countenances of those whose persons are deformed.
If I cannot send disease into families, and murrain among the herds, can I attain the same end so well as by prolonging the lives of those who can serve the purpose of destruction as effectually?--If Alice of Bower had died in winter, would young Ruthwin have been slain for her love the last spring?--Who thought of penning their cattle beneath the tower when the Red Reiver of Westburnflat was deemed to be on his death-bed?--My draughts, my skill, recovered him.
He rose hastily; but, ere he withdrew into the hut, he added, with great vehemence, &quot;Yet, lest you still think my apparent benefits to mankind flow from the stupid and servile source, called love of our fellow-creatures, know, that were there a man who had annihilated my soul&#39;s dearest hope--who had torn my heart to mammocks, and seared my brain till it glowed like a volcano, and were that man&#39;s fortune and life in my power as completely as this frail potsherd&quot; (he snatched up an earthen cup which stood beside him), &quot;I would not dash him into atoms thus&quot;--(he flung the vessel with fury against the wall),--&quot;No!&quot;
CHAPTER V. The bleakest rock upon the loneliest heath Feels, in its barrenness, some touch of spring; And, in the April dew, or beam of May, Its moss and lichen freshen and revive; And thus the heart, most sear&#39;d to human pleasure, Melts at the tear, joys in the smile, of woman.--BEAUMONT As the season advanced, the weather became more genial, and the Recluse was more frequently found occupying the broad flat stone in the front of his mansion.
Toys and merry-makings in childhood--love and its absurdities in youth--spadille and basto in age, shall succeed each other as objects of pursuit--flowers and butterflies in spring--butterflies and thistle-down in summer--withered leaves in autumn and winter--all pursued, all caught, all flung aside.--Stand apart; your fortune is said.&quot;
All the advantages I have detailed, all and each of them have their corresponding evils--unsuccessful love, crossed affections, the gloom of a convent, or an odious alliance.
Show me that rose, or but one leaf of it, were it withered as my heart is--if it should be in my fiercest and wildest movements of rage against a hateful world, still it will recall gentler thoughts to my bosom, and perhaps afford happier prospects to thine.
Come thyself; and the heart and the doors that are shut against every other earthly being, shall open to thee and to thy sorrows.
&quot;But if your father,&quot; said Miss Vere, &quot;were to say,--Thus do, or--&quot; &quot;I would stand to the consequences of his OR, were he the most cruel father that ever was recorded in romance, to fill up the alternative.&quot;
&quot;And adieu to Ellieslaw Castle, with all my heart,&quot; said her friend, &quot;if I once saw you fairly out of it, and settled under some kinder protector than he whom nature has given you.
You know, that, independent of my father&#39;s consent, without which I never will marry any one, and which, in the case you point at, would never be granted; independent, too, of our knowing nothing of young Earnscliff&#39;s inclinations, but by your own vivid conjectures and fancies--besides all this, there is the fatal brawl!&quot;
You laugh at my skill in romance; but, I assure you, should your history be written, like that of many a less distressed and less deserving heroine, the well-judging reader would set you down for the lady and the love of Earnscliff; from the very obstacle which you suppose so insurmountable.&quot;
&quot;But these are not the days of romance, but of sad reality, for there stands the castle of Ellieslaw.&quot;
Fain would Isabella have done the same had she dared; but her father stood near, displeasure already darkening on a countenance peculiarly qualified to express the harsher passions, and she was compelled to receive the unwelcome assiduities of her detested suitor.
All are of a piece, one mass of wickedness, selfishness, and ingratitude--wretches, who sin even in their devotions; and of such hardness of heart, that they do not, without hypocrisy, even thank the Deity himself for his warm sun and pure air.&quot;
As he was plunged in these gloomy soliloquies, he heard the tramp of a horse on the other side of his enclosure, and a strong clear bass voice singing with the liveliness inspired by a light heart, Canny Hobbie Elliot, canny Hobbie now, Canny Hobbie Elliot, I&#39;se gang alang wi&#39; you.
The Dwarf turned his rage on the young farmer; and, by a sudden effort, far more powerful than Hobbie expected from such a person, freed his wrist from his grasp, and offered the dagger at his heart.
The connexion between them and their foster-children was considered a tie far too dearly intimate to be broken; and it usually happened, in the course of years, that the nurse became a resident in the family of her foster-son, assisting in the domestic duties, and receiving all marks of attention and regard from the heads of the family.
But gang na forward; it wad break your young heart, hinny, to see what my auld een hae seen this morning.&quot;
At ony rate, I will keep up a heart, or they will lose theirs a&#39;thegither.&quot;
His sisters threw themselves upon him, and almost stifled him with their caresses, as if to prevent his looking round to distinguish the absence of one yet more beloved.
I&#39;ll keep my heart doun as weel as I can, and stroke him wi&#39; the hair; and if the warst come to the warst, it&#39;s but wringing the head o&#39; him about at last.&quot;
&quot;Ye may have lost all this,&quot; answered Hobbie, in the bitterness of emotion; &quot;land and friends, goods and gear; ye may hae lost them a&#39;,--but ye ne&#39;er can hae sae sair a heart as mine, for ye ne&#39;er lost nae Grace Armstrong.
This took away from the act which had been perpetrated the appearance of private animosity, or love of plunder; and Earnscliff was now disposed to regard it as a symptom of civil war.
Earnscliff, though he doubted the possibility of recognising a fair maiden&#39;s hand at such a distance from the eye of the lover, would say nothing to damp his friend&#39;s animated hopes, and it was resolved to summon the garrison.
Bide till the meeting at Castleton, as ye hae greed; and if he disna make ye amends, then we&#39;ll hae it out o&#39; his heart&#39;s blood.
This cold-blooded reasoning went ill down with the unfortunate lover; but, as he could only obtain the assistance of his neighbours and kinsmen on their own terms, he was compelled to acquiesce in their notions of good faith and regular procedure.
An it werena for my mother and sisters, and poor Grace, I could find in my heart to put spurs to the beast, and loup ower the scaur into the water to make an end o&#39;t a&#39;.&quot;
&quot;It wasna my fault,&quot; said Grace, endeavouring to cover her face with her hands to hide at once her blushes, and escape the storm of hearty kisses with which her bridegroom punished her simple stratagem,--&quot;It wasna my fault, Hobbie; ye should kiss Jeanie and the rest o&#39; them, for they hae the wyte o&#39;t.&quot;
&quot;And so I will,&quot; said Hobbie, and embraced and kissed his sisters and grandmother a hundred times, while the whole party half-laughed, half-cried, in the extremity of their joy.
&quot;Then, O my dear bairn,&quot; said the good old dame, who lost no opportunity of teaching her lesson of religion at those moments when the heart was best open to receive it,--&quot;Then, O my son, give praise to Him that brings smiles out o&#39; tears and joy out o&#39; grief, as He brought light out o&#39; darkness and the world out o&#39; naething.
There was a solemn pause of one or two minutes employed in the exercise of mental devotion, which expressed, in purity and sincerity, the gratitude of the affectionate family to that Providence who had unexpectedly restored to their embraces the friend whom they had lost.

</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>said Hobbie, whose heart fluttered between glee at the revival of his hopes and prospects in life, and suspicion of the purpose for which this assistance was afforded him---&quot;Mercy on us!
Ye see I hae been thinking it wad be a sair thing on twa young folk, like Grace and me, to put aff our marriage for mony years till I was abroad and came back again wi&#39; some gear; and they say folk maunna take booty in the wars as they did lang syne, and the queen&#39;s pay is a sma&#39; matter; there&#39;s nae gathering gear on that--and then my grandame&#39;s auld--and my sisters wad sit peengin&#39; at the ingle-side for want o&#39; me to ding them about--and Earnscliff, or the neighbourhood, or maybe your ainsell, Elshie, might want some good turn that Hob Elliot could do ye--and it&#39;s a pity that the auld house o&#39; the Heugh-foot should be wrecked a&#39;thegither.
On the morning preceding the night in which Hobbie&#39;s house was plundered and burnt, Miss Vere was requested by her father to accompany him in a walk through a distant part of the romantic grounds which lay round his castle of Ellieslaw.
From her father&#39;s silence, Isabella little doubted that he had chosen this distant and sequestered scene to resume the argument which they had so frequently maintained upon the subject of Sir Frederick&#39;s addresses, and that he was meditating in what manner he should most effectually impress upon her the necessity of receiving him as her suitor.
The only sentences which her father from time to time addressed to her, respected the beauties of the romantic landscape through which they strolled, and which varied its features at every step.
To these observations, although they seemed to come from a heart occupied by more gloomy as well as more important cares, Isabella endeavoured to answer in a manner as free and unconstrained as it was possible for her to assume, amid the involuntary apprehensions which crowded upon her imagination.
&quot;You are very obliging, Miss Vere, when it happens to suit you to be dutiful,&quot; said her unrelenting father, forcing himself at the same time from the affectionate grasp of her hand; &quot;but henceforward, child, I shall save myself the trouble of offering you unpleasant advice on any topic.
The despair he felt at his daughter&#39;s disappearance, was, in Dixon&#39;s phrase, such as would have melted the heart of a whin stane, and he was so much exhausted by his feelings, and the vain researches which he made to discover the track of the ravishers, that a considerable time elapsed ere he reached home, and communicated the alarm to his domestics.
These are not the days of romance, when ladies are carried off merely for their beauty.&quot;
&quot;And you argue, from this romantic letter of a very romantic young lady, Mr. Vere,&quot; said Ratcliffe, &quot;that young Earnscliff has carried off your daughter, and committed a very great and criminal act of violence, on no better advice and assurance than that of Miss Lucy Ilderton?&quot;
&quot;With all my heart,&quot; said Mareschal; &quot;the more mischief the better sport.&quot;
They walked into the house, leaving Ratcliffe and Mareschal standing together in the court.
&quot;Why, I love this poor exiled king with all my heart; and my father was an old Killiecrankie man, and I long to see some amends on the Unionist courtiers, that have bought and sold old Scotland, whose crown has been so long independent.&quot;
&quot;Perhaps so; but no lighter heart shall; and, to prevent it being made heavier by your remonstrances, I will bid you adieu, Mr. Ratcliffe, till dinner-time, when you shall see that my apprehensions have not spoiled my appetite.&quot;
There had been great preparations made at Ellieslaw Castle for the entertainment on this important day, when not only the gentlemen of note in the neighbourhood, attached to the Jacobite interest, were expected to rendezvous, but also many subordinate malecontents, whom difficulty of circumstances, love of change, resentment against England, or any of the numerous causes which inflamed men&#39;s passions at the time, rendered apt to join in perilous enterprise.
&quot;We shall shortly neither dare shoot a deer nor kiss a wench, without a certificate from the presbytery and kirk-treasurer,&quot; said Mareschal-Wells.
If the French fleet, with the king on board, has been chased off by the English, as this d--d scrawl seems to intimate, where are we?&quot;
You have a chapel in the castle--Doctor Hobbler is present among the company-this proof of your good faith to-night, and we are again joined in heart and hand.
&quot;I embrace it,&quot; said Ellieslaw; &quot;and I will leave you to talk upon our military preparations, while I go to prepare my daughter for so sudden a change of condition.&quot;
Nothing can save me but reconciliation with these men; and, to accomplish this, I have promised to Langley that Isabella shall marry him ere midnight, and to Mareschal, that she shall do so without compulsion.
I have but one remedy betwixt me and ruin--her consent to take a suitor whom she dislikes, upon such short notice as would disgust her, even were he a favoured lover--But I must trust to the romantic generosity of her disposition; and let me paint the necessity of her obedience ever so strongly, I cannot overcharge its reality.&quot;
Though a deceitful and ambitious man, he was not so devoid of natural affection but that he was shocked at the part he was about to act, in practising on the feelings of a dutiful and affectionate child; but the recollections, that, if he succeeded, his daughter would only be trepanned into an advantageous match, and that, if he failed, he himself was a lost man, were quite sufficient to drown all scruples.
said Isabella, with a sort of start, which expressed at least as much fear, as joy or affection.
&quot;Yes, Isabella,&quot; said Vere, &quot;your unhappy father, who comes now as a penitent to crave forgiveness of his daughter for an injury done to her in the excess of his affection, and then to take leave of her for ever.&quot;
&quot;Then, my child,&quot; said Vere, &quot;since you press me to name what I would a thousand times rather leave in silence, I must inform you that he will accept for ransom nothing but your hand in marriage, and that conferred before midnight this very evening!&quot;
&quot;My daughter,&quot; replied Ellieslaw, in a tone where offended authority seemed to struggle with parental affection, &quot;my child suspects me of inventing a false tale to work upon her feelings!
She cannot even comprehend the peril in which we stand, or how much we are in his power--Use your influence with him, for Heaven&#39;s sake, to modify proposals, to the acceptance of which I cannot, and will not, urge my child against all her own feelings, as well as those of delicacy and propriety, and oblige your loving cousin,--R. V.&quot; In the agitation of the moment, when her swimming eyes and dizzy brain could hardly comprehend the sense of what she looked upon, it is not surprising that Miss Vere should have omitted to remark that this letter seemed to rest her scruples rather upon the form and time of the proposed union, than on a rooted dislike to the suitor proposed to her.
For the rest, I can only say, that if she can make up her mind to the alliance at all--it is no time for mere maiden ceremony--my pretty cousin must needs consent to marry in haste, or we shall all repent at leisure, or rather have very little leisure to repent; which is all at present from him who rests your affectionate kinsman,--R. M.&quot; &quot;P.S.--Tell Isabella that I would rather cut the knight&#39;s throat after all, and end the dilemma that way, than see her constrained to marry him against her will.&quot;
Then raising her head, and drawing in her breath strongly ere she spoke, she said, with firmness,--&quot;Father, I consent to the marriage.&quot;
&quot;You shall not--you shall not,--my child--my dear child--you shall not embrace certain misery to free me from uncertain danger.&quot;
he expressed the real though momentary feelings of his heart.
&quot;Father,&quot; repeated Isabella, &quot;I will consent to this marriage.&quot;
Is not personal form, such as at least can be tolerated without horror and disgust, always represented as essential to our ideas of a friend, far more a lover?
Their death postponed the marriage, for which the day had been fixed.
He caught up a sword, pierced the heart of his friend&#39;s antagonist, was tried, and his life, with difficulty, redeemed from justice at the expense of a year&#39;s close imprisonment, the punishment of manslaughter.
As a temporary measure this might have been justifiable; but his hard-hearted friend, who, in consequence of his marriage, was now his nearest ally, prolonged his confinement, in order to enjoy the management of his immense estates.
&quot;I come to you, father,&quot; said Isabella, &quot;in my hour of adversity, even as you yourself commanded, when you promised your heart and your door should be open to my distress; but I fear--&quot; &quot;Ha!&quot;
The heart and the door that are shut against every other earthly being, shall be open to thee and to thy sorrows.&quot;
One by one, bolt and bar were then withdrawn, the heart of Isabella throbbing higher as these obstacles to their meeting were successively removed.
&quot;No--no marriage,&quot; replied Mareschal, &quot;there&#39;s my hand and glove on&#39;t.&quot;
&quot;It is one who comes to tell you,&quot; said the Dwarf, with the peculiar acrimony which usually marked his manner, &quot;that, in marrying that young lady, you wed neither the heiress of Ellieslaw, nor of Mauley Hall, nor of Polverton, nor of one furrow of land, unless she marries with MY consent; and to thee that consent shall never be given.
She held the hand of the Dwarf, which she kissed repeatedly and bathed with tears.
But no melting of the heart shall dissolve my resolution.
He kissed Isabella on the forehead, impressed another kiss on the brow of the statue by which she knelt, and left the chapel followed by Ratcliffe.
I think you will be of opinion, my love, that this secrecy must have had some strong motive.
He makes it a crime against me that I endeavoured to establish your marriage with Sir Frederick.
&quot;Mr. Ratcliffe mentioned Sir Edward&#39;s intention to settle a considerable sum upon me yearly, for my maintenance in foreign parts; but this my heart is too proud to accept from him.
I thought it right to intimate this to him pretty roundly, that whatever increase be settled upon you, it may be calculated so as to cover this necessary and natural encumbrance.
I shall willingly settle upon you the castle and manor of Ellieslaw, to show my parental affection and disinterested zeal for promoting your settlement in life.
And here I must make you aware, that though I have to complain of Mr. Ratcliffe&#39;s conduct to me personally, I, nevertheless, believe him a just and upright man, with whom you may safely consult on your affairs, not to mention that to cherish his good opinion will be the best way to retain that of your kinsman.
Meanwhile, I rest your loving father, RICHARD VERE.&quot;
All bar between the marriage of Earnscliff and Isabella was now removed, and the settlements which Ratcliffe produced on the part of Sir Edward Mauley, might have satisfied the cupidity of Ellieslaw himself.
Mareschal hunted, shot, and drank claret--tired of the country, went abroad, served three campaigns, came home, and married Lucy Ilderton.
His patriotism urged him to serve his country abroad, while his reluctance to leave his native soil pressed him rather to remain in the beloved island, and collect purses, watches, and rings on the highroads at home.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I love the royal bully, and will drink his health gladly, and Mistress Anne Boleyn&#39;s to boot.&quot;
In that year the young prince espoused Catherine of Arragon, our present queen, and soon afterwards died; whereupon the old king, not liking--for he loved his treasure better than his own flesh--to part with her dowry, gave her to his second son, Henry, our gracious sovereign, whom God preserve!
I love my king; and if he wishes to have a divorce, I hope his holiness the Pope will grant him one, that&#39;s all.&quot;
I will drink the health of King Henry&#39;s lawful consort, Catherine of Arragon; and I will add to it a wish that the Pope may forge her marriage chains to her royal husband faster than ever.&quot;
Her nose was slightly aquiline, but not enough so to detract from its beauty, and had a little retrousse; point that completed its attraction.
An excellent description of her has been given by a contemporary writer, the Comte de Chateaubriand, who, while somewhat disparaging her personal attractions, speaks in rapturous terms of her accomplishments: &quot;Anne,&quot; writes the Comte, &quot;avait un esprit si deslie qui c&#39;estoit a qui l&#39;ouiroit desgoiser; et ci venoitelle a poetiser, telle qu&#39; Orpheus, elle eust faict les ours et rochers attentifs: puis saltoit, balloit, et dancoit toutes dances Anglaises ou Estranges, et en imagina nombre qui ont garde son nom ou celluy du galant pour qui les feit: puis scavoit tous les jeux, qu&#39;elle jouoit avec non plus d&#39;heur que d&#39;habilite puis chantoit comme syrene, s&#39;accompagnant de luth; harpoit mieueix que le roy David, et manioit fort gentilment fleuste et rebec; puis s&#39;accoustroit de tant et si merveilleuses facons, que ses inventions, faisoient d&#39;elle le parangon de toutes des dames les plus sucrees de la court; mais nulle n&#39;avoit sa grace, laquelle, au dire d&#39;un ancien, passe venuste&#39;.&quot;
Such was the opinion of one who knew her well during her residence at the French court, when in attendance on Mary of England, consort of Louis XII., and afterwards Duchess of Suffolk.
&quot;I fear me you will fatigue yourself, Sir Thomas Wyat,&quot; said Anne Boleyn, in tones of musical sweetness, which made the heart beat and the colour mount to the cheeks of him she addressed.
&quot;I love all chivalrous exploits, and will do my best to encourage them.&quot;
This fair creature was the Lady Elizabeth Fitzgerald, daughter of Gerald Fitzgerald, ninth Earl of Kildare, who claimed descent from the Geraldi family of Florence; but she was generally known by the appellation of the Fair Geraldine--a title bestowed upon her, on account of her beauty, by the king, and by which she still lives, and will continue to live, as long as poetry endures, in the deathless and enchanting strains of her lover, the Earl of Surrey.
Her uneasiness, however, was in some degree abated by the knowledge, which as confidante of the latter she had obtained, that her brother was master of her heart.
&quot;If I were to meet him, and he offered me my heart&#39;s dearest wish, I fear he would prevail with me,&quot; observed the duke, glancing tenderly at the Fair Geraldine.
In this way they reached Windsor; and as Anne Boleyn gazed up at the lordly castle above which the royal standard now floated, proud and aspiring thoughts swelled her heart, and she longed for the hour when she should approach it as its mistress.
Just then her eye chanced on Sir Thomas Wyat, who was riding behind her amongst the knights, and she felt, though it might cost her a struggle, that love would yield to ambition.
Farewell for a short while, sweetheart.
&quot;My lords,&quot; he said, &quot;ye are right well aware of the scruples of conscience I entertain in regard to my marriage with my brother&#39;s widow, Catherine of Arragon.
And if I could divest myself of my misgivings, so far from seeking to put her from me, I should cherish her with the greatest tenderness.
What would befall this realm if my marriage were called in question after my decease?
&quot;Your majesty is too generous,&quot; replied Anne, bending the knee, and kissing his hand.
&quot;Not a whit, sweetheart--not a whit,&quot; replied Henry, tenderly raising her; &quot;this is but a slight mark of my goodwill.
Bowing reverently to the sovereign, Rochford, in a brief speech, expressed his gratitude for the signal honour conferred upon him, and at its close set his left foot upon a gilt stool, placed for him by the Garter, who pronounced the following admonition:--&quot;My good lord, the loving company of the Order of the Garter have received you as their brother and fellow.
He found her walking with her dames on the stately terrace at the north of the castle, and the attendants retiring as he joined her, he was left at full liberty for amorous converse.
Matins then commenced, and at the appointed part of the service the dean of the college took a silver box, containing the heart of Saint George, bestowed upon King Henry the Fifth by the Emperor Sigismund, and after incense had been shed upon it by one of the canons, presented it to the king and the knights-companions to kiss.
Taking heart, they then descended to the haunted tree, but could perceive no traces of the strange being by whom it had been recently tenanted.
&quot;I will never past with it but with life,&quot; he cried, pressing the cross to his lips, and afterwards placing it next his heart.
&quot;Young as he is, he loves well and truly,&quot; remarked Wyat, in a sombre tone.
inquired the Fair Geraldine, who had been gazing through the casement into the court below.
&quot;It matters little who may be his rival,&quot; rejoined Geraldine, &quot;provided she he loves be constant.&quot;
Anne Boleyn had summoned Sir Thomas Wyat, in order to gratify her vanity by showing him the unbounded influence she possessed over his royal rival; and the half-suppressed agony displayed by the unfortunate lover at the exhibition afforded her a pleasure such as only the most refined coquette can feel.
Soon afterwards the Lady Anne and her dames retired, and the court breaking up, the two young nobles strolled forth to the stately terrace at the north of the castle, where, while gazing at the glorious view it commanded, they talked over the mysterious event of the previous night.
The two friends, as if by mutual consent, avoided each other during the rest of the day--Surrey feeling he could not unburden his heart to Richmond, and Richmond brooding jealously over the intelligence he had received from the jester.
If, when a few more years have flown over your head, your heart remains unchanged.&quot;
&quot;Ay, marry is she,&quot; rejoined the first speaker; &quot;and, to my thinking, she is a fairer and sweeter flower than any that blooms in yon stately castle--the flower that finds so much favour in the eyes of our royal Hal not excepted.&quot;
&quot;Hal may marry her when he will, and divorce her as soon afterwards as he pleases, for aught I care.
If he marries fifty wives, I shall like him all the better.
But if he sets eyes on Mab Lyndwood it may somewhat unsettle his love for the Lady Anne.&quot;
&quot;What business have you to insinuate that the king would heed other than the lady of his love?&quot;
&quot;We all know you are in love with Mabel yourself.&quot;
&quot;That were a needless labour,&quot; rejoined Henry, &quot;seeing that you have already stricken me to the heart.
By the management of the keepers, the animal was driven past the royal stand; and Anne Boleyn, who had drawn an arrow nearly to the head, let it fly with such good aim that she pierced the buck to the heart.
&quot;Not so--not so, sweetheart,&quot; he replied hastily.
An ardent lover of hunting, the king watched it with the deepest interest, rose in his saddle, and uttering various exclamations, showed, from his impatience, that he was only restrained by the stronger passion of love from joining it.
I trust Wyat will be banished from court.
&quot;He loved me very dearly.&quot;
&quot;But what is his love compared to the king&#39;s?&quot;
you cannot love me, or you would not have done this.&quot;
&quot;Not love you, Anne!&quot;
he repeated bitterly; &quot;not love you I Words cannot speak my devotion.
But for my love for you, I would throw open that door, and walk forth so that all might see me--so that Henry might experience some part of the anguish I now feel.&quot;
&quot;Have no fear,&quot; rejoined Wyat, with some contempt; &quot;I will sacrifice even vengeance to love.&quot;
I shall at least wring Henry&#39;s heart.
Are you not about to give yourself to one to whom--unless you are foresworn--you cannot give your heart?
Then you will think of the different fate that might have been yours if you had adhered to your early love.&quot;
&quot;Wyat,&quot; cried Anne, throwing herself on her knees before him, &quot;by your former love for me, I implore you to spare me!
if you move not, I will stab you to the heart!&quot;
I yield to love, and not to you, tyrant!&quot;
&quot;May the worst pangs of jealously rend your heart!&quot;
Richmond, you will think no more of the fair Geraldine; and it is my pleasure, Lady Anne, that the young dame withdraw from the court for a short while.&quot;
&quot;Your majesty shall be obeyed,&quot; said Anne; &quot;but--&quot; &quot;But me no buts, sweetheart,&quot; said the king peremptorily.
&quot;Why, ay, sweetheart, well enough,&quot; rejoined Henry.
&quot;Sir Thomas Wyat, we have a special mission for you to the court of our brother of France.
Conscious of the advantage she had gained, she determined not to relinquish it, and, after half an hour&#39;s vain suing, her royal lover proposed a turn in the long gallery, upon which her apartments opened.
&quot;I would fain do so, sweetheart,&quot; rejoined Henry; &quot;but these cardinals perplex me sorely.&quot;
The warmth of my affection will grow icy cold by that time.&quot;
And now, sweetheart, are we entirely reconciled?
And now at last we are good friends, sweetheart.&quot;
On the day after his secret interview with Anne Boleyn, Sir Thomas Wyat received despatches from the king for the court of France.
&quot;All sentiments of love and loyalty are swallowed up by jealousy and burning hate.
&quot;I love her still, devotedly as ever.
While thus detained, he beheld Anne Boleyn and her royal lover mount their steeds in the upper ward, and ride forth, with their attendants, on a hawking expedition.
With increased bitterness of heart, he turned from the sight, and shrouded himself beneath the gateway of the Norman Tower.
Amid the distractions of the court I could find little leisure for the muse.&quot;
I speak from affection and duty.
I was serving-man to your father, good Sir Henry Wyat, before you, and I love you as a son, while I honour you as a master.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>It needed not Wyat&#39;s jealousy-sharpened gaze to read, even at that distance, the king&#39;s enamoured looks, or Anne Boleyn&#39;s responsive glances.
Henry bent forward, and Anne half averted her head, but not so much so as to prevent the king from imprinting a long and fervid kiss upon her lips.
When he recovered, Henry had bidden good-night to the object of his love, and, having nearly gained the door, turned and waved a tender valediction to her.
As soon as he was gone, Anne looked round with a smile of ineffable pride and pleasure at her attendants, but a cloud of curtains dropping over the window shrouded her from the sight of her wretched lover.
If a choice had been allowed him, he would have selected some high-born dame for the purpose; but as this was out of the question--and as, indeed, Henry had of late proved insensible to the attractions of all the beauties that crowded his court except Anne Boleyn--he trusted to the forester&#39;s fair granddaughter to accomplish his object.
Roused by the reflection, he quickened his pace, and shaping his course towards Black Nest, reached in a short time the borders of a wide swamp lying between the great lake and another pool of water of less extent situated in the heart of the forest.
&quot;On a love affair?&quot;
&quot;You dislike him strangely, Mab,&quot; rejoined her grandfather; &quot;he is the best keeper in the forest, and makes no secret of his love for you.&quot;
&quot;My grandsire says the king changes his love as often as the moon changes--nay, oftener.&quot;
&quot;And wherefore not, sweetheart?&quot;
&quot;You hear what my friend says, sweetheart,&quot; observed Harry; &quot;and I assure you he has the best opportunities of judging.
&quot;I have no fear of any such, sweetheart,&quot; replied Harry.
And as to evil spirits, a kiss from you will shield me from all ill.&quot; And as he spoke, he drew her towards him, and clasping her in his arms, imprinted a score of rapid kisses on her lips.
&quot;Now summon your false love, Sir Thomas Wyat,&quot; he added, as his orders were obeyed, and the light was taken into one of the side passages, so that its gleam no longer fell upon the water.
I have only power over her when evil is predominant in her heart.
Here the chase continued with unabated ardour, until, reaching the banks of the Thames, the hart plunged into it, and suffered himself to be carried noiselessly down the current.
&quot;And do you seek her love?&quot;
I have heard that he loves one in secret, and I am therefore the more beholden to him for discovering Mabel to me.&quot;
&quot;Thank Heaven, too, sweetheart!&quot;
you turn a compliment as soothly as the most practised dame at court,&quot; cried Henry, catching her hand.
Before you quitted my grandsire&#39;s cottage I told you this part of the forest was haunted by plunderers and evil beings, and apprehensive lest some mischance might befall you, I opened the window softly to look after you--&quot; &quot;And you overheard me tell the Duke of Suffolk how much smitten I was with your beauty, ha?&quot;
sweetheart?&quot;
&quot;And now, sweetheart,&quot; said Henry, turning to Mabel, &quot;since you are so far on the way, you shall go with me to the castle.&quot;
The king&#39;s highness is determined to make a fearful example of you and all your companions in crime; but he does not seek to destroy your soul, and has therefore sent this holy man to you, with the desire that you may open your heart to him, and by confession and repentance save yourself from eternal perdition.&quot;
&quot;Yea, marry, but he has escaped,&quot; rejoined Henry; &quot;and he has had the audacity to show himself in the castle within this hour, and the cunning, moreover, to set the prisoner free.&quot;
But if the antique tale is now worn out, and no longer part of our faith, it is pleasant at least to record it, and surrendering ourselves for a while to the sway of fancy, to conjure up the old enchanted castle on the hill, to people its courts with warlike and lovely forms, its forests with fays and giants.
A curious account of his frantic demeanour, after divesting himself of so much power and extending so greatly the liberties of the subject, is given by Holinshed:--&quot;Having acted so far contrary to his mind, the king was right sorrowful in heart, cursed his mother that bare him, and the hour in which he was born; wishing that he had received death by violence of sword or knife instead of natural nourishment.
He whetted his teeth, and did bite now on one staff, now on another, as he walked, and oft brake the same in pieces when he had done, and with such disordered behaviour and furious gestures he uttered his grief, that the noblemen very well perceived the inclination of his inward affection concerning these things before the breaking-up of the council, and therefore sore lamented the state of the realm, guessing what would follow of his impatience, and displeasant taking of the matter.&quot;
In 1223 eight hundred marks were paid to Engelhard de Cygony, constable of the castle, John le Draper, and William the clerk of Windsor, masters of the works, and others, for repairs and works within the castle; the latter, it is conjectured, referring to the erection of a new great hall within the lower ward, there being already a hall of small dimensions in the upper court.
But the popular legend, to which, despite the doubts thrown upon it, credence still attaches, declares its origin to be as follows: Joan, Countess of Salisbury, a beautiful dame, of whom Edward was enamoured, while dancing at a high festival accidentally slipped her garter, of blue embroidered velvet.
Richard the Second, grandson of Edward the Third, frequently kept his court at Windsor.
James&#39;s captivity, and his love for Jane of Beaufort, daughter of the Duke of Somerset, and granddaughter to John of Gaunt, to whom he was united, have breathed a charm over the Round Tower, where he was confined; and his memory, like that of the chivalrous and poetical Surrey, whom he resembled in character and accomplishments, will be ever associated with it.
And he thus describes the first appearance of the lovely Jane, and the effect produced upon him by her charms: &quot;And therewith cast I down mine eye again, Where as I saw walking under the tower, Full secretly, new comyn her to plain, The fairest and the freshest younge flower That e&#39;er I saw, methought, before that hour; For which sudden abate, anon did start The blood of all my body to my heart.&quot;
Henry the Fifth occasionally kept his court at Windsor, and in 1416 entertained with great magnificence the Emperor Sigismund, who brought with him an invaluable relic--the heart of Saint George--which he bestowed upon the chapter.
The zeal and assiduity with which Beauchamp prosecuted his task is adverted to in the patent of his appointment to the office of chancellor of the Garter, the preamble whereof recites, &quot;that out of mere love towards the Order, he had given himself the leisure daily to attend the advancement and progress of this goodly fabric.&quot;
At the lower end of the court, adjoining the canons&#39; houses behind the Horse-shoe Cloisters, stands the Collegiate Library, the date of which is uncertain, though it may perhaps be referred to this period.
In the middle of the court was erected a magnificent fountain, consisting of a canopy raised upon columns, gorgeously decorated with heraldic ornaments, and surmounted by a great vane, with the arms of Philip and Mary impaled upon it, and supported by a lion and an eagle, gilt and painted.
Mary held her court at Windsor soon after her union with Philip of Spain.
And to her admiration of the character of Falstaff, and her love of the locality, the world is indebted for the &quot;Merry Wives of Windsor.&quot;
The terrace, with its festive groups, resembled a picture by Watteau, the courts resounded with laughter, and the velvet sod of the home park was as often pressed by the foot of frolic beauty as by that of the tripping deer.
It now stands at the lower end of the same court.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Around the south and east sides of the court at which you are gazing, a spacious corridor has been constructed, five hundred and fifty feet in length, and connected with the different suites of apartments on these sides of the quadrangle; extensive alterations have been made in the domestic offices; the state apartments have been repaired and rearranged; Saint George&#39;s Hall has been enlarged by the addition of the private chapel (the only questionable change), and restored to the Gothic style; and the Waterloo Chamber built to contain George the Fourth&#39;s munificent gift to the nation of the splendid collection of portraits now occupying it.
This accomplished, Crane&#39;s ugly buildings removed, and the three western towers laid open to the court, the Horse-shoe Cloisters consistently repaired, Windsor Castle would indeed be complete.
IT was now the joyous month of June; and where is June so joyous as within the courts and halls of peerless Windsor?
There stands the castle, dating back as far as the Conquest, and boasting since its foundation a succession of royal inmates, while at its foot lies a region of unequalled fertility and beauty-full of happy homes, and loving, loyal hearts--a miniature of the old country and its inhabitants.
A joyous stir was within its courts--the gleam of arms and the fluttering of banners was seen upon its battlements and towers, and the ringing of bells, the beating of drums, and the fanfares of trumpets, mingled with the shouting of crowds and the discharge of ordnance.
In spite of his stubborn and tyrannical nature, Henry was a popular monarch, and never showed himself before his subjects but he gained their applauses; his love of pomp, his handsome person, and manly deportment, always winning him homage from the multitude.
A court was appointed by the legates to be holden on the 18th of June, at Blackfriars, to try the question.
Whatever secret feelings might be entertained against him, Henry was received by the inhabitants of Windsor with every demonstration of loyalty and affection.
cried the queen, covering his hand with kisses.
&quot;I am indeed your own true Kate--your faithful, loving, lawful wife!&quot;
&quot;I obey you now as I have ever done,&quot; she replied, rising; &quot;though if I followed the prompting of my heart, I should not quit my knees till I had gained my suit.&quot;
&quot;I do not reproach you, Henry,&quot; replied Catherine meekly, &quot;I only wish to show you the depth and extent of my affection.
&quot;No, my dear liege, not a hundredth part of what my heart prompts me to utter,&quot; replied Catherine.
&quot;I conjure you by my strong and tried affection--by the tenderness that has for years subsisted between us--by your hopes of temporal prosperity and spiritual welfare--by all you hold dear and sacred--to pause while there is yet time.
Let the legates meet to-morrow--let them pronounce sentence against me and as surely as those fatal words are uttered, my heart will break.&quot;
&quot;Not yet, Henry--for the love of Heaven, not yet!&quot;
&quot;Farewell, Henry--farewell, loved husband of my heart--farewell for ever!&quot;
I fear I have interrupted some amorous conference.&quot;
&quot;Not till I learn who your lady--love is,&quot; replied Anne pettishly.
&quot;You are distraught, sweetheart,&quot; cried the king.
Question your sister Mary, somewhile consort to Louis the Twelfth and now Duchess of Suffolk--question her as to the character and conduct of Anne Boleyn when she was her attendant at the court of France--ask whether she had never to reprove her for levity--question the Lord Percy as to her love for him--question Sir Thomas Wyat, and a host of others.&quot;
&quot;Oh no, I swear to you there is not,&quot; said Anne--&quot;I have trifled with the gallants of Francis&#39;s court, and have listened, perhaps too complacently, to the love-vows of Percy and Wyat, but when your majesty deigned to cast eyes upon me, all others vanished as the stars of night before the rising of the god of day.
Henry, I love you deeply, devotedly--but Catherine&#39;s terrible imprecations make me feel more keenly than I have ever done before the extent of the wrong I am about to inflict upon her--and I fear that retributive punishment will follow it.&quot;
&quot;I love you too well not to risk body and soul for you.
&quot;What ails you, sweetheart?&quot;
I love only you and can love only you.
&quot;I believe you, sweetheart,&quot; replied the king tenderly.
Ever ready to court danger, and convinced, from the intense gloom without, that a fearful storm was coming on, Henry resolved to go forth to witness it.
Your wrath shall descend upon the heads of those who love you, and your love shall be fatal.
When she awoke, the day was far advanced, but still old Tristram had not returned; and with a heavy heart she set about her household concerns.
&quot;No wonder the king is smitten with her,&quot; said Launcelot Rutter, the bladesmith; &quot;her eyes shine like a dagger&#39;s point.&quot;
&quot;What shall it be, sweetheart?
&quot;Nay, that is against all rule, sweetheart,&quot; said Deborah; &quot;no one enters the king&#39;s kitchen without tasting his royal cheer.&quot;
They are much attached to the cook, their master; but their chief love is towards each other, and nothing can keep them apart.&quot;
It would have done your heart good to witness their meeting, and to see how they leaped and rolled with delight.
While Mabel was admiring this display of sagacity and affection a bustling step was heard behind her, and turning, she beheld a strange figure in a parti-coloured gown and hose, with a fool&#39;s cap and bells on his head, whom she immediately recognised as the cardinal&#39;s jester, Patch.
&quot;I thought you were in attendance upon your master, at the court at Blackfriars.&quot;
&quot;Here&#39;s to you, fair maiden,&quot; he added, kissing the cup to Mabel, and swallowing its contents at a draught.
The court is adjourned for three days, Queen Catherine having demanded that time to prepare her allegations, and the delay has been granted her.&quot;
Mabel&#39;s heart fluttered violently at the usher&#39;s announcement, and for a moment the colour deserted her cheek, while the next instant she was covered with blushes.
As to poor Patch, feeling that his indiscretion might place him in great jeopardy and seriously affect his master, to whom he was devotedly attached, he cast a piteous and imploring look at his antagonist, but was answered only by a derisive laugh, coupled with an expressive gesture to intimate that a halter would be his fate.
The intelligence brought by Wolsey of the adjournment of the court for three days, under the plea of giving the queen time for her allegations, was so unlooked for by Henry that he quitted the cardinal in high displeasure, and was about to repair to Anne Boleyn, when he encountered Bouchier, who told him that Mabel Lyndwood had been brought to the castle, and her grandsire arrested.
&quot;Ah, Hob and Nob, my merry rascals,&quot; he cried, patting the turnspits, who ran towards him and thrust their noses against his hand, &quot;ye are as gamesome and loving as ever, I see.
&quot;Be of good cheer, sweetheart,&quot; she said, in a soothing tone; &quot;no harm will befall your grandfather.
&quot;I am glad you are to be an attendant on the Lady Fitzgerald,&quot; pursued Deborah, &quot;for she is the fairest young lady at court, and as good and gentle as she is fair, and I am sure you will find her a kind mistress.
She is beloved by the king&#39;s son, the Duke of Richmond, but she requites not his passion, for her heart is fixed on the youthful Earl of Surrey.
Have you ever seen Sir Thomas, sweetheart?&quot;
He was a former suitor to the Lady Anne Boleyn, and desperately in love with her; and it is supposed that his mission to France was only a pretext to get him out of the way.&quot;
for Mabel Lyndwood, if she allows her heart to be fixed upon the king,&quot; said Deborah.
&quot;&#39;Not so, I trust, good fellow,&#39; replied the king, in a tone meant to be encouraging, though his looks showed that his heart misgave him; &#39;my best leech shall attend you.&#39;
&quot;You look somewhat fatigued, sweetheart,&quot; said Deborah, observing Mabel&#39;s uneasiness.
Viewed from a recess which has been partly closed, the appearance of this chamber is equally picturesque and singular; and it is scarcely possible to pass beneath its huge beams or to gaze at the fantastic yet striking combinations they form in connection with the deep embrasures, the steep staircases and trap-doors, and not feel that the whole place belongs to romance, and that a multitude of strange and startling stories must be connected with it.
Your infatuation blinds you to the terrible consequences of the step.
I love her too well for that.
&quot;I have overheard what has passed; and from my heart of hearts I thank you, Henry, for the love you have displayed for me.
&quot;By my faith, I believe you are right, sweetheart,&quot; said the king.
&quot;Go, tell your allies, Francis and Clement, that the king&#39;s love for me outweighs his fear of them,&quot; cried Anne, laughing spitefully.
&quot;He will have one who can love him and hate his foes,&quot; replied Anne; &quot;and not one who would side with them and thee, as would be the case with the Duchess d&#39;Alencon or the Princess Renee.
Anne Boleyn remained with her royal lover for a few minutes to pour forth her gratitude for the attachment he had displayed to her, and to confirm the advantage she had gained over Wolsey.
&quot;In the one she vows eternal constancy to Sir Thomas Wyat, and in the other--written after her engagement to you--he tells him that though they can never meet as heretofore, she will always love him.&quot;
I will never love again.
Harkee, Suffolk, you are my brother, my second self, and know all the secrets of my heart.
cried Henry; &quot;says she shall ever love him--says so at the time she professes devoted love for me!
Suffolk, I feel she does not love me exclusively; and my passion is so deep and devouring, that it demands entire return.
I must have her heart as well as her person; and I feel I have only won her in my quality of king.&quot;
But between the depths of love and hate is but a step; and I can pass from one to the other.&quot;
Yielding to her entreaties not to see Catherine again, nor to hold further conference with Wolsey until the sentence of the court should be pronounced, Henry left the castle that very day, and proceeded to his palace of Bridewell.
Distrusting Wolsey, and putting her sole reliance on Heaven and the goodness of her cause, she withdrew to Blackfriars, where she remained till the court met.
Thus matters continued till the court met as before in the Parliament-chamber, at Blackfriars.
The proceedings of the court then commenced, and the king being called by the crier, he immediately answered to the summons.
Catherine was next called, and instead of replying, she marched towards the canopy beneath which the king was seated, prostrated herself, and poured forth a most pathetic and eloquent appeal to him, at the close of which she arose, and making a profound reverence, walked out of the court, leaning upon the arm of her general receiver, Griffith.
Some further discourse then took place between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Rochester; but as the queen had absented herself, the court was adjourned to the next day, when it again met, and as she did not then appear, though summoned, she was pronounced contumacious.
After repeated adjournments, the last session was held, and judgment demanded on the part of the king, when Campeggio, as had been arranged between him and Wolsey, declined to pronounce it until he had referred the matter to the Pope, and the court was dissolved.
About two months after this event, during which time the legate&#39;s commission had been revoked, while Henry was revolving the expediency of accomplishing the divorce through the medium of his own ecclesiastical courts, and without reference to that of Rome, a despatch was received from the Pope by the two cardinals, requiring them to cite the king to appear before him by attorney on a certain day.
At the time of the arrival of this instrument, Campeggio chanced to be staying with Wolsey at his palace at Esher, and as the king was then holding his court at Windsor, they both set out for the castle on the following day, attended by a retinue of nearly a hundred horsemen, splendidly equipped.
&quot;It is a citation,&quot; replied Wolsey, &quot;enjoining your high ness to appear by attorney in the papal court, under a penalty of ten thousand ducats.&quot;
&quot;Then it has been your practice to receive all the ambassadors to our court first at your own palace,&quot; continued Henry, &quot;to hear their charges and intentions, and to instruct them as you might see fit.
&quot;You have misdemeaned yourself in our court by keeping up as great state in our absence as if we had been there in person, and presumptuously have dared to join and imprint your badge, the cardinal&#39;s hat, under our arms, graven on our coins struck at York.
And, seating himself, he turned to Anne, and said, in a low tone, &quot;Are you content, sweetheart?&quot;
The broad and beautiful meads, stretching out beneath him, seemed to invite a ramble over them; the silver river courted a plunge into its waves, the woods an hour&#39;s retirement into their shady recesses, The bells of Eton College rang out merrily, but their sound saddened rather than elated him.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Here, as has been mentioned, King James the First of Scotland first beheld, from the battlements above, the lovely Jane Beaufort take her solitary walk, and by his looks and gestures contrived to make her sensible of the passion with which she inspired him; and here at last, in an arbour which, for the sake of the old and delightful legend connected with it, was kept up at the time of this chronicle, and then bore the name of the royal poet, they had secretly met, and interchanged their vows of affection.
This billet was read and re-read by the young earl with feelings of indescribable transport; but a little reflection damped his ardour, and made him fear it might be a device to ensnare him.
Still, despite these misgivings, the attraction was too powerful to be resisted, and he turned over the means of getting out of his chamber, but the scheme seemed wholly impracticable.
The king, through the Lady Anne Boleyn, has positively enjoined me to think no more of you and has given your father, the Duke of Norfolk, to understand that your marriage without the royal assent will be attended by the loss of all the favour he now enjoys.&quot;
This conviction, which has lately forced itself upon my mind, has not made me love you less, though it has in some degree altered my feelings towards you.&quot;
That your heart is bound to me now, I well believe--and that you could become inconstant I will not permit myself to suppose.
But your youth forbids an union between us for many years; and if during that time you should behold some fairer face than mine, or should meet some heart you may conceive more loving--though that can hardly be--I would not have a hasty vow restrain you.
sweet Geraldine, since we have met in this spot, hallowed by the loves of James of Scotland and Jane Beaufort, let us here renew our vows of eternal constancy, and agree to meet again at the time you have appointed, with hearts as warm and loving as those we bring together now.&quot;
And as he spoke he drew her towards him, and imprinted a passionate kiss on her lips.
&quot;Richmond,&quot; said Surrey sternly, &quot;we once were dear and loving friends, and we are still honourable foes.
I have already told your grace I cannot love you, and that my heart is devoted to the Earl of Surrey.
&quot;I repeat, you will wed another--and more, I tell you, you are blinder than Richmond has shown himself--for the most illustrious damsel in the kingdom has regarded you with eyes of affection, and yet you have not perceived it.&quot;
&quot;How say you now, my lord?--will you let ambition usurp the place of love?&quot;
Ever since the night on which he had been told the Lady Mary was not indifferent to him, Richmond had devoted himself entirely to her; and matters had already proceeded so far, that he had asked her in marriage of the Duke of Norfolk, who, after ascertaining the king&#39;s pleasure on the subject, had gladly given his consent, and the youthful pair were affianced to each other.
Surrey and Richmond now became closer friends than ever; and if, amid the thousand distractions of Henry&#39;s gay and festive court, the young earl did not forget the Fair Geraldine, he did not, at least, find the time hang heavily on his hands.
About a week after Wolsey&#39;s dismissal, while the court was still sojourning at Windsor, Surrey proposed to Richmond to ride one morning with him in the great park.
When these were over, Surrey expressed his surprise to Wyat at seeing him there, declaring he was wholly unaware of his return from the court of France.
&quot;His majesty supposes me at Allington; nor shall I return to court without a summons.&quot;
&quot;Then indeed you must fly,&quot; cried Wyat; &quot;such unhallowed love will tend to perdition of soul and body.&quot;
&quot;I will protect you--will care for you--will love you.&quot;
&quot;You love another.&quot;
&quot;Absence has enabled me to overcome the vehemence of my passion,&quot; replied Wyat, &quot;and I feel that my heart is susceptible of new emotions.
&quot;My love, like yours, is past,&quot; she answered, with a faint smile; &quot;but if I were out of Herne&#39;s power I feel that I could love again, and far more deeply than I loved before--for that, in fact, was rather the result of vanity than of real regard.&quot;
&quot;Mabel,&quot; said Wyat, taking her hand, and gazing into her eyes, &quot;if I set you free, will you love me?&quot;
&quot;I love you already,&quot; she replied; &quot;but if that could be, my whole life should be devoted to you.
&quot;And he has told you he loves you, and has urged you to fly with him--ha?&quot;
I have already told you that I love you, and am resolved to make you mine.
And from me, whom all fear, and all obey, you shall have love and worship.&quot;
&quot;Though I now inspire you with terror and aversion,&quot; pursued &quot;the time will come when you will love me as passionately as I was beloved by one of whom you are the image.&quot;
&quot;She I loved became mine.
At last, I saw the image of her I loved again appear before me, and the old passion was revived within my breast.
I love you, and would win you rather by persuasion than by force.
&quot;No,&quot; replied Wyat, &quot;I have purged my heart from the fierce and unhallowed passion that swayed it.
When the first flash was seen the demon had checked his steed and backed him, so that he had escaped without injury, and he stood at the edge of the flaming circle watching the progress of the devastating element; but at last, finding that his pursuers had taken heart and were approaching him, he bestirred himself, and rode round the blazing zone.
he cried, in a despairing voice, removing the dank tresses from her brow, and imprinting a reverent kiss upon it.
But the king was still averse to the match, and forbade the Fair Geraldine to return to court.
In her letters, she assured him that her love had undergone no abatement--and never would do so--but that she felt they must give up all idea of an union.
He became moody and discontented; took little share in the amusement and pastimes going forward; and from being the blithest cavalier at court, became the saddest.
At last, however, by the instrumentality of the queen and his father, he was contracted to the Lady Frances Vere, daughter of the Earl of Oxford, and was married to her in 1535.
Though Anne had never truly loved her royal consort, and though at that very time she was secretly encouraging the regards of another, she felt troubled by this change, and watched all the king&#39;s movements with jealous anxiety, to ascertain if any one had supplanted her in his affections.
Tall, exquisitely proportioned, with a complexion of the utmost brilliancy and delicacy, large liquid blue eyes, bright chestnut tresses, and lovely features, she possessed charms that could not fall to captivate the amorous monarch.
when a man loves deeply, as he loves me, due restraint is seldom maintained.&quot;
Jane Seymour was absolute mistress of his heart; and Anne was now as great a bar to him as she had before been an attraction.
Things were in this state when the court proceeded to Windsor, as before related, on Saint George&#39;s day.
&quot;If I may not utter my love I shall go mad,&quot; replied Norris.
My love and allegiance are due to the king.&quot;
&quot;Your majesty is determined to expose my blushes,&quot; said Jane Seymour, slightly struggling with her royal lover.
&quot;Nay, I only want to be satisfied that it is really yourself, sweetheart,&quot; cried Henry passionately.
No charms ever moved my heart like yours; nor shall I know a moment&#39;s peace till you become mine.&quot;
&quot;That is as much as to say,&quot; pursued Jane, seeing the gloomy reverie into which her royal lover was thrown, &quot;I can give your majesty no hopes at all.&quot;
&quot;You have been schooled by Anne Boleyn, sweetheart,&quot; said Henry.
&quot;I dare not listen to your majesty,&quot; said Jane Seymour, in a tremulous tone; &quot;and yet, if I dared speak--&quot; &quot;Speak on, fearlessly, sweetheart,&quot; said Henry.
&quot;Then I am well assured,&quot; said Jane, &quot;that the queen no longer loves you; nay, that she loves another.&quot;
Henry, my lord--my love--if you have any regard for me, instantly dismiss Jane Seymour.&quot;
There are those who would sacrifice a thousand lives, if they possessed them, for your love.&quot;
&quot;A woman&#39;s heart is a bauble which, when obtained, is speedily tossed aside.&quot;
My heart is not made of the same stuff as that of the royal Henry.
I can love deeply--devotedly--lastingly.&quot;
&quot;I would rather lose it than not be permitted to love you,&quot; he replied.
&quot;Nay, if that be so,&quot; cried Norris, &quot;and your majesty should be placed in peril on my account, I will banish myself from the court, and from your presence, whatever the effort cost me.&quot;
Let the certainty that I do love, content you, and seek not to tempt your fate further.&quot;
&quot;I envy not now the king, for I feel raised above him by your love.&quot;
&quot;I would rather you plunged your sword into my heart,&quot; said Norris.
&quot;Were it to be purchased by my soul&#39;s perdition, I would embrace it.&quot;
&quot;I mean this,&quot; he answered, regarding her with passionate earnestness: &quot;that you must love me now, for I have perilled my salvation for you.
Henry&#39;s attentions to Jane Seymour at the masqued fete were so marked, that the whole court was made aware of his passion.
Fly with me--fly with one who loves you, and will devote his whole life to you--who regards you, not as the queen, but as Anne Boleyn.
I feel that all you assert is true--that my present position is hazardous--that Jane Seymour is in the ascendant, while I am on the decline, if not wholly sunk--that you love me entirely, and would devote your life to me--still, with all these motives for dread, I cannot prevail upon myself voluntarily to give up my title, and to abandon my post to a rival.&quot;
&quot;You do not love me, then, as I love you, Anne,&quot; said Norris.
do you remember how you swore by your life--your crown--your faith--all that you held sacred or dear--that you would love me ever?&quot;
&quot;And so I would, if I could,&quot; replied the king; &quot;but unfortunately the heart is not entirely under control.
&quot;I have certainly suffered severely from your too evident regard for Jane Seymour; but, though deeply mortified and distressed, I have never for a moment been shaken in my love for your majesty.&quot;
&quot;A loyal and loving reply,&quot; said Henry.
&quot;I would fain believe so,&quot; said the king; &quot;but there are some persons who would persuade me that you have not only lost your affection for me, but have even cast eyes of regard on another.&quot;
&quot;Full well,&quot; replied Anne; &quot;and if love and duty would not restrain me, fear would.&quot;
The two wings were likewise richly decorated, and adorned with scutcheons and pennons, while from the battlements of the eastern side of the court were hung a couple of long flags.
Meanwhile, the crowd within the court was increased by a great influx of the different members of the household, amongst whom were Shoreditch, Paddington, and Hector Cutbeard.
The field being thus taken by the challengers, who retired to the upper end of the court, a trumpet was thrice sounded by a herald, and an answer was immediately made by another herald stationed opposite Henry the Seventh&#39;s buildings.
Having ridden round the court like the others, and addressed his salutation exclusively to Jane Seymour, Henry took his station with his companions near the base of the Round Tower, the summit of which was covered with spectators, as were the towers and battlements around.
Thus addressed, Henry raised his beaver, that he might see more distinctly, and beheld Norris take up the embroidered handkerchief, which he recognised as one that he had given, in the early days of his affection, to the queen.
Henry then called to the Earl of Surrey, the Marquis of Dorset, the Lord Clifford, Wyat, and some others, and bidding them attend him, prepared to quit the court.
Owing to the timely aid afforded her, she was speedily restored, and the first person her eyes fell upon was her lover.
At the sight of him a glance of affection illumined her features, but it was instantly changed into an expression of alarm.
that I had resisted Henry&#39;s love--his false vows--his fatal lures!
I have ever been a faithful and loyal consort to his highness, and though I may not have demeaned myself to him so humbly and gratefully as I ought to have done--seeing how much I owe him--yet I have lacked nothing in affection and duty.
I am sure I can move his heart, if I can only see him.&quot;
I may save my soul now; but if I embrace your offer I am lost for ever.&quot;
&quot;Norris will say, and with reason, that you love him not,&quot; cried Herne.
&quot;Then he will wrong me,&quot; replied Anne; &quot;for I do love him.
You may add, also, that not until my marriage is invalidated, Anne&#39;s offspring illegitimatised, and herself beheaded, shall I consider the foul blot upon my name removed.&quot;
&quot;I know your motives better; I know you have no proof of her guilt, and that in your heart of hearts you believe her innocent.
On the following day, she was summoned to the archiepiscopal palace at Lambeth, whither she was privately conveyed; and her marriage with the king was declared by Cranmer to be null and void, and to have always been so.
On the Tuesday before the execution, Jane Seymour retired to her father&#39;s mansion, Wolff Hall, in Wiltshire, where preparations were made for the marriage, which it was arranged should take place there in private on the Saturday.
I almost wish I was married myself, that I might try the experiment-ha!
And as he seems to delight in change of wives, I pray that he may have it to his heart&#39;s content.&quot;

the_merry_men_and_other_tales_and_fables

A boat had put me ashore the night before at Grisapol; I had such breakfast as the little inn afforded, and, leaving all my baggage till I had an occasion to come round for it by sea, struck right across the promontory with a cheerful heart.
But an uncle of mine, Gordon Darnaway, after a poor, rough youth, and some years at sea, had married a young wife in the islands; Mary Maclean she was called, the last of her family; and when she died in giving birth to a daughter, Aros, the sea-girt farm, had remained in his possession.
Thus it was that I came to spend my vacations in that part of the country, so far from all society and comfort, between the codfish and the moorcocks; and thus it was that now, when I had done with my classes, I was returning thither with so light a heart that July day.
The country people had many a story about Aros, as I used to hear from my uncle’s man, Rorie, an old servant of the Macleans, who had transferred his services without afterthought on the occasion of the marriage.
In view of the errand I had come upon to Aros, the feeling was baseless and unjust; but it burned high, at the first moment, in my heart.
He would have had a prood, prood heart that won ashore upon the back o’ that.” “And were all lost?” I cried.
For my part, I listened to him in a sort of trance, gazing with all my heart on that remembered scene, and drinking gladly the sea-air and the smoke of peats that had been lit by Mary.
The like is common in a thousand places on the coast; and many a boy must have amused himself as I did, seeking to read in them some reference to himself or those he loved.
I was perhaps a little disappointed at having lost so good an opportunity to declare my love; but I was at the same time far more deeply exercised at the change that had befallen my uncle.
It was impossible to close the eyes against one fact; that he had, as the saying goes, something on his mind; and as I mentally ran over the different words which might be represented by the letter M—misery, mercy, marriage, money, and the like—I was arrested with a sort of start by the word murder.
But there’s a hope that lies nearer to my heart than money.” And at that I paused.
Something in my heart distinctly told me that I should find the ship of the Armada; and although I did not give way entirely to such hopeful thoughts, I was still very light in spirits and walked upon air.
But when I remembered Mary, I took heart again.
My uncle would never consent to an imprudent marriage, nor would she, as I was persuaded, wed without his full approval.
But the strong sun upon my shoulders warmed me to the heart, and I stooped forward and plunged into the sea.
The sight of this poor human relic thrilled me to the heart, but not with hope nor fear, only with a desolate melancholy.
The thicket was alive with crabs and lobsters, trundling to and fro lopsidedly, and I had to harden my heart against the horror of their carrion neighbourhood.
I remember I had almost a sense of relief in my disappointment, and I was about ready to leave go, when something happened that sent me to the surface with my heart in my mouth.
But as soon as I trod the good earth again, and had covered my nakedness against the sun, I knelt down over against the ruins of the brig, and out of the fulness of my heart prayed long and passionately for all poor souls upon the sea.
God knows I am in no heart for laughing.
Do ye think I havenae broken my heart to have these braws (as he calls them, God forgive him!)
He sat still for a while, panting like a dog, after that; but his desire for the spoils of shipwreck triumphed once more over his fears; once more he tottered among the curded foam; once more he crawled upon the rocks among the bursting bubbles; once more his whole heart seemed to be set on driftwood, fit, if it was fit for anything, to throw upon the fire.
Forward and embrace it; welcome like a father yon creature who comes trembling to your mercy.” With that, I tried to force him towards the black; but he felled me to the ground, burst from my grasp, leaving the shoulder of his jacket, and fled up the hillside towards the top of Aros like a deer.
Respect came upon me and grew stronger, the more I observed him; I saw he had a powerful mind and a sober and severe character, such as I loved to commune with; and before we reached the house of Aros I had almost forgotten, and wholly forgiven him, his uncanny colour.
To Mary I told all that had passed without suppression, though I own my heart failed me; but I did wrong to doubt her sense of justice.
No one was there; Rorie and the black had both stealthily departed long before; and my heart stood still at the discovery.
I could rely on Rorie’s heart, but I placed no trust in his discretion.
Ay, it has a long trot before it as it goes singing over our weir, bless its heart!” “And what is the sea?” asked Will.
An over-mastering emotion seized upon the boy, soul and body; his heart beat so thickly that he could not breathe; the scene swam before his eyes; the sun seemed to wheel round and round, and throw off, as it turned, strange shapes which disappeared with the rapidity of thought, and were succeeded by others.
It did not matter what it was; everything that went that way, were it cloud or carriage, bird or brown water in the stream, he felt his heart flow out after it in an ecstasy of longing.
He was like some one lying in twilit, formless preexistence, and stretching out his hands lovingly towards many-coloured, many-sounding life.
They sat far into the night; and about two in the morning Will opened his heart to the young man, and told him how he longed to leave the valley and what bright hopes he had connected with the cities of the plain.
He soon began to take rank in the district as a bit of an oddity: it was not much to be wondered at from the first, for he was always full of notions, and kept calling the plainest common-sense in question; but what most raised the report upon him was the odd circumstance of his courtship with the parson’s Marjory.
She held her head very high, and had already refused several offers of marriage with a grand air, which had got her hard names among the neighbours.
Now, what with the inn, and the mill, and the old miller’s savings, our friend was a man of substance; and besides that, he had a name for good temper and shrewdness, which make a capital portion in marriage; and so it was currently gossiped, among their ill-wishers, that the parson and his daughter had not chosen their temporary lodging with their eyes shut.
Will was about the last man in the world to be cajoled or frightened into marriage.
It might be a question whether she was not Will’s match in stedfastness, after all, or which of them would rule the roost in marriage.
Many kind, simple, and sincere speeches found an echo in his heart.
It is the property of things seen for the first time, or for the first time after long, like the flowers in spring, to reawaken in us the sharp edge of sense and that impression of mystic strangeness which otherwise passes out of life with the coming of years; but the sight of a loved face is what renews a man’s character from the fountain upwards.
I am mostly a cold, unkindly sort of man; not from want of heart, but out of strangeness in my way of thinking; and people seem far away from me.
But for my part, as far as I can understand what people mean by it, I fancy I must be what they call in love.
“Here’s our neighbour who says he loves you, Madge.
Do you love him, ay or no?” “I think I do,” said Marjory, faintly.
“You must marry,” observed the parson, replacing his pipe in his mouth.
The sound of his own mill-wheel, or of the wind among the trees, confounded and charmed his heart.
“Indeed I love them dearly,” she replied.
“They are a deal better off where they are, and look a deal prettier, if you go to that.” “I wish to have them for my own,” she answered, “to carry them near my heart, and keep them in my room.
“I have been thinking about getting married,” he began abruptly; “and after having turned it all over, I have made up my mind it’s not worthwhile.” She turned upon him for a single moment; but his radiant, kindly appearance would, under the circumstances, have disconcerted an angel, and she looked down again upon the ground in silence.
As to whether I have ever loved you or not, I must leave that to others.
I do not think getting married is worth while.
But I’ll marry you if you will,” he added.
“Not I, Marjory,” said he; “if there is anything in a clear conscience, not I. I offer all my heart’s best affection; you can take it or want it, though I suspect it’s beyond either your power or mine to change what has once been done, and set me fancy-free.
I’ll marry you, if you like; but I tell you again and again, it’s not worth while, and we had best stay friends.
Trust in me, and take things as I propose; or, if you don’t like that, say the word, and I’ll marry you out of hand.” There was a considerable pause, and Will, who began to feel uneasy, began to grow angry in consequence.
Do you want me to marry you?
We see that we have each made a mistake about our feelings, and he has agreed, at my request, to give up all idea of marriage, and be no more than my very good friend, as in the past.
The former was, perhaps, the true thought of his heart, and represented the regular tenor of the man’s reflections; but the latter burst forth from time to time with an unruly violence, and then he would forget all consideration, and go up and down his house and garden or walk among the fir-woods like one who is beside himself with remorse.
As soon as he had taken his determination, he had regained at a bound his customary peace of heart, and he enjoyed the bright weather and the variety of the scene without any admixture of alarm or unpleasant eagerness.
If she accepted him he would have to marry her this time, which perhaps was, all for the best.
“I have been thinking about this marriage,” he began.
For nearly three years Will and Marjory continued on these terms, seeing each other once or twice a week without any word of love between them; and for all that time I believe Will was nearly as happy as a man can be.
Indeed there was one corner of the road, whence he could see the church-spire wedged into a crevice of the valley between sloping firwoods, with a triangular snatch of plain by way of background, which he greatly affected as a place to sit and moralise in before returning homewards; and the peasants got so much into the habit of finding him there in the twilight that they gave it the name of “Will o’ the Mill’s Corner.” At the end of the three years Marjory played him a sad trick by suddenly marrying somebody else.
Will kept his countenance bravely, and merely remarked that, for as little as he knew of women, he had acted very prudently in not marrying her himself three years before.
But at heart, he was reasonably displeased, moped a good deal for a month or two, and fell away in flesh, to the astonishment of his serving-lads.
It was perhaps a year after this marriage that Will was awakened late one night by the sound of a horse galloping on the road, followed by precipitate knocking at the inn-door.
His heart was young and vigorous; and if his pulses kept a sober time, they still beat strong and steady in his wrists.
Fifty years ago you would have brought my heart into my mouth; and now you do not even tempt me.
From the arbour to the gate was no great distance, and yet it took Will some time; it seemed as if the dead thickened around him in the court, and crossed his path at every step.
While he thus stood, and it seemed as if he must have stood there quite a long time, there came a renewal of the noises on the road: and he turned in time to meet a stranger, who was advancing to meet him across the court.
He stared and stared at this shadow, as he wiped out the glasses, and began to feel cold and strange about the heart.
“So am I,” continued the other; “and it is the delight of my heart to tramp on people’s corns.
The tones of his voice were dull and startling, and echoed strangely in Will’s heart.
I am caustic, and sometimes offend people at first sight; but I am a good friend at heart to such as you.” “Since Marjory was taken,” returned Will, “I declare before God you were the only friend I had to look for.” So the pair went arm-in-arm across the courtyard.
But the thing was neglected yesterday; I must produce my little compliment at dinner; and, as you very well know, a rich marriage is not a thing to be neglected.” There followed a pause, during which the dealer seemed to weigh this statement incredulously.
You are an old customer after all; and if, as you say, you have the chance of a good marriage, far be it from me to be an obstacle.
“But I see this is a love match of yours, and you have been drinking the lady’s health.” “Ah!” cried Markheim, with a strange curiosity.
“Ah, have you been in love?
“I in love!
Markheim, smitten into ice, glanced at the dead man.
So he reasoned in vain; he could rise to no more remorseful consciousness; the same heart which had shuddered before the painted effigies of crime, looked on its reality unmoved.
“I should warn you,” resumed the other, “that the maid has left her sweetheart earlier than usual and will soon be here.
I thought—since you exist—you would prove a reader of the heart.
My heart rises at the thought.
And it is not because you have killed a dealer, but because you are Markheim, that I offer to forward your escape.” “I will lay my heart open to you,” answered Markheim.
I become in all things a free actor in the world; I begin to see myself all changed, these hands the agents of good, this heart at peace.
I do not love the one thing, I love all.
I pity and help them; I prize love, I love honest laughter; there is no good thing nor true thing on earth but I love it from my heart.
My love of good is damned to barrenness; it may, and let it be!
It was before the days o’ the moderates—weary fa’ them; but ill things are like guid—they baith come bit by bit, a pickle at a time; and there were folk even then that said the Lord had left the college professors to their ain devices, an’ the lads that went to study wi’ them wad hae done mair and better sittin’ in a peat-bog, like their forbears of the persecution, wi’ a Bible under their oxter and a speerit o’ prayer in their heart.
But Mr. Soulis just blamed himsel’, he said, to think sae ill of a puir, auld afflicted wife that hadnae a freend forbye himsel’; an’ he put up a bit prayer for him and her, an’ drank a little caller water—for his heart rose again the meat—an’ gaed up to his naked bed in the gloaming.
An’ then a’ at aince, the minister’s heart played dunt an’ stood stock-still; an’ a cauld wund blew amang the hairs o’ his heid.
“God forgive us all!” thocht Mr. Soulis; “poor Janet’s dead.” He cam’ a step nearer to the corp; an’ then his heart fair whammled in his inside.
He couldnae pray, he couldnae think, he was dreepin’ wi’ caul’ swat, an’ naething could he hear but the dunt-dunt-duntin’ o’ his ain heart.
It’s a strange thing that the saul of man should be that thirled into his perishable body; but the minister saw that, an’ his heart didnae break.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Then, much of the fortune having died with him, and the family being quite extinct, the girl ran wilder than ever, until at last she married, Heaven knows whom, a muleteer some say, others a smuggler; while there are some who uphold there was no marriage at all, and that Felipe and Olalla are bastards.
“I would not romance, if I were you,” replied the doctor; “you will find, I fear, a very grovelling and commonplace reality.
No, no, senor commandante, you must seek congenial society among the great sights of our mountains; and in these at least, if you are at all a lover of the works of nature, I promise you will not be disappointed.” The next day Felipe came for me in a rough country cart, drawn by a mule; and a little before the stroke of noon, after I had said farewell to the doctor, the innkeeper, and different good souls who had befriended me during my sickness, we set forth out of the city by the Eastern gate, and began to ascend into the Sierra.
As the dusk increased, I fell more and more under the spell of this artless warbling, listening and waiting for some articulate air, and still disappointed; and when at last I asked him what it was he sang—“O,” cried he, “I am just singing!” Above all, I was taken with a trick he had of unweariedly repeating the same note at little intervals; it was not so monotonous as you would think, or, at least, not disagreeable; and it seemed to breathe a wonderful contentment with what is, such as we love to fancy in the attitude of trees, or the quiescence of a pool.
The peasant carried off the cart to some out-building; but my guide and I passed through the wicket, which was closed again behind us; and by the glimmer of the candle, passed through a court, up a stone stair, along a section of an open gallery, and up more stairs again, until we came at last to the door of a great and somewhat bare apartment.
The first light of the morning shone full upon the portrait, and, as I lay awake, my eyes continued to dwell upon it with growing complacency; its beauty crept about my heart insidiously, silencing my scruples one after another; and while I knew that to love such a woman were to sign and seal one’s own sentence of degeneration, I still knew that, if she were alive, I should love her.
He certainly liked me; he was proud of my notice, which he sought to engage by many simple and childlike devices; he loved to sit close before my fire, talking his broken talk or singing his odd, endless, wordless songs, and sometimes drawing his hand over my clothes with an affectionate manner of caressing that never failed to cause in me an embarrassment of which I was ashamed.
Little as he said to me, and that of not much import, I have rarely enjoyed more stirring company; the sight of his delight was a continual feast; the speed and accuracy of his movements pleased me to the heart; and I might have been so thoughtlessly unkind as to make a habit of these wants, had not chance prepared a very rude conclusion to my pleasure.
The sound stirred my sympathies, it was so fresh and innocent; but as I bettered my pace to draw near, the cry of the squirrel knocked upon my heart.
But he took the lesson in good part; and whether from that, or from what I had said to him, or the higher notion he now had of my bodily strength, his original affection was changed into a dog-like, adoring fidelity.
It enclosed an open court planted with pomegranate trees.
From this a broad flight of marble stairs ascended to an open gallery, running all round and resting, towards the court, on slender pillars.
The court, in particular, seemed the very home of slumber.
Though it was open in front upon the court, it was yet provided with a chimney, where a wood fire would he always prettily blazing; and the tile floor was littered with the skins of animals.
Now she would speak of the warmth, in which (like her son) she greatly delighted; now of the flowers of the pomegranate trees, and now of the white doves and long-winged swallows that fanned the air of the court.
I can scarce say she brightened when I came, for satisfaction was written on her face eternally, as on some foolish statue’s; but I was made conscious of her pleasure by some more intimate communication than the sight.
The thing was done, and she was back in her accustomed attitude, before my mind had received intelligence of the caress; and when I turned to look her in the face I could perceive no answerable sentiment.
The court had a forlorn appearance; now and then a glimmer of sun fled over it; now and then the wind swooped down upon the pomegranates, and scattered the blossoms, and set the window shutters clapping on the wall.
I began to long for some society, and stole down to the court.
I leaped from my bed, supposing I had dreamed; but the cries still continued to fill the house, cries of pain, I thought, but certainly of rage also, and so savage and discordant that they shocked the heart.
Long after that, I still lingered and still continued to hear them mingle in fancy with the storming of the wind; and when at last I crept to my bed, it was with a deadly sickness and a blackness of horror on my heart.
Felipe came to my bedside with obvious cheerfulness; as I passed through the court, the Senora was sunning herself with her accustomed immobility; and when I issued from the gateway, I found the whole face of nature austerely smiling, the heavens of a cold blue, and sown with great cloud islands, and the mountain-sides mapped forth into provinces of light and shadow.
God knows, my own heart most sharply punished me for my indiscretion.
I took his hand in mine, at which, thinking it to be a caress, he smiled with a brightness of pleasure that came near disarming my resolve.
Something in the stillness moved me to imitation, and I went very lightly across the court and up the marble staircase.
Surprise transfixed me; her loveliness struck to my heart; she glowed in the deep shadow of the gallery, a gem of colour; her eyes took hold upon mine and clung there, and bound us together like the joining of hands; and the moments we thus stood face to face, drinking each other in, were sacramental and the wedding of souls.
The thrill of her young life, strung like a wild animal’s, had entered into me; the force of soul that had looked out from her eyes and conquered mine, mantled about my heart and sprang to my lips in singing.
I could not doubt but that I loved her at first sight, and already with a quivering ardour that was strange to my experience.
And if I could not marry, what then?
She was helplessly unprotected; her eyes, in that single and long glance which had been all our intercourse, had confessed a weakness equal to my own; but in my heart I knew her for the student of the cold northern chamber, and the writer of the sorrowful lines; and this was a knowledge to disarm a brute.
I did not see her the next day, and my heart ached and my eyes longed for her, as men long for morning.
I would have spoken, I would have drawn near to her; but strongly as she plucked at my heart, drawing me like a magnet, something yet more imperious withheld me; and I could only bow and pass by; and she, leaving my salutation unanswered, only followed me with her noble eyes.
I had now her image by rote, and as I conned the traits in memory it seemed as if I read her very heart.
She was dressed with something of her mother’s coquetry, and love of positive colour.
I would not lose a chance, and loitered all afternoon in the court where (to give myself a countenance) I spoke more than usual with the Senora.
I was sure of myself, light of heart and foot, and resolved to put my love incontinently to the touch of knowledge.
It should lie no longer under the bonds of silence, a dumb thing, living by the eye only, like the love of beasts; but should now put on the spirit, and enter upon the joys of the complete human intimacy.
Words were denied me; if I advanced I could but clasp her to my heart in silence; and all that was sane in me, all that was still unconquered, revolted against the thought of such an accost.
So we stood for a second, all our life in our eyes, exchanging salvos of attraction and yet each resisting; and then, with a great effort of the will, and conscious at the same time of a sudden bitterness of disappointment, I turned and went away in the same silence.
Was this love?
or was it a mere brute attraction, mindless and inevitable, like that of the magnet for the steel?
It was not thus that I desired to be loved.
And at the coming of pity, all other thoughts were swallowed up; and I longed only to find and console and reassure her; to tell her how wholly her love was returned on my side, and how her choice, even if blindly made, was not unworthy.
My heart wept for the sight of Olalla, as a child weeps for its mother.
It was for this I had been waiting; this was the last test of my love.
It was not only a voice that spoke to my heart directly; but it spoke to me of her.
I know not in what words I answered; but, standing before her on the cliffs, I poured out the whole ardour of my love, telling her that I lived upon the thought of her, slept only to dream of her loveliness, and would gladly forswear my country, my language, and my friends, to live for ever by her side.
“Nature,” I told her, “was the voice of God, which men disobey at peril; and if we were thus humbly drawn together, ay, even as by a miracle of love, it must imply a divine fitness in our souls; we must be made,” I said—“made for one another.
Something elemental, something rude, violent, and savage, in the love that sang in my heart, was like a key to nature’s secrets; and the very stones that rattled under my feet appeared alive and friendly.
Love burned in me like rage; tenderness waxed fierce; I hated, I adored, I pitied, I revered her with ecstasy.
She sat there, all sloth and contentment, blinking under the strong sunshine, branded with a passive enjoyment, a creature set quite apart, before whom my ardour fell away like a thing ashamed.
It was not my heart, it was not my happiness, it was life itself that was involved.
They were not words that came to her, they were sounds more beautiful than speech, infinitely touching, infinitely tender; and yet as I lay there, a thought stung to my heart, a thought wounded me like a sword, a thought, like a worm in a flower, profaned the holiness of my love.
They were the death-cry of my love; my love was murdered; was not only dead, but an offence to me; and yet, think as I pleased, feel as I must, it still swelled within me like a storm of sweetness, and my heart melted at her looks and touch.
This horror that had sprung out, this doubt upon Olalla, this savage and bestial strain that ran not only through the whole behaviour of her family, but found a place in the very foundations and story of our love—though it appalled, though it shocked and sickened me, was yet not of power to break the knot of my infatuation.
To lie thus in deadly weakness and drink in the traits of the beloved, is to reawake to love from whatever shock of disillusion.
Late on in the night some strength revived in me, and I spoke:— “Olalla,” I said, “nothing matters; I ask nothing; I am content; I love you.” She knelt down awhile and prayed, and I devoutly respected her devotions.
I begged it of you, and I know you would have granted me even this; or if not, O let me think so!” “I love you,” I said.
So I shall have a life in the cherished places of your memory: a life as much my own, as that which I lead in this body.” “I love you,” I said once more; and reaching out my weak hand, took hers, and carried it to my lips, and kissed it.
And then it seemed she made a call upon her resolution; plucked my hand towards her, herself at the same time leaning somewhat forward, and laid it on the beating of her heart.
This capsule, such as throbs against the sides of animals, knows you at a touch for its master; ay, it loves you!
Yet when you spoke to me your words were of the soul; it is of the soul that you ask—it is only from the soul that you would take me.” “Olalla,” I said, “the soul and the body are one, and mostly so in love.
What the body chooses, the soul loves; where the body clings, the soul cleaves; body for body, soul to soul, they come together at God’s signal; and the lower part (if we can call aught low) is only the footstool and foundation of the highest.” “Have you,” she said, “seen the portraits in the house of my fathers?
If not a curve in this poor body of mine (which you love, and for the sake of which you dotingly dream that you love me) not a gesture that I can frame, not a tone of my voice, not any look from my eyes, no, not even now when I speak to him I love, but has belonged to others?
Is it me you love, friend?
Your hand clings to mine, your heart leaps at my touch, the unknown elements of which we are compounded awake and run together at a look; the clay of the earth remembers its independent life and yearns to join us; we are drawn together as the stars are turned about in space, or as the tides ebb and flow, by things older and greater than we ourselves.” “Alas!” she said, “what can I say to you?
The breath of weariness blew on their humanity and the cords relaxed; they began to go down; their minds fell on sleep, their passions awoke in gusts, heady and senseless like the wind in the gutters of the mountains; beauty was still handed down, but no longer the guiding wit nor the human heart; the seed passed on, it was wrapped in flesh, the flesh covered the bones, but they were the bones and the flesh of brutes, and their mind was as the mind of flies.
Think of me sometimes as one to whom the lesson of life was very harshly told, but who heard it with courage; as one who loved you indeed, but who hated herself so deeply that her love was hateful to her; as one who sent you away and yet would have longed to keep you for ever; who had no dearer hope than to forget you, and no greater fear than to be forgotten.” She had drawn towards the door as she spoke, her rich voice sounding softer and farther away; and with the last word she was gone, and I lay alone in the moonlit chamber.
I could not bear to have you think so; though, Heaven knows, it were, perhaps, better that you should.” At this, I raised myself in bed, and opened my heart to the old man; telling him of our love and of her decision, owning my own horrors, my own passing fancies, but telling him that these were at an end; and with something more than a purely formal submission, appealing to his judgment.
All men despise the savage notions of such peasantry; and yet I was conscious of a chill shadow that seemed to fall and dwell upon my love.
It did not conquer, but I may not deny that it restrained my ardour.
I passed whole days there, debating with myself the various elements of our position; now leaning to the suggestions of love, now giving an ear to prudence, and in the end halting irresolute between the two.
I took him by the arm, Senor, and dragged him to the gate; I conjured him, by all he loved and respected, to go forth with me; I went on my knees before him in the snow; and I could see he was moved by my entreaty.
A report has gone about the mountain; it is thought you love me, and the people will not suffer it.” I saw she was already informed of her danger, and I rejoiced at it.
“Olalla,” I said, “I am ready to go this day, this very hour, but not alone.” She stepped aside and knelt down before the crucifix to pray, and I stood by and looked now at her and now at the object of her adoration, now at the living figure of the penitent, and now at the ghastly, daubed countenance, the painted wounds, and the projected ribs of the image.
The inn was not thirty yards away, but the messenger did not stop there; he went in at one door and out by another into the court, and then led the way by a flight of steps beside the stable, to the loft where the mountebank lay sick.
And here, for instance, Doctor Desprez, a man past forty, who had made what is called a failure in life, and was moreover married, found himself at a new point of departure when he opened the door of the loft above Tentaillon’s stable.
The Doctor drew a long breath, he was so much relieved to find a theory (for he loved theories) and to explain away his interest.
“It is a fair consequence that I know more and wish to do less with my knowledge.” The Doctor was a connoisseur of sunrises, and loved a good theatrical effect to usher in the day.
Does it not please the heart?
The Doctor threw away his stick, bounded on the boy, clasped him to his bosom, and kissed him on both cheeks.
To live in that pleasant old house, with a green garden behind and bright flowers about the window, to eat and drink of the best, to gossip with a neighbour for a quarter of an hour, never to wear stays or a dress except when she went to Fontainebleau shopping, to be kept in a continual supply of racy novels, and to be married to Doctor Desprez and have no ground of jealousy, filled the cup of her nature to the brim.
So Doctor Desprez lived in his house like a fatted calf, warmed and cosseted to his heart’s content.
You married the animal side of my nature, dear and it is on the spiritual side that I find my affinity for Jean-Marie.
But on this point—” “My dear love,” interrupted the Doctor, eager to prevent a refusal, “who wished to leave Paris?
“You will break my heart,” she sighed.
On the other hand, you behold in me a man not old, though elderly, still enjoying the youth of the heart and the intelligence; a man of instruction; easily situated in this world’s affairs; keeping a good table:—a man, neither as friend nor host, to be despised.
“Will you kiss me, my pretty little fellow?” The Doctor was furious, and dragged her into the passage.
He must be spoken to with more respect, I tell you; he must not be kissed and Georgy-porgy’d like an ordinary child.” “I only did it to please you, I am sure,” replied Anastasie; “but I will try to do better.” The Doctor apologised for his warmth.
You will soon grow used to him, and then you will love him, for that nobody can help.
Will you give me a kiss?” He held up his face, and she took him in her arms and then began to cry.
In this way, she had little to do with Jean-Marie; but the sympathy which had been established between them on the first night remained unbroken; they held occasional conversations, mostly on household matters; to the extreme disappointment of the Doctor, they occasionally sallied off together to that temple of debasing superstition, the village church; madame and he, both in their Sunday’s best, drove twice a month to Fontainebleau and returned laden with purchases; and in short, although the Doctor still continued to regard them as irreconcilably anti-pathetic, their relation was as intimate, friendly, and confidential as their natures suffered.
I fear, however, that in her heart of hearts, madame kindly despised and pitied the boy.
Moreover, deep down in his heart the Doctor was disappointed with the ill-success of his more formal education.
To these he lovingly returned.
The nerves are harmonised and quieted; the mind attuned to silence; and observe how easily and regularly beats the heart!
There is a well in the court which sends up sparkling water from the earth’s very heart, clean, cool, and, with a little wine, most wholesome.
“Perhaps one of the reasons why I love my little hamlet as I do, is that we have a similar history, she and I.
Have I not good wine, good food, good air, the fields and the forest for my walk, a house, an admirable wife, a boy whom I protest I cherish like a son?
Already you perceive the consequences; the mind is stimulated, the heart steps to a different measure, and the man is himself no longer.
Should I return to Paris, I should ruin myself gambling; nay, I go further—I should break the heart of my Anastasie with infidelities.” This was too much for Jean-Marie.
There was never any one more vigorously determined to be pleased; and if he was not a great logician, and so had no right to convince the intellect, he was certainly something of a poet, and had a fascination to seduce the heart.
All the world imagine they will be exceptional when they grow wealthy; but possession is debasing, new desires spring up; and the silly taste for ostentation eats out the heart of pleasure.” “Then you might be better if you had less,” said the boy.
The Doctor thoroughly possessed his heart, but perhaps he exaggerated his influence over his mind.
I admire the writer of that letter from my heart; he was a man of thought on the most important subjects.
I saw a house in Paris with a court and garden, I saw my wife shining with diamonds, I saw myself a deputy, I saw you—well, I—I saw your future,” he concluded, rather feebly.
Thy name is graven in my heart.
Fresh opulence and a new sphere of duties find me unabated in ardour and only more mature by knowledge.
“See, here are the first fruits; a pineapple, a dress for my ever-beautiful—it will suit her—trust a husband’s, trust a lover’s, taste!
“I do not comprehend.” “The turtle, my adored, the turtle!” cried the doctor; and he pushed her towards the kitchen, lantern and all.
“Yours has been a tragic marriage!” “But your success—to see you appreciated, honoured, your name in all the papers, that will be more than pleasure—it will be heaven!” she cried.
He covered it with kisses.
Madame and Jean-Marie were summoned from their rooms, and appeared in hasty toilets; they found the Doctor raving, calling the heavens to witness and avenge his injury, pacing the room bare-footed, with the tails of his night-shirt flirting as he turned.
We have now arrived,” he resumed, “at some idea of the composition of the gang—for I incline to the hypothesis of more than one—and we now leave this room, which can disclose no more, and turn our attention to the court and garden.
No steps on the court; it is unfortunate our court should be paved.
Anastasie’s born brother, he did not waste much sentiment on the lady, gave her an English family kiss, and demanded a meal without delay.
But much would depend on the quality of the gold.” “The quality, my dear Casimir, was—” And the Doctor, in default of language, kissed his finger-tips.
At last, after he has sobbed his very heart out, he agrees to stay on a condition—we are not to mention this matter, this infamous suspicion, not even to mention the robbery.
As it was, the whole family loved it, and the Doctor was never better inspired than when he narrated its imaginary story and drew the character of its successive masters, from the Hebrew merchant who had re-edified its walls after the sack of the town, and past the mysterious engraver of the runes, down to the long-headed, dirty-handed boor from whom he had himself acquired it at a ruinous expense.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“Ruined,” he replied, “you are ruined by your sinister husband.” Casimir observed the consequent embrace through his eyeglass; then he turned to Jean-Marie.
It speaks a want of heart that disappoints me sorely.” “Want of manners,” corrected Casimir.

In the summer I often leave home early in the morning, and roam about fields and lanes all day, or even escape for days or weeks together; but, saving in the country, I seldom go out until after dark, though, Heaven be thanked, I love its light and feel the cheerfulness it sheds upon the earth, as much as any creature living.
I love these little people; and it is not a slight thing when they, who are so fresh from God, love us.
What if I had lost thee, Nell!’ ‘I would have found my way back to YOU, grandfather,’ said the child boldly; ‘never fear.’ The old man kissed her, then turning to me and begging me to walk in, I did so.
Why, who ever loved a child as I love Nell?’ He said this with such evident surprise that I was perplexed what answer to make, and the more so because coupled with something feeble and wandering in his manner, there were in his face marks of deep and anxious thought which convinced me that he could not be, as I had been at first inclined to suppose, in a state of dotage or imbecility.
Little Nelly, little Nelly!’ It would be impossible for any man, I care not what his form of speech might be, to express more affection than the dealer in curiosities did, in these four words.
She gives it cheerfully as you see, and it would break her heart if she knew that I suffered anybody else to do for me what her little hands could undertake.
The old man had again relapsed into his former abstraction and took no notice of what passed, but I remarked that when her laugh was over, the child’s bright eyes were dimmed with tears, called forth by the fullness of heart with which she welcomed her uncouth favourite after the little anxiety of the night.
‘Do I love thee, Nell?’ said he.
‘Say--do I love thee, Nell, or no?’ The child only answered by her caresses, and laid her head upon his breast.
‘Is it because thou know’st I love thee, and dost not like that I should seem to doubt it by my question?
Well, well--then let us say I love thee dearly.’ ‘Indeed, indeed you do,’ replied the child with great earnestness, ‘Kit knows you do.’ Kit, who in despatching his bread and meat had been swallowing two-thirds of his knife at every mouthful with the coolness of a juggler, stopped short in his operations on being thus appealed to, and bawled ‘Nobody isn’t such a fool as to say he doosn’t,’ after which he incapacitated himself for further conversation by taking a most prodigious sandwich at one bite.
When we reached the door, the child setting down the candle, turned to say good night and raised her face to kiss me.
His affection for the child might not be inconsistent with villany of the worst kind; even that very affection was in itself an extraordinary contradiction, or how could he leave her thus?
Disposed as I was to think badly of him, I never doubted that his love for her was real.
I want to see my sister, that you keep cooped up here, poisoning her mind with your sly secrets and pretending an affection for her that you may work her to death, and add a few scraped shillings every week to the money you can hardly count.
The silence was not of long duration, for Mr Swiveller, after favouring us with several melodious assurances that his heart was in the Highlands, and that he wanted but his Arab steed as a preliminary to the achievement of great feats of valour and loyalty, removed his eyes from the ceiling and subsided into prose again.
‘To love me, perhaps?’ pursued her brother with a sneer.
I believe you there!’ ‘But I love you dearly, Fred,’ said the child.
If you would leave off vexing him and making him unhappy, then I could love you more.’ ‘I see!’ said the young man, as he stooped carelessly over the child, and having kissed her, pushed her from him: ‘There--get you away now you have said your lesson.
He’ll tell you that I have no natural affection; and that I care no more for Nell, for her own sake, than I do for him.
‘Ask Mrs Quilp, pretty Mrs Quilp, obedient, timid, loving Mrs Quilp.
‘And so, neighbour,’ he added, ‘I’ll turn my face homewards, leaving my love for Nelly and hoping she may never lose her way again, though her doing so HAS procured me an honour I didn’t expect.’ With that he bowed and leered at me, and with a keen glance around which seemed to comprehend every object within his range of vision, however, small or trivial, went his way.
CHAPTER 4 Mr and Mrs Quilp resided on Tower Hill; and in her bower on Tower Hill Mrs Quilp was left to pine the absence of her lord, when he quitted her on the business which he had already seen to transact.
This was the signal for a general clamour, which beginning in a low murmur gradually swelled into a great noise in which everybody spoke at once, and all said that she being a young woman had no right to set up her opinions against the experiences of those who knew so much better; that it was very wrong of her not to take the advice of people who had nothing at heart but her good; that it was next door to being downright ungrateful to conduct herself in that manner; that if she had no respect for herself she ought to have some for other women, all of whom she compromised by her meekness; and that if she had no respect for other women, the time would come when other women would have no respect for her; and she would be very sorry for that, they could tell her.
It’s all very fine to talk,’ said Mrs Quilp with much simplicity, ‘but I know that if I was to die to-morrow, Quilp could marry anybody he pleased--now that he could, I know!’ There was quite a scream of indignation at this idea.
They would like to see him dare to think of marrying any of them; they would like to see the faintest approach to such a thing.
‘Very well,’ said Mrs Quilp, nodding her head, ‘as I said just now, it’s very easy to talk, but I say again that I know--that I’m sure--Quilp has such a way with him when he likes, that the best looking woman here couldn’t refuse him if I was dead, and she was free, and he chose to make love to her.
‘Mother knows,’ said Mrs Quilp, ‘that what I say is quite correct, for she often said so before we were married.
Didn’t you say so, mother?’ This inquiry involved the respected lady in rather a delicate position, for she certainly had been an active party in making her daughter Mrs Quilp, and, besides, it was not supporting the family credit to encourage the idea that she had married a man whom nobody else would have.
The lady from the Minories recounted a successful course of treatment under which she had placed her own husband, who, from manifesting one month after marriage unequivocal symptoms of the tiger, had by this means become subdued into a perfect lamb.
She’s married now, you know.
The same glance at the mirror conveyed to her the reflection of a horribly grotesque and distorted face with the tongue lolling out; and the next instant the dwarf, turning about with a perfectly bland and placid look, inquired in a tone of great affection.
Reach me yonder hat, my dear, and we’ll go directly.’ With that, Mr Quilp suffered himself to roll gradually off the desk until his short legs touched the ground, when he got upon them and led the way from the counting-house to the wharf outside, when the first objects that presented themselves were the boy who had stood on his head and another young gentleman of about his own stature, rolling in the mud together, locked in a tight embrace, and cuffing each other with mutual heartiness.
‘I love the child--if you could do without making me deceive her--’ The dwarf muttering a terrible oath looked round as if for some weapon with which to inflict condign punishment upon his disobedient wife.
‘Thank you,’ returned the child, kissing her cheek, ‘you are always kind to me, and it is a pleasure to talk to you.
I think he loves me better every day, and is kinder and more affectionate than he was the day before.
You do not know how fond he is of me!’ ‘I am sure he loves you dearly,’ said Mrs Quilp.
‘Indeed, indeed he does!’ cried Nell, ‘as dearly as I love him.
What shall I do!’ The fountains of her heart were opened; the child, overpowered by the weight of her sorrows and anxieties, by the first confidence she had ever shown, and the sympathy with which her little tale had been received, hid her face in the arms of her helpless friend, and burst into a passion of tears.
No word of its real use, no hint of its nightly service, no allusion to its peculiar properties, had ever passed between him and his most intimate friends.
‘With all my heart,’ said Mr Swiveller.
Not to beat about the bush (for the advantages of the scheme would take a week to tell) what’s to prevent your marrying her?’ Richard Swiveller, who had been looking over the rim of the tumbler while his companion addressed the foregoing remarks to him with great energy and earnestness of manner, no sooner heard these words than he evinced the utmost consternation, and with difficulty ejaculated the monosyllable: ‘What!’ ‘I say, what’s to prevent,’ repeated the other with a steadiness of manner, of the effect of which upon his companion he was well assured by long experience, ‘what’s to prevent your marrying her?’ ‘And she “nearly fourteen”!’ cried Dick.
‘I don’t mean marrying her now’--returned the brother angrily; ‘say in two year’s time, in three, in four.
‘There’s the rub.’ ‘I say,’ resumed his friend, ‘suppose he lives, and I persuaded, or if the word sounds more feasible, forced Nell to a secret marriage with you.
What will you doubt next, Dick?’ It would be tedious to pursue the conversation through all its artful windings, or to develope the gradual approaches by which the heart of Richard Swiveller was gained.
The negotiation was concluded very pleasantly, and Mr Swiveller was in the act of stating in flowery terms that he had no insurmountable objection to marrying anybody plentifully endowed with money or moveables, who could be induced to take him, when he was interrupted in his observations by a knock at the door, and the consequent necessity of crying ‘Come in.’ The door was opened, but nothing came in except a soapy arm and a strong gush of tobacco.
‘It’s rather sudden,’ said Dick shaking his head with a look of infinite wisdom, and running on (as he was accustomed to do) with scraps of verse as if they were only prose in a hurry; ‘when the heart of a man is depressed with fears, the mist is dispelled when Miss Wackles appears; she’s a very nice girl.
But Mr Cheggs came not alone or unsupported, for he prudently brought along with him his sister, Miss Cheggs, who making straight to Miss Sophy and taking her by both hands, and kissing her on both cheeks, hoped in an audible whisper that they had not come too early.
At this momentous crisis, Miss Cheggs proved herself a vigourous and useful ally, for not confining herself to expressing by scornful smiles a contempt for Mr Swiveller’s accomplishments, she took every opportunity of whispering into Miss Sophy’s ear expressions of condolence and sympathy on her being worried by such a ridiculous creature, declaring that she was frightened to death lest Alick should fall upon, and beat him, in the fulness of his wrath, and entreating Miss Sophy to observe how the eyes of the said Alick gleamed with love and fury; passions, it may be observed, which being too much for his eyes rushed into his nose also, and suffused it with a crimson glow.
‘All manner of things,’ replied Miss Cheggs, ‘you can’t think how out he has been speaking!’ Richard Swiviller considered it advisable to hear no more, but taking advantage of a pause in the dancing, and the approach of Mr Cheggs to pay his court to the old lady, swaggered with an extremely careful assumption of extreme carelessness toward the door, passing on the way Miss Jane Wackles, who in all the glory of her curls was holding a flirtation, (as good practice when no better was to be had) with a feeble old gentleman who lodged in the parlour.
‘Are you going?’ said Miss Sophy, whose heart sank within her at the result of her stratagem, but who affected a light indifference notwithstanding.
‘I came here,’ said Dick, rather oblivious of the purpose with which he had really come, ‘with my bosom expanded, my heart dilated, and my sentiments of a corresponding description.
Good night.’ ‘There’s one good thing springs out of all this,’ said Richard Swiviller to himself when he had reached home and was hanging over the candle with the extinguisher in his hand, ‘which is, that I now go heart and soul, neck and heels, with Fred in all his scheme about little Nelly, and right glad he’ll be to find me so strong upon it.
He shall know all about that to-morrow, and in the meantime, as it’s rather late, I’ll try and get a wink of the balmy.’ ‘The balmy’ came almost as soon as it was courted.
In a very few minutes Mr Swiviller was fast asleep, dreaming that he had married Nelly Trent and come into the property, and that his first act of power was to lay waste the market-garden of Mr Cheggs and turn it into a brick-field.
Besides that it was very difficult to impart to any person not intimately acquainted with the life she led, an adequate sense of its gloom and loneliness, a constant fear of in some way committing or injuring the old man to whom she was so tenderly attached, had restrained her, even in the midst of her heart’s overflowing, and made her timid of allusion to the main cause of her anxiety and distress.
When he could, for a moment, disengage his mind from the phantom that haunted and brooded on it always, there was his young companion with the same smile for him, the same earnest words, the same merry laugh, the same love and care that, sinking deep into his soul, seemed to have been present to him through his whole life.
And so he went on, content to read the book of her heart from the page first presented to him, little dreaming of the story that lay hidden in its other leaves, and murmuring within himself that at least the child was happy.
But, now, the chambers were cold and gloomy, and when she left her own little room to while away the tedious hours, and sat in one of them, she was still and motionless as their inanimate occupants, and had no heart to startle the echoes--hoarse from their long silence--with her voice.
If he were to die--if sudden illness had happened to him, and he were never to come home again, alive--if, one night, he should come home, and kiss and bless her as usual, and after she had gone to bed and had fallen asleep and was perhaps dreaming pleasantly, and smiling in her sleep, he should kill himself and his blood come creeping, creeping, on the ground to her own bed-room door!
If you are poor, let us be poor together; but let me be with you, do let me be with you; do not let me see such change and not know why, or I shall break my heart and die.
Good-bye, little Nelly.’ Nell looked at the old man, who nodded to her to retire, and kissed her cheek.
‘Ah!’ said the dwarf, smacking his lips, ‘what a nice kiss that was--just upon the rosy part.
What a capital kiss!’ Nell was none the slower in going away, for this remark.
‘I call Heaven to witness that I never played for gain of mine, or love of play; that at every piece I staked, I whispered to myself that orphan’s name and called on Heaven to bless the venture;--which it never did.
If I were alone, I could die with gladness--perhaps even anticipate that doom which is dealt out so unequally: coming, as it does, on the proud and happy in their strength, and shunning the needy and afflicted, and all who court it in their despair--but what I have done, has been for her.
Without relaxing his pace, or stopping to take breath, this mysterious individual dashed on through a great many alleys and narrow ways until he at length arrived in a square paved court, when he subsided into a walk, and making for a small house from the window of which a light was shining, lifted the latch of the door and passed in.
‘Wait till he’s a widder and works like you do, and gets as little, and does as much, and keeps his spirit up the same, and then I’ll ask him what’s o’clock and trust him for being right to half a second.’ ‘Well,’ said Mrs Nubbles, evading the point, ‘your beer’s down there by the fender, Kit.’ ‘I see,’ replied her son, taking up the porter pot, ‘my love to you, mother.
Some people would say that you’d fallen in love with her, I know they would.’ To this, Kit only replied by bashfully bidding his mother ‘get out,’ and forming sundry strange figures with his legs and arms, accompanied by sympathetic contortions of his face.
I hope he will be sorry and do well somewhere else and not take this to heart too much.
Good night!’ With the tears streaming down her face, and her slight figure trembling with the agitation of the scene she had left, the shock she had received, the errand she had just discharged, and a thousand painful and affectionate feelings, the child hastened to the door, and disappeared as rapidly as she had come.
I can say that, with a true and honest heart, any way.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Perhaps you think it would be noisy, but there’s not a quieter court than ours in all the town.
Surrounded by unfeeling creditors, and mercenary attendants upon the sick, and meeting in the height of her anxiety and sorrow with little regard or sympathy even from the women about her, it is not surprising that the affectionate heart of the child should have been touched to the quick by one kind and generous spirit, however uncouth the temple in which it dwelt.
He would sit, for hours together, with Nell’s small hand in his, playing with the fingers and stopping sometimes to smooth her hair or kiss her brow; and, when he saw that tears were glistening in her eyes, would look, amazed, about him for the cause, and forget his wonder even while he looked.
Where, in the sharp lineaments of rigid and unsightly death, is the calm beauty of slumber, telling of rest for the waking hours that are past, and gentle hopes and loves for those which are to come?
But now he shed tears--tears that it lightened her aching heart to see--and making as though he would fall upon his knees, besought her to forgive him.
The child’s heart beat high with hope and confidence.
How could she ever have thought of bidding them farewell in triumph, when the recollection of the many hours she had passed among them rose to her swelling heart, and made her feel the wish a cruelty: lonely and sad though many of those hours had been!
She was calmed and comforted by the thought, and went to rest with a lighter heart.
‘It’s a strange way of going,’ he said, glancing at Swiveller, ‘very strange not to communicate with me who am such a close and intimate friend of his!
‘Keeping his place of retirement very close, that he may not be visited too often by affectionate grandsons and their devoted friends, eh?’ added the dwarf, rubbing his hands hard; ‘I say nothing, but is that your meaning?’ Richard Swiveller was utterly aghast at this unexpected alteration of circumstances, which threatened the complete overthrow of the project in which he bore so conspicuous a part, and seemed to nip his prospects in the bud.
Having only received from Frederick Trent, late on the previous night, information of the old man’s illness, he had come upon a visit of condolence and inquiry to Nell, prepared with the first instalment of that long train of fascinations which was to fire her heart at last.
In his secret heart, Daniel Quilp was both surprised and troubled by the flight which had been made.
Therefore, it was a relief to vex his heart with a picture of the riches the old man hoarded, and to expatiate on his cunning in removing himself even beyond the reach of importunity.
‘Marrying as his mother and I did, late in life, sir, after waiting for a great many years, until we were well enough off--coming together when we were no longer young, and then being blessed with one child who has always been dutiful and affectionate--why, it’s a source of great happiness to us both, sir.’ ‘Of course it is, I have no doubt of it,’ returned the Notary in a sympathising voice.
It was enough to leave dumb things behind, and objects that were insensible both to her love and sorrow.
To have parted from her only other friend upon the threshold of that wild journey, would have wrung her heart indeed.
We do not shun our dying friends; the not having distinctly taken leave of one among them, whom we left in all kindness and affection, will often embitter the whole remainder of a life.
He pressed his finger on his lip, and drew the child along by narrow courts and winding ways, nor did he seem at ease until they had left it far behind, often casting a backward look towards it, murmuring that ruin and self-murder were crouching in every street, and would follow if they scented them; and that they could not fly too fast.
I loved thee all the while, indeed I did.
I’m quite ready, grandfather.’ But the woman had observed, from the young wanderer’s gait, that one of her little feet was blistered and sore, and being a woman and a mother too, she would not suffer her to go until she had washed the place and applied some simple remedy, which she did so carefully and with such a gentle hand--rough-grained and hard though it was, with work--that the child’s heart was too full to admit of her saying more than a fervent ‘God bless you!’ nor could she look back nor trust herself to speak, until they had left the cottage some distance behind.
(Punch, it may be remarked, seemed to be pointing with the tip of his cap to a most flourishing epitaph, and to be chuckling over it with all his heart.)
And now Mr Thomas Codlin, the misanthrope, after blowing away at the Pan’s pipes until he was intensely wretched, took his station on one side of the checked drapery which concealed the mover of the figures, and putting his hands in his pockets prepared to reply to all questions and remarks of Punch, and to make a dismal feint of being his most intimate private friend, of believing in him to the fullest and most unlimited extent, of knowing that he enjoyed day and night a merry and glorious existence in that temple, and that he was at all times and under every circumstance the same intelligent and joyful person that the spectators then beheld him.
The supper was very good, but she was too tired to eat, and yet would not leave the old man until she had kissed him in his bed.
Her resolution taken, she sewed the piece of gold into her dress, and going to bed with a lighter heart sunk into a deep slumber.
The old woman thanked her when she had done, saying that she had had the words by heart for many a long, long year, but could not see them now.
It’s a long time, and I’m getting very old.’ Then growing garrulous upon a theme which was new to one listener though it were but a child, she told her how she had wept and moaned and prayed to die herself, when this happened; and how when she first came to that place, a young creature strong in love and grief, she had hoped that her heart was breaking as it seemed to be.
Mr Codlin, still doomed to contemplate the harsh realities of existence, was packing among his linen the candle-ends which had been saved from the previous night’s performance; while his companion received the compliments of all the loungers in the stable-yard, who, unable to separate him from the master-mind of Punch, set him down as next in importance to that merry outlaw, and loved him scarcely less.
There was a deep red ruddy blush upon the room, and when the landlord stirred the fire, sending the flames skipping and leaping up--when he took off the lid of the iron pot and there rushed out a savoury smell, while the bubbling sound grew deeper and more rich, and an unctuous steam came floating out, hanging in a delicious mist above their heads--when he did this, Mr Codlin’s heart was touched.
‘Dead, sir.’ ‘Mother?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘Married again--eh?’ Kit made answer, not without some indignation, that she was a widow with three children, and that as to her marrying again, if the gentleman knew her he wouldn’t think of such a thing.
When he came to the corner of the court in which he lived, lo and behold there was the pony again!
It was settled that Kit should repair to his new abode on the next day but one, in the morning; and finally, the little old couple, after bestowing a bright half-crown on little Jacob and another on the baby, took their leaves; being escorted as far as the street by their new attendant, who held the obdurate pony by the bridle while they took their seats, and saw them drive away with a lightened heart.
He shall marry Nell.
Now I say, mother, pray don’t take to going there regularly, for if I was to see your good-humoured face that has always made home cheerful, turned into a grievous one, and the baby trained to look grievous too, and to call itself a young sinner (bless its heart) and a child of the devil (which is calling its dead father names); if I was to see this, and see little Jacob looking grievous likewise, I should so take it to heart that I’m sure I should go and list for a soldier, and run my head on purpose against the first cannon-ball I saw coming my way.’ ‘Oh, Kit, don’t talk like that.’ ‘I would, indeed, mother, and unless you want to make me feel very wretched and uncomfortable, you’ll keep that bow on your bonnet, which you’d more than half a mind to pull off last week.
With more kisses, and hugs, and tears, than many young gentlemen who start upon their travels, and leave well-stocked homes behind them, would deem within the bounds of probability (if matter so low could be herein set down), Kit left the house at an early hour next morning, and set out to walk to Finchley; feeling a sufficient pride in his appearance to have warranted his excommunication from Little Bethel from that time forth, if he had ever been one of that mournful congregation.
From all these mute signs and tokens of her presence, he naturally glanced at Barbara herself, who sat as mute as they, shelling peas into a dish; and just when Kit was looking at her eyelashes and wondering--quite in the simplicity of his heart--what colour her eyes might be, it perversely happened that Barbara raised her head a little to look at him, when both pair of eyes were hastily withdrawn, and Kit leant over his plate, and Barbara over her pea-shells, each in extreme confusion at having been detected by the other.
Then he told his secret over again, with the addition of being pathetic on the subject of Miss Wackles, who, he gave Mr Quilp to understand, was the occasion of any slight incoherency he might observe in his speech at that moment, which was attributable solely to the strength of his affection and not to rosy wine or other fermented liquor.
And then they went on arm-in-arm, very lovingly together.
This was a question more difficult of solution; but as knaves generally overreach themselves by imputing their own designs to others, the idea immediately presented itself that some circumstances of irritation between Quilp and the old man, arising out of their secret transactions and not unconnected perhaps with his sudden disappearance, now rendered the former desirous of revenging himself upon him by seeking to entrap the sole object of his love and anxiety into a connexion of which he knew he had a dread and hatred.
As Frederick Trent himself, utterly regardless of his sister, had this object at heart, only second to the hope of gain, it seemed to him the more likely to be Quilp’s main principle of action.
‘And when the Mary Anne returned with you on board, instead of a letter to say what a contrite heart you had, and how happy you were in the situation that had been provided for you, I was amused--exceedingly amused.
Shall he marry little rosy Nell by-and-by?’ ‘You have some end of your own to answer, of course,’ returned the other.
Trent was pronouncing an encomium upon his wife, and they were both wondering by what enchantment she had been brought to marry such a misshapen wretch as he.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Separation from her grandfather was the greatest evil she could dread; and feeling for the time as though, go where they would, they were to be hunted down, and could never be safe but in hiding, her heart failed her, and her courage drooped.
But, Nature often enshrines gallant and noble hearts in weak bosoms--oftenest, God bless her, in female breasts--and when the child, casting her tearful eyes upon the old man, remembered how weak he was, and how destitute and helpless he would be if she failed him, her heart swelled within her, and animated her with new strength and fortitude.
do not say that,’ replied the child, ‘for if ever anybody was true at heart, and earnest, I am.
‘That’s beautiful writing, my dear.’ ‘Very, Sir,’ replied the child modestly, ‘is it yours?’ ‘Mine!’ he returned, taking out his spectacles and putting them on, to have a better view of the triumphs so dear to his heart.
That I should love him is no wonder, but that he should love me--’ and there the schoolmaster stopped, and took off his spectacles to wipe them, as though they had grown dim.
Then began the hum of conning over lessons and getting them by heart, the whispered jest and stealthy game, and all the noise and drawl of school; and in the midst of the din sat the poor schoolmaster, the very image of meekness and simplicity, vainly attempting to fix his mind upon the duties of the day, and to forget his little friend.
Then he would stop and tell them what the sick child had said last night, and how he had longed to be among them once again; and such was the poor schoolmaster’s gentle and affectionate manner, that the boys seemed quite remorseful that they had worried him so much, and were absolutely quiet; eating no apples, cutting no names, inflicting no pinches, and making no grimaces, for full two minutes afterwards.
‘I am afraid to kiss her, lest I should make her ill.
The two old friends and companions--for such they were, though they were man and child--held each other in a long embrace, and then the little scholar turned his face towards the wall, and fell asleep.
But the sad scene she had witnessed, was not without its lesson of content and gratitude; of content with the lot which left her health and freedom; and gratitude that she was spared to the one relative and friend she loved, and to live and move in a beautiful world, when so many young creatures--as young and full of hope as she--were stricken down and gathered to their graves.
And though she thought as a child herself, and did not perhaps sufficiently consider to what a bright and happy existence those who die young are borne, and how in death they lose the pain of seeing others die around them, bearing to the tomb some strong affection of their hearts (which makes the old die many times in one long life), still she thought wisely enough, to draw a plain and easy moral from what she had seen that night, and to store it, deep in her mind.
But he bade her put it up, and stooping to kiss her cheek, turned back into his house.
Mr Slum then withdrew to alter the acrostic, after taking a most affectionate leave of his patroness, and promising to return, as soon as he possibly could, with a fair copy for the printer.
‘That, ladies and gentlemen,’ said Mrs Jarley, ‘is Jasper Packlemerton of atrocious memory, who courted and married fourteen wives, and destroyed them all, by tickling the soles of their feet when they were sleeping in the consciousness of innocence and virtue.
The light cart in which the Brigand usually made his perambulations being gaily dressed with flags and streamers, and the Brigand placed therein, contemplating the miniature of his beloved as usual, Nell was accommodated with a seat beside him, decorated with artificial flowers, and in this state and ceremony rode slowly through the town every morning, dispersing handbills from a basket, to the sound of drum and trumpet.
The Brigand, heretofore a source of exclusive interest in the streets, became a mere secondary consideration, and to be important only as a part of the show of which she was the chief attraction.
Grown-up folks began to be interested in the bright-eyed girl, and some score of little boys fell desperately in love, and constantly left enclosures of nuts and apples, directed in small-text, at the wax-work door.
He was very patient and willing, happy to execute any little task, and glad to be of use; but he was in the same listless state, with no prospect of improvement--a mere child--a poor, thoughtless, vacant creature--a harmless fond old man, susceptible of tender love and regard for her, and of pleasant and painful impressions, but alive to nothing more.
But, the bitterness of her grief was not in beholding him in this condition, when he was at least content and tranquil, nor in her solitary meditations on his altered state, though these were trials for a young heart.
With these words, the speaker tapped himself on the waistcoat to intimate that he was the Jem Groves so highly eulogized; sparred scientifically at a counterfeit Jem Groves, who was sparring at society in general from a black frame over the chimney-piece; and, applying a half-emptied glass of spirits and water to his lips, drank Jem Groves’s health.
‘Then who knows but the gentleman, anticipating our objection to play for love, civilly desired to play for money?’ The old man replied by shaking the little purse in his eager hand, and then throwing it down upon the table, and gathering up the cards as a miser would clutch at gold.
Be of good heart, it’s all for thee--all--every penny.
Then there were some rambling allusions to a rejected sweetheart, who had threatened to go a soldiering--a final promise of knocking at the door early in the morning--and ‘Good night.’ The child did not feel comfortable when she was left alone.
She had no fear of the dear old grandfather, in whose love for her this disease of the brain had been engendered; but the man she had seen that night, wrapt in the game of chance, lurking in her room, and counting the money by the glimmering light, seemed like another creature in his shape, a monstrous distortion of his image, a something to recoil from, and be the more afraid of, because it bore a likeness to him, and kept close about her, as he did.
She could scarcely connect her own affectionate companion, save by his loss, with this old man, so like yet so unlike him.
‘God bless him!’ said the child, stooping softly to kiss his placid cheek.
After a time he kissed her cheek, still motioning her to silence, and walked on, looking far before him, and sometimes stopping and gazing with a puckered brow upon the ground, as if he were painfully trying to collect his disordered thoughts.
Nell immediately applied herself with great assiduity to the decoration and preparation of the room, and had the satisfaction of completing her task, and dressing herself neatly, before the beloved of the Royal Family came down to breakfast.
Miss Monflathers only tossed her head in reply, and the great gate closed upon a bursting heart.
Worn out as she was, and fatigued in mind and body, she sat up alone, counting the minutes, until he returned--penniless, broken-spirited, and wretched, but still hotly bent upon his infatuation.
Distracted by these thoughts, borne down by the weight of the sorrow which she dared not tell, tortured by a crowd of apprehensions whenever the old man was absent, and dreading alike his stay and his return, the colour forsook her cheek, her eye grew dim, and her heart was oppressed and heavy.
She would often think, if she had such a friend as that to whom to tell her griefs, how much lighter her heart would be--that if she were but free to hear that voice, she would be happier.
But one evening, as Nell was returning from a lonely walk, she happened to pass the inn where the stage-coaches stopped, just as one drove up, and there was the beautiful girl she so well remembered, pressing forward to embrace a young child whom they were helping down from the roof.
Nell felt as if her heart would break when she saw them meet.
Why did she bear a grateful heart because they had met, and feel it pain to think that they would shortly part?
It was a weak fancy perhaps, the childish fancy of a young and lonely creature; but night after night, and still the sisters loitered in the same place, and still the child followed with a mild and softened heart.
A rickety table, with spare bundles of papers, yellow and ragged from long carriage in the pocket, ostentatiously displayed upon its top; a couple of stools set face to face on opposite sides of this crazy piece of furniture; a treacherous old chair by the fire-place, whose withered arms had hugged full many a client and helped to squeeze him dry; a second-hand wig box, used as a depository for blank writs and declarations and other small forms of law, once the sole contents of the head which belonged to the wig which belonged to the box, as they were now of the box itself; two or three common books of practice; a jar of ink, a pounce box, a stunted hearth-broom, a carpet trodden to shreds but still clinging with the tightness of desperation to its tacks--these, with the yellow wainscot of the walls, the smoke-discoloured ceiling, the dust and cobwebs, were among the most prominent decorations of the office of Mr Sampson Brass.
Miss Sally Brass, then, was a lady of thirty-five or thereabouts, of a gaunt and bony figure, and a resolute bearing, which if it repressed the softer emotions of love, and kept admirers at a distance, certainly inspired a feeling akin to awe in the breasts of those male strangers who had the happiness to approach her.
In mind, she was of a strong and vigorous turn, having from her earliest youth devoted herself with uncommon ardour to the study of law; not wasting her speculations upon its eagle flights, which are rare, but tracing it attentively through all the slippery and eel-like crawlings in which it commonly pursues its way.
It is difficult to understand how, possessed of these combined attractions, she should remain Miss Brass; but whether she had steeled her heart against mankind, or whether those who might have wooed and won her, were deterred by fears that, being learned in the law, she might have too near her fingers’ ends those particular statutes which regulate what are familiarly termed actions for breach, certain it is that she was still in a state of celibacy, and still in daily occupation of her old stool opposite to that of her brother Sampson.
One morning Mr Sampson Brass sat upon his stool copying some legal process, and viciously digging his pen deep into the paper, as if he were writing upon the very heart of the party against whom it was directed; and Miss Sally Brass sat upon her stool making a new pen preparatory to drawing out a little bill, which was her favourite occupation; and so they sat in silence for a long time, until Miss Brass broke silence.
‘Don’t you be a fool and provoke me, Sammy, but mind what you’re doing, and do it.’ Sampson Brass, who was at heart in great fear of his sister, sulkily bent over his writing again, and listened as she said: ‘If I determined that the clerk ought not to come, of course he wouldn’t be allowed to come.
Be quick and open the door, or if there’s another lawyer near and he should happen to look out of window, he’ll snap him up before your eyes, he will.’ It is probable that the loss of the phoenix of clerks, even to a rival practitioner, would not have broken Mr Brass’s heart; but, pretending great alacrity, he rose from his seat, and going to the door, returned, introducing his client, who led by the hand no less a person than Mr Richard Swiveller.
‘There she is,’ said Quilp, stopping short at the door, and wrinkling up his eyebrows as he looked towards Miss Sally; ‘there is the woman I ought to have married--there is the beautiful Sarah--there is the female who has all the charms of her sex and none of their weaknesses.
Oh Sally, Sally!’ To this amorous address Miss Brass briefly responded ‘Bother!’ ‘Hard-hearted as the metal from which she takes her name,’ said Quilp.
This is Mr Swiveller, my intimate friend--a gentleman of good family and great expectations, but who, having rather involved himself by youthful indiscretion, is content for a time to fill the humble station of a clerk--humble, but here most enviable.
This is the more probable from the circumstance of Mr Swiveller directing his observations to the ceiling, which these bodily personages are usually supposed to inhabit--except in theatrical cases, when they live in the heart of the great chandelier.
My aunt in the country stops the supplies, and writes an affectionate note to say that she has made a new will, and left me out of it--staggerer, number two.
Indeed he so overflowed with liberality and condescension, that, in the fulness of his heart, he invited Mr Swiveller to partake of a bowl of punch with him at that remote and indefinite period which is currently denominated ‘one of these days,’ and paid him many handsome compliments on the uncommon aptitude for business which his conduct on the first day of his devotion to it had so plainly evinced.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>‘When he who adores thee has left but the name--’ ‘What do you mean?’ ‘--But the name,’ said Dick--‘has left but the name--in case of letters or parcels--’ ‘I never have any,’ returned the lodger.
Let not the light scorners of female fascination erect their ears to listen to a new tale of love which shall serve them for a jest; for Miss Brass, however accurately formed to be beloved, was not of the loving kind.
Filled with this affectionate and touching sorrow, he had solemnly confided her to his son Sampson as an invaluable auxiliary; and from the old gentleman’s decease to the period of which we treat, Miss Sally Brass had been the prop and pillar of his business.
Mr Brass had said once, that he believed she was a ‘love-child’ (which means anything but a child of love), and that was all the information Richard Swiveller could obtain.
Did I always say I loved her, and doated on her?
What boastful father in the fulness of his heart ever related such wonders of his infant prodigy, as Kit never wearied of telling Barbara in the evening time, concerning little Jacob?
And let me linger in this place, for an instant, to remark that if ever household affections and loves are graceful things, they are graceful in the poor.
The man of high descent may love the halls and lands of his inheritance as part of himself: as trophies of his birth and power; his associations with them are associations of pride and wealth and triumph; the poor man’s attachment to the tenements he holds, which strangers have held before, and may to-morrow occupy again, has a worthier root, struck deep into a purer soil.
His household gods are of flesh and blood, with no alloy of silver, gold, or precious stone; he has no property but in the affections of his own heart; and when they endear bare floors and walls, despite of rags and toil and scanty fare, that man has his love of home from God, and his rude hut becomes a solemn place.
if those who rule the destinies of nations would but remember this--if they would but think how hard it is for the very poor to have engendered in their hearts, that love of home from which all domestic virtues spring, when they live in dense and squalid masses where social decency is lost, or rather never found--if they would but turn aside from the wide thoroughfares and great houses, and strive to improve the wretched dwellings in bye-ways where only Poverty may walk--many low roofs would point more truly to the sky, than the loftiest steeple that now rears proudly up from the midst of guilt, and crime, and horrible disease, to mock them by its contrast.
In love of home, the love of country has its rise; and who are the truer patriots or the better in time of need--those who venerate the land, owning its wood, and stream, and earth, and all that they produce?
or those who love their country, boasting not a foot of ground in all its wide domain!
Kit knew nothing about such questions, but he knew that his old home was a very poor place, and that his new one was very unlike it, and yet he was constantly looking back with grateful satisfaction and affectionate anxiety, and often indited square-folded letters to his mother, enclosing a shilling or eighteenpence or such other small remittance, which Mr Abel’s liberality enabled him to make.
Sometimes being in the neighbourhood, he had leisure to call upon her, and then great was the joy and pride of Kit’s mother, and extremely noisy the satisfaction of little Jacob and the baby, and cordial the congratulations of the whole court, who listened with admiring ears to the accounts of Abel Cottage, and could never be told too much of its wonders and magnificence.
One morning Kit drove Mr Abel to the Notary’s office, as he sometimes did, and having set him down at the house, was about to drive off to a livery stable hard by, when this same Mr Chuckster emerged from the office door, and cried ‘Woa-a-a-a-a-a!’--dwelling upon the note a long time, for the purpose of striking terror into the pony’s heart, and asserting the supremacy of man over the inferior animals.
I came to this city with a darling object at my heart, expecting to find no obstacle or difficulty in the way of its attainment.
‘Who ran to catch me when I fell, and kissed the place to make it well?
Well, wasn’t Mr Garland kind when he said ‘Christopher, here’s your money, and you have earned it well;’ and wasn’t Mrs Garland kind when she said ‘Barbara, here’s yours, and I’m much pleased with you;’ and didn’t Kit sign his name bold to his receipt, and didn’t Barbara sign her name all a trembling to hers; and wasn’t it beautiful to see how Mrs Garland poured out Barbara’s mother a glass of wine; and didn’t Barbara’s mother speak up when she said ‘Here’s blessing you, ma’am, as a good lady, and you, sir, as a good gentleman, and Barbara, my love to you, and here’s towards you, Mr Christopher;’ and wasn’t she as long drinking it as if it had been a tumblerful; and didn’t she look genteel, standing there with her gloves on; and wasn’t there plenty of laughing and talking among them as they reviewed all these things upon the top of the coach, and didn’t they pity the people who hadn’t got a holiday!
There she was, quite ready to receive them, with a display of tea-things that might have warmed the heart of a china-shop; and little Jacob and the baby in such a state of perfection that their clothes looked as good as new, though Heaven knows they were old enough!
There was the baby too, who had never closed an eye all night, but had sat as good as gold, trying to force a large orange into his mouth, and gazing intently at the lights in the chandelier--there he was, sitting up in his mother’s lap, staring at the gas without winking, and making indentations in his soft visage with an oyster-shell, to that degree that a heart of iron must have loved him!
Then, Kit took little Jacob on his back, and giving his arm to his mother, and a kiss to the baby, they all trudged merrily home together.
And being careful not to awaken any of the little household, who were yet resting from their unusual fatigues, Kit left his money on the chimney-piece, with an inscription in chalk calling his mother’s attention to the circumstance, and informing her that it came from her dutiful son; and went his way, with a heart something heavier than his pockets, but free from any very great oppression notwithstanding.
By degrees, they began to recall circumstances more and more pleasant in their nature, until, what between talking, walking, and laughing, they reached Finchley in such good heart, that Barbara’s mother declared she never felt less tired or in better spirits.
It would break mother’s heart, Sir, and even little Jacob would have sense enough to cry his eyes out, ma’am, if he thought that Mr Abel could wish to part with me so soon, after having told me, only the other day, that he hoped we might be together for years to come--’ There is no telling how long Kit might have stood upon the ladder, addressing his master and mistress by turns, and generally turning towards the wrong person, if Barbara had not at that moment come running up to say that a messenger from the office had brought a note, which, with an expression of some surprise at Kit’s oratorical appearance, she put into her master’s hand.
Having entreated the old lady and gentleman to set their minds at rest on these absorbing points, for they might rely on his statement being the correct one, Mr Chuckster entertained them with theatrical chit-chat and the court circular; and so wound up a brilliant and fascinating conversation which he had maintained alone, and without any assistance whatever, for upwards of three-quarters of an hour.
Throw in what you want, and we’ll be off directly.’ To tell how Kit then hustled into the box all sorts of things which could, by no remote contingency, be wanted, and how he left out everything likely to be of the smallest use; how a neighbour was persuaded to come and stop with the children, and how the children at first cried dismally, and then laughed heartily on being promised all kinds of impossible and unheard-of toys; how Kit’s mother wouldn’t leave off kissing them, and how Kit couldn’t make up his mind to be vexed with her for doing it; would take more time and room than you and I can spare.
‘Ye’ll drive me mad among ye.’ The utter irresolution and feebleness of the grey-haired child, contrasted with the keen and cunning looks of those in whose hands he was, smote upon the little listener’s heart.
When they had all three amused themselves a little with their victim’s infatuation, they dismissed the subject as one which had been sufficiently discussed, and began to talk in a jargon which the child did not understand.
In the pale moonlight, which lent a wanness of its own to the delicate face where thoughtful care already mingled with the winning grace and loveliness of youth, the too bright eye, the spiritual head, the lips that pressed each other with such high resolve and courage of the heart, the slight figure firm in its bearing and yet so very weak, told their silent tale; but told it only to the wind that rustled by, which, taking up its burden, carried, perhaps to some mother’s pillow, faint dreams of childhood fading in its bloom, and resting in the sleep that knows no waking.
Avoiding the small cabin, therefore, which was very dark and filthy, and to which they often invited both her and her grandfather, Nell sat in the open air with the old man by her side: listening to their boisterous hosts with a palpitating heart, and almost wishing herself safe on shore again though she should have to walk all night.
Shivering with the cold and damp, ill in body, and sick to death at heart, the child needed her utmost firmness and resolution even to creep along.
Was I a happy man once, and have I lost happiness and all I had, for this!’ ‘If we were in the country now,’ said the child, with assumed cheerfulness, as they walked on looking about them for a shelter, we should find some good old tree, stretching out his green arms as if he loved us, and nodding and rustling as if he would have us fall asleep, thinking of him while he watched.
No, not even on that memorable morning, when, deserting their old home, they abandoned themselves to the mercies of a strange world, and left all the dumb and senseless things they had known and loved, behind--not even then, had they so yearned for the fresh solitudes of wood, hillside, and field, as now, when the noise and dirt and vapour, of the great manufacturing town reeking with lean misery and hungry wretchedness, hemmed them in on every side, and seemed to shut out hope, and render escape impossible.
if we live to reach the country once again, if we get clear of these dreadful places, though it is only to lie down and die, with what a grateful heart I shall thank God for so much mercy!’ With thoughts like this, and with some vague design of travelling to a great distance among streams and mountains, where only very poor and simple people lived, and where they might maintain themselves by very humble helping work in farms, free from such terrors as that from which they fled--the child, with no resource but the poor man’s gift, and no encouragement but that which flowed from her own heart, and its sense of the truth and right of what she did, nerved herself to this last journey and boldly pursued her task.
The key of this chamber happened by good fortune to be on that side of the door which was in Nell’s room; she turned it on him when the landlady had withdrawn, and crept to bed again with a thankful heart.
‘You should question me for half-a-dozen hours at a sitting, and welcome, and I would answer you patiently for the kindness of heart you have shown to-night, if I could,’ he said.
I know very little of the world, and perhaps you are better fitted to advise me in its affairs than I am qualified to give advice to you; but I am very sincere, and I have a reason (you have not forgotten it) for loving you.
I have felt since that time as if my love for him who died, had been transferred to you who stood beside his bed.
If this,’ he added, looking upwards, ‘is the beautiful creation that springs from ashes, let its peace prosper with me, as I deal tenderly and compassionately by this young child!’ The plain, frank kindness of the honest schoolmaster, the affectionate earnestness of his speech and manner, the truth which was stamped upon his every word and look, gave the child a confidence in him, which the utmost arts of treachery and dissimulation could never have awakened in her breast.
‘This child!’--he thought--‘Has this child heroically persevered under all doubts and dangers, struggled with poverty and suffering, upheld and sustained by strong affection and the consciousness of rectitude alone!
They had seemed to melt into a dim and airy distance, as the prospect of ever beholding them again grew fainter; but, as they receded, she had loved and panted for them more.
‘Be sure that I come back with good news, and am not long gone!’ So, the happy schoolmaster put on a bran-new pair of gloves which he had carried in a little parcel in his pocket all the way, and hurried off, full of ardour and excitement.
‘Who has been married here, my friend?’ said the single gentleman.
Mind, good people, if this fellow has been marrying a minor--tut, tut, that can’t be.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>When the chambermaid asked him just now if he should want a bed, sir, he first made faces at her, and then wanted to kiss her.’ ‘Beg him to walk this way,’ said the single gentleman.
I hate ‘em every one!’ This was not a mere empty vaunt, but a deliberate avowal of his real sentiments; for Mr Quilp, who loved nobody, had by little and little come to hate everybody nearly or remotely connected with his ruined client:--the old man himself, because he had been able to deceive him and elude his vigilance--the child, because she was the object of Mrs Quilp’s commiseration and constant self-reproach--the single gentleman, because of his unconcealed aversion to himself--Kit and his mother, most mortally, for the reasons shown.
‘That’s all.’ ‘Bless your eyes, how I love you,’ muttered Quilp.
Keeping his eye fixed on Sampson Brass, he walked up to the table, and beginning with his glass, drank off the contents, and went regularly round until he had emptied the other two, when he seized the case-bottle, and hugging it under his arm, surveyed him with a most extraordinary leer.
With this substantial comfort, the dwarf regaled himself to his heart’s content; and being highly satisfied with this free and gipsy mode of life (which he had often meditated, as offering, whenever he chose to avail himself of it, an agreeable freedom from the restraints of matrimony, and a choice means of keeping Mrs Quilp and her mother in a state of incessant agitation and suspense), bestirred himself to improve his retreat, and render it more commodious and comfortable.
Yet loved I as man never loved that hadn’t wooden legs, and my heart, my heart is breaking for the love of Sophy Cheggs.’ With this extemporary adaptation of a popular ballad to the distressing circumstances of his own case, Mr Swiveller folded up the parcel again, beat it very flat between the palms of his hands, thrust it into his breast, buttoned his coat over it, and folded his arms upon the whole.
‘Does she like it?’ ‘She’ll like it better,’ returned that strong-minded lady, ‘when she has tea; so let us have it, and don’t bother.’ ‘Sweet Sally!’ cried Quilp, extending his arms as if about to embrace her.
It was ten o’clock at night before the amiable Sally supported her beloved and loving brother from the Wilderness, by which time he needed the utmost support her tender frame could render; his walk being from some unknown reason anything but steady, and his legs constantly doubling up in unexpected places.
If any had, it had still felt for it a love like that which captives have been known to bear towards the cell in which they have been long confined, and, even at parting, hung upon its narrow bounds affectionately.
He loved the child as though she were his own.
You must look to this, and see that her heart does not grow heavy among these solemn ruins.
You are not the less welcome, friend, for her sake, or for this old man’s; nor the worse teacher for having learnt humanity.’ ‘She has been ill, sir, very lately,’ said the schoolmaster, in answer to the look with which their visitor regarded Nell when he had kissed her cheek.
I sent the boy two guineas anonymously, sir,’ added the bachelor, in his peculiar whisper, ‘directly I heard of it; but never mention it on any account, for he hasn’t the least idea that it came from me.’ Having disposed of this culprit, the bachelor turned to another, and from him to another, and so on through the whole array, laying, for their wholesome restriction within due bounds, the same cutting emphasis on such of their propensities as were dearest to his heart and were unquestionably referrable to his own precept and example.
Hailing these little tokens of the bachelor’s disposition as so many assurances of his own welcome course from that time, the schoolmaster parted from him with a light heart and joyous spirits, and deemed himself one of the happiest men on earth.
It was greener, he said, than all the other gardens, and the birds loved it better because he had been used to feed them.
In ten years more, the well dried up; and now, if you lower the bucket till your arms are tired, and let out nearly all the cord, you’ll hear it, of a sudden, clanking and rattling on the ground below; with a sound of being so deep and so far down, that your heart leaps into your mouth, and you start away as if you were falling in.’ ‘A dreadful place to come on in the dark!’ exclaimed the child, who had followed the old man’s looks and words until she seemed to stand upon its brink.
She looked pale but very happy, until they separated for the night; and then, as the poor schoolmaster stooped down to kiss her cheek, he thought he felt a tear upon his face.
As he was not one of those rough spirits who would strip fair Truth of every little shadowy vestment in which time and teeming fancies love to array her--and some of which become her pleasantly enough, serving, like the waters of her well, to add new graces to the charms they half conceal and half suggest, and to awaken interest and pursuit rather than languor and indifference--as, unlike this stern and obdurate class, he loved to see the goddess crowned with those garlands of wild flowers which tradition wreathes for her gentle wearing, and which are often freshest in their homeliest shapes--he trod with a light step and bore with a light hand upon the dust of centuries, unwilling to demolish any of the airy shrines that had been raised above it, if any good feeling or affection of the human heart were hiding thereabouts.
Thus, in the case of an ancient coffin of rough stone, supposed, for many generations, to contain the bones of a certain baron, who, after ravaging, with cut, and thrust, and plunder, in foreign lands, came back with a penitent and sorrowing heart to die at home, but which had been lately shown by learned antiquaries to be no such thing, as the baron in question (so they contended) had died hard in battle, gnashing his teeth and cursing with his latest breath--the bachelor stoutly maintained that the old tale was the true one; that the baron, repenting him of the evil, had done great charities and meekly given up the ghost; and that, if ever baron went to heaven, that baron was then at peace.
In like manner, when the aforesaid antiquaries did argue and contend that a certain secret vault was not the tomb of a grey-haired lady who had been hanged and drawn and quartered by glorious Queen Bess for succouring a wretched priest who fainted of thirst and hunger at her door, the bachelor did solemnly maintain, against all comers, that the church was hallowed by the said poor lady’s ashes; that her remains had been collected in the night from four of the city’s gates, and thither in secret brought, and there deposited; and the bachelor did further (being highly excited at such times) deny the glory of Queen Bess, and assert the immeasurably greater glory of the meanest woman in her realm, who had a merciful and tender heart.
‘They mark the graves of those who had very tender, loving friends.’ ‘I was sure they did!’ the child exclaimed.
‘But you must be gay sometimes--nay, don’t shake your head and smile so sadly.’ ‘Not sadly, if you knew my heart.
An infant, a prattling child, dying in its cradle, will live again in the better thoughts of those who loved it, and will play its part, through them, in the redeeming actions of the world, though its body be burnt to ashes or drowned in the deepest sea.
There is not an angel added to the Host of Heaven but does its blessed work on earth in those that loved it here.
oh, if the good deeds of human creatures could be traced to their source, how beautiful would even death appear; for how much charity, mercy, and purified affection, would be seen to have their growth in dusty graves!’ ‘Yes,’ said the child, ‘it is the truth; I know it is.
Dear, dear, good friend, if you knew the comfort you have given me!’ The poor schoolmaster made her no answer, but bent over her in silence; for his heart was full.
They were yet in the ardour of their work, when the child, raising her head from the ground over which she bent, observed that the bachelor was sitting on the stile close by, watching them in silence.
There are chords in the human heart--strange, varying strings--which are only struck by accident; which will remain mute and senseless to appeals the most passionate and earnest, and respond at last to the slightest casual touch.
Never, no, never once, in one unguarded moment from that time to the end, did any care for himself, any thought of his own comfort, any selfish consideration or regard distract his thoughts from the gentle object of his love.
He who knows all, can only know what hopes, and fears, and thoughts of deep affection, were in that one disordered brain, and what a change had fallen on the poor old man.
The old man would follow them at a little distance through the building, listening to the voice he loved so well; and when the strangers left, and parted from Nell, he would mingle with them to catch up fragments of their conversation; or he would stand for the same purpose, with his grey head uncovered, at the gate as they passed through.
But what was that, so often added, which wrung his heart, and made him sob and weep alone, in some dull corner!
Not yet.’ She looked at him wonderingly, and putting his hair back from his face, and kissing him, asked what he meant.
Willy went away, to join them; but if he had known how I should miss him in our little bed at night, he never would have left me, I am sure.’ Yet the child could make him no answer, and sobbed as though her heart were bursting.
They say that Willy is in Heaven now, and that it’s always summer there, and yet I’m sure he grieves when I lie down upon his garden bed, and he cannot turn to kiss me.
Tell him how I love him still, and how much I loved you; and when I think that you two are together, and are happy, I’ll try to bear it, and never give you pain by doing wrong--indeed I never will!’ The child suffered him to move her hands, and put them round his neck.
‘Twas ever thus--from childhood’s hour I’ve seen my fondest hopes decay, I never loved a tree or flower but ‘twas the first to fade away; I never nursed a dear Gazelle, to glad me with its soft black eye, but when it came to know me well, and love me, it was sure to marry a market-gardener.’ Overpowered by these reflections, Mr Swiveller stopped short at the clients’ chair, and flung himself into its open arms.
And I tell you what, Sir, if I hadn’t more of these qualities that commonly endear man to man, than our articled clerk has, I’d steal a Cheshire cheese, tie it round my neck, and drown myself.
It is the heart.
But the heart is the bird.
‘Dear me!’ ‘I little thought the first time I saw him, Sir,’ says Kit, pleased with the attorney’s strong interest in his favourite, ‘that I should come to be as intimate with him as I am now.’ ‘Ah!’ rejoins Mr Brass, brim-full of moral precepts and love of virtue.
Mr Brass would then set the office-door wide open, hum his old tune with great gaiety of heart, and smile seraphically as before.
‘How can I see any objection to such a kind offer, sir?’ replied Kit with his whole heart.
While they were on the way back, Mr Swiveller, upon whom his present functions sat very irksomely, took an opportunity of whispering in his ear that if he would confess his guilt, even by so much as a nod, and promise not to do so any more, he would connive at his kicking Sampson Brass on the shins and escaping up a court; but Kit indignantly rejecting this proposal, Mr Richard had nothing for it, but to hold him tight until they reached Bevis Marks, and ushered him into the presence of the charming Sarah, who immediately took the precaution of locking the door.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Absorbed in these painful ruminations, thinking with a drooping heart of his mother and little Jacob, feeling as though even the consciousness of innocence would be insufficient to support him in the presence of his friends if they believed him guilty, and sinking in hope and courage more and more as they drew nearer to the notary’s, poor Kit was looking earnestly out of the window, observant of nothing,--when all at once, as though it had been conjured up by magic, he became aware of the face of Quilp.
Bye bye, Kit; all good go with you; keep up your spirits; my love to the Garlands--the dear old lady and gentleman.
‘Sir,’ said Sampson, taking off his hat, and kissing the two fore-fingers of his right hand beaver glove, ‘my name is Brass--Brass of Bevis Marks, Sir.
Perhaps, gentlemen, if he had not said this in your presence and I had reported it, you’d have held this to be impossible likewise, eh?’ With such pacific and bantering remarks did Mr Brass refute the foul aspersion on his character; but the virtuous Sarah, moved by stronger feelings, and having at heart, perhaps, a more jealous regard for the honour of her family, flew from her brother’s side, without any previous intimation of her design, and darted at the prisoner with the utmost fury.
It would undoubtedly have gone hard with Kit’s face, but that the wary constable, foreseeing her design, drew him aside at the critical moment, and thus placed Mr Chuckster in circumstances of some jeopardy; for that gentleman happening to be next the object of Miss Brass’s wrath; and rage being, like love and fortune, blind; was pounced upon by the fair enslaver, and had a false collar plucked up by the roots, and his hair very much dishevelled, before the exertions of the company could make her sensible of her mistake.
Kit was thankful for this indulgence, and sat reading the church catechism very attentively (though he had known it by heart from a little child), until he heard the key in the lock, and the man entered again.
In the space between, sat a turnkey reading a newspaper, and outside the further railing, Kit saw, with a palpitating heart, his mother with the baby in her arms; Barbara’s mother with her never-failing umbrella; and poor little Jacob, staring in with all his might, as though he were looking for the bird, or the wild beast, and thought the men were mere accidents with whom the bars could have no possible concern.
But when little Jacob saw his brother, and, thrusting his arms between the rails to hug him, found that he came no nearer, but still stood afar off with his head resting on the arm by which he held to one of the bars, he began to cry most piteously; whereupon, Kit’s mother and Barbara’s mother, who had restrained themselves as much as possible, burst out sobbing and weeping afresh.
Come what may, I shall always have one drop of happiness in my heart when I think that you said that.’ At this the poor woman fell a-crying again, and Barbara’s mother too.
Nor did the burden of this performance bear any reference to love, or war, or wine, or loyalty, or any other, the standard topics of song, but to a subject not often set to music or generally known in ballads; the words being these:--‘The worthy magistrate, after remarking that the prisoner would find some difficulty in persuading a jury to believe his tale, committed him to take his trial at the approaching sessions; and directed the customary recognisances to be entered into for the pros-e-cu-tion.’ Every time he came to this concluding word, and had exhausted all possible stress upon it, Quilp burst into a shriek of laughter, and began again.
You esteem her, sir?’ ‘I love her,’ croaked the dwarf.
And didn’t he hope in his own heart that his gentleman was a match for the other gentleman, and would make him ashamed of himself in no time!
Wherefore, he begins by requesting the officer to be quite sure that this witness kisses the book, then goes to work at him, tooth and nail.
Kit bids her keep a good heart, and, under pretence of having the children lifted up to kiss him, prays Barbara’s mother in a whisper to take her home.
You must teach little Jacob and the baby how all this was, for if they thought I had ever been dishonest, when they grew old enough to understand, it would break my heart to know it, if I was thousands of miles away.--Oh!
While she was thus engaged, Mr Swiveller looked on with a grateful heart, very much astonished to see how thoroughly at home she made herself, and attributing this attention, in its origin, to Sally Brass, whom, in his own mind, he could not thank enough.
‘He’s enough to fret a man’s heart out,’ replied the hostler.
The manner of this meal was this:--Mr Swiveller, holding the slice of toast or cup of tea in his left hand, and taking a bite or drink, as the case might be, constantly kept, in his right, one palm of the Marchioness tight locked; and to shake, or even to kiss this imprisoned hand, he would stop every now and then, in the very act of swallowing, with perfect seriousness of intention, and the utmost gravity.
‘Wait a bit!’ So saying, and quite indifferent to the astonishment his presence occasioned, he crept in, shut the door, kissed his greasy glove as servilely as if it were the dust, and made a most abject bow.
But I know what I am about, my love, and will take the liberty of expressing myself accordingly.
But I am a falling house, and the rats (if I may be allowed the expression in reference to a gentleman I respect and love beyond everything) fly from me!
‘I say,’ pursued Brass, glancing aside at his sister, as though he were talking for her information, and speaking with a snarling malignity, in violent contrast to his usual smoothness, ‘that I answer to all these questions,--Quilp--Quilp, who deludes me into his infernal den, and takes a delight in looking on and chuckling while I scorch, and burn, and bruise, and maim myself--Quilp, who never once, no never once, in all our communications together, has treated me otherwise than as a dog--Quilp, whom I have always hated with my whole heart, but never so much as lately.
He has done as much by me, for many and many a day.’ Having now arrived at the conclusion of his discourse, Sampson checked the current of his wrath, kissed his glove again, and smiled as only parasites and cowards can.
It was a day to be at home, crowding about the fire, telling stories of travellers who had lost their way in such weather on heaths and moors; and to love a warm hearth more than ever.
It does my heart good to see your little nose so pinched and frosty.’ ‘Oh Quilp!’ sobbed his wife.
‘Did she think she was going to have all the money, and to marry somebody she liked?
Oh Brass, Brass--my dear, good, affectionate, faithful, complimentary, charming friend--if I only had you here!’ His wife, who had retreated lest she should seem to listen to these mutterings, ventured to approach him again, and was about to speak, when he hurried to the door, and called Tom Scott, who, remembering his late gentle admonition, deemed it prudent to appear immediately.
‘Oh Sampson!’ he muttered, ‘good worthy creature--if I could but hug you!
When he sat there,--yonder there, over there,--with his white face, and red head, and sickly smile, why didn’t I know what was passing in his heart?
CHAPTER 68 Lighted rooms, bright fires, cheerful faces, the music of glad voices, words of love and welcome, warm hearts, and tears of happiness--what a change is this!
And there, too, is the ever faithful Barbara’s mother, still holding the baby as if she had never put it down since that sad day when they little hoped to have such joy as this--there she is, Heaven bless her, crying her eyes out, and sobbing as never woman sobbed before; and there is little Barbara--poor little Barbara, so much thinner and so much paler, and yet so very pretty--trembling like a leaf and supporting herself against the wall; and there is Mrs Garland, neater and nicer than ever, fainting away stone dead with nobody to help her; and there is Mr Abel, violently blowing his nose, and wanting to embrace everybody; and there is the single gentleman hovering round them all, and constant to nothing for an instant; and there is that good, dear, thoughtful little Jacob, sitting all alone by himself on the bottom stair, with his hands on his knees like an old man, roaring fearfully without giving any trouble to anybody; and each and all of them are for the time clean out of their wits, and do jointly and severally commit all manner of follies.
The moment he lays his hand upon the latch, the pony neighs the loudest pony’s greeting; before he has crossed the threshold, the pony is capering about his loose box (for he brooks not the indignity of a halter), mad to give him welcome; and when Kit goes up to caress and pat him, the pony rubs his nose against his coat, and fondles him more lovingly than ever pony fondled man.
It is the crowning circumstance of his earnest, heartfelt reception; and Kit fairly puts his arm round Whisker’s neck and hugs him.
It may be that Kit has caressed the pony enough; it may be that there are even better things to caress than ponies.
Was it natural that at that instant, without any previous impulse or design, Kit should kiss Barbara?
How, although they loved each other as brothers should, they had not met for many years, but had communicated by letter from time to time, always looking forward to some period when they would take each other by the hand once more, and still letting the Present time steal on, as it was the habit for men to do, and suffering the Future to melt into the Past.
How this brother, whose temper was very mild and quiet and retiring--such as Mr Abel’s--was greatly beloved by the simple people among whom he dwelt, who quite revered the Bachelor (for so they called him), and had every one experienced his charity and benevolence.
How, for that reason, he seldom told them of his village friends; but how, for all that, his mind had become so full of two among them--a child and an old man, to whom he had been very kind--that, in a letter received a few days before, he had dwelt upon them from first to last, and had told such a tale of their wandering, and mutual love, that few could read it without being moved to tears.
But, had it been the beginning of some great labour with the same end in view--had it been the commencement of a long journey, to be performed on foot in that inclement season of the year, to be pursued under very privation and difficulty, and to be achieved only with great distress, fatigue, and suffering--had it been the dawn of some painful enterprise, certain to task his utmost powers of resolution and endurance, and to need his utmost fortitude, but only likely to end, if happily achieved, in good fortune and delight to Nell--Kit’s cheerful zeal would have been as highly roused: Kit’s ardour and impatience would have been, at least, the same.
Now, Barbara, if the truth must be told--as it must and ought to be--Barbara seemed, of all the little household, to take least pleasure in the bustle of the occasion; and when Kit, in the openness of his heart, told her how glad and overjoyed it made him, Barbara became more downcast still, and seemed to have even less pleasure in it than before!
There is no school in which a pupil gets on so fast, as that in which Kit became a scholar when he gave Barbara the kiss.
He saw what Barbara meant now--he had his lesson by heart all at once--she was the book--there it was before him, as plain as print.
When I think of myself, it’s as her old servant, and one that loved her dearly, as his kind, good, gentle mistress; and who would have gone--yes, and still would go--through any harm to serve her.
If I’m the better for that--and I don’t think I’m the worse--I am grateful to her for it, and love and honour her the more.
Such, however, is the difference between town and country, that nobody took the smallest notice of this insinuating figure; the wretches being wholly engaged in bidding the travellers farewell, in kissing hands to each other, waving handkerchiefs, and the like tame and vulgar practices.
It is very brief.’ Pausing for no reply, he laid his hand on the old gentleman’s sleeve, and proceeded thus: ‘There were once two brothers, who loved each other dearly.
I am not sure but they may insensibly have loved each other the better for that reason.
The deepest and strongest affection of both their hearts settled upon one object.
His brother, patient and considerate in the midst of his own high health and strength, had many and many a day denied himself the sports he loved, to sit beside his couch, telling him old stories till his pale face lighted up with an unwonted glow; to carry him in his arms to some green spot, where he could tend the poor pensive boy as he looked upon the bright summer day, and saw all nature healthy but himself; to be, in any way, his fond and faithful nurse.
I may not dwell on all he did, to make the poor, weak creature love him, or my tale would have no end.
But when the time of trial came, the younger brother’s heart was full of those old days.
‘The elder brother married her.
She grew to womanhood, and gave her heart to one who could not know its worth.
Her fond father could not see her pine and droop.
He joined their hands, and they were married.
Patient, and upheld by strong affection to the last, she died a widow of some three weeks’ date, leaving to her father’s care two orphans; one a son of ten or twelve years old; the other a girl--such another infant child--the same in helplessness, in age, in form, in feature--as she had been herself when her young mother died.
‘It was then, when the love of two dead people who had been nearest and dearest to his heart, was all transferred to this slight creature; when her face, constantly before him, reminded him, from hour to hour, of the too early change he had seen in such another--of all the sufferings he had watched and known, and all his child had undergone; when the young man’s profligate and hardened course drained him of money as his father’s had, and even sometimes occasioned them temporary privation and distress; it was then that there began to beset him, and to be ever in his mind, a gloomy dread of poverty and want.
His voluntary banishment had been misconstrued, and he had borne (not without pain) reproach and slight for doing that which had wrung his heart, and cast a mournful shadow on his path.
With the utmost speed he could exert, he settled his affairs; converted into money all the goods he had; and, with honourable wealth enough for both, with open heart and hand, with limbs that trembled as they bore him on, with emotion such as men can hardly bear and live, arrived one evening at his brother’s door!’ The narrator, whose voice had faltered lately, stopped.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Pray speak to me, whoever that is, awake and up.’ ‘Poor boy!’ said the sexton, before Kit could answer, ‘how goes it, darling?’ ‘Has my dream come true?’ exclaimed the child again, in a voice so fervent that it might have thrilled to the heart of any listener.
Happier than tongue can tell, or heart of man conceive.’ They watched him as he rose and stole on tiptoe to the other chamber where the lamp had been replaced.
‘I love all she loved!’ ‘I know you do,’ returned the schoolmaster.
I think of nothing else.’ ‘I would have you think of nothing else to-night--of nothing but those things which will soften your heart, dear friend, and open it to old affections and old times.
‘It is many years ago, and affliction makes the time longer, but you have not forgotten her whose death contributed to make this child so dear to you, even before you knew her worth or could read her heart?
Say, that you could remember, long ago, another child who loved you dearly, you being but a child yourself.
Say, that you had a brother, long forgotten, long unseen, long separated from you, who now, at last, in your utmost need came back to comfort and console you--’ ‘To be to you what you were once to him,’ cried the younger, falling on his knee before him; ‘to repay your old affection, brother dear, by constant care, solicitude, and love; to be, at your right hand, what he has never ceased to be when oceans rolled between us; to call to witness his unchanging truth and mindfulness of bygone days, whole years of desolation.
Our love and fellowship began in childhood, when life was all before us, and will be resumed when we have proved it, and are but children at the last.
‘You plot among you to wean my heart from her.
‘When I die, put near me something that has loved the light, and had the sky above it always.’ Those were her words.
Her little bird--a poor slight thing the pressure of a finger would have crushed--was stirring nimbly in its cage; and the strong heart of its child mistress was mute and motionless for ever.
Ever and anon he pressed it to his lips; then hugged it to his breast again, murmuring that it was warmer now; and, as he said it, he looked, in agony, to those who stood around, as if imploring them to help her.
‘It is not,’ said the schoolmaster, as he bent down to kiss her on the cheek, and gave his tears free vent, ‘it is not on earth that Heaven’s justice ends.
Opening her eyes at last, from a very quiet sleep, she begged that they would kiss her once again.
She wished there was somebody to take her love to Kit.
Another told, how he had wondered much that one so delicate as she, should be so bold; how she had never feared to enter the church alone at night, but had loved to linger there when all was quiet, and even to climb the tower stair, with no more light than that of the moon rays stealing through the loopholes in the thick old wall.
it is hard to take to heart the lesson that such deaths will teach, but let no man reject it, for it is one that all must learn, and is a mighty, universal Truth.
When Death strikes down the innocent and young, for every fragile form from which he lets the panting spirit free, a hundred virtues rise, in shapes of mercy, charity, and love, to walk the world, and bless it.
With such persuasive words as pity and affection could suggest, they prevailed upon him to sit among them and hear what they should tell him.
If there be any who have never known the blank that follows death--the weary void--the sense of desolation that will come upon the strongest minds, when something familiar and beloved is missed at every turn--the connection between inanimate and senseless things, and the object of recollection, when every household god becomes a monument and every room a grave--if there be any who have not known this, and proved it by their own experience, they can never faintly guess how, for many days, the old man pined and moped away the time, and wandered here and there as seeking something, and had no comfort.
To every endearment and attention he continued listless.
In what hope he lived, no man could tell; but that he had some hope of finding her again--some faint and shadowy hope, deferred from day to day, and making him from day to day more sick and sore at heart--was plain to all.
At times he would suffer the child to walk by his side, or would even take such notice of his presence as giving him his hand, or would stop to kiss his cheek, or pat him on the head.
But, whether alone, or with this pliant friend, or with those who would have given him, at any cost or sacrifice, some consolation or some peace of mind, if happily the means could have been devised; he was at all times the same--with no love or care for anything in life--a broken-hearted man.
They laid him by the side of her whom he had loved so well; and, in the church where they had often prayed, and mused, and lingered hand in hand, the child and the old man slept together.
He was left to be buried with a stake through his heart in the centre of four lonely roads.
He manifested, besides, a strong desire to assault the jury; and being restrained and conducted out of court, darkened its only window by standing on his head upon the sill, until he was dexterously tilted upon his feet again by a cautious beadle.
Having married the first time at her mother’s instigation, she consulted in her second choice nobody but herself.
It fell upon a smart young fellow enough; and as he made it a preliminary condition that Mrs Jiniwin should be thenceforth an out-pensioner, they lived together after marriage with no more than the average amount of quarrelling, and led a merry life upon the dead dwarf’s money.
Unto this ball there happened to be invited the most bashful young lady that was ever seen, with whom Mr Abel happened to fall in love.
But certain it is that in course of time they were married; and equally certain it is that they were the happiest of the happy; and no less certain it is that they deserved to be so.
Then, it occurred to him, but not for the first time, that if she would marry him, how comfortable they might be!
So Richard asked her; whatever she said, it wasn’t No; and they were married in good earnest that day week.
These speculations, however, gave him no uneasiness; for Sophronia was ever a most cheerful, affectionate, and provident wife to him; and Dick (excepting for an occasional outbreak with Mr Chuckster, which she had the good sense rather to encourage than oppose) was to her an attached and domesticated husband.
That friend--single gentleman, or younger brother, which you will--had at his heart a heavy sorrow; but it bred in him no misanthropy or monastic gloom.
He went forth into the world, a lover of his kind.
Did Kit live a single man all his days, or did he marry?
Of course he married, and who should be his wife but Barbara?
And the best of it was, he married so soon that little Jacob was an uncle, before the calves of his legs, already mentioned in this history, had ever been encased in broadcloth pantaloons,--though that was not quite the best either, for of necessity the baby was an uncle too.

&#39;It is another fact, that I am going to be married again.&#39;
&#39;My approaching marriage,&#39; she said, &#39;has one embarrassing circumstance connected with it.
I have innocently robbed her of her lover, and destroyed her prospects in life.
If the letter had left him any hope of being forgiven, I would have positively refused to marry him.
He appealed to my compassion; he appealed to his love for me.
In a week more (I tremble as I think of it) we are to be married.&#39;
It was the woman whom I had robbed of her lover, the woman who had written the noble letter.
I went next to the man whom I am to marry.
&quot;If you refuse to marry me,&quot; he said, &quot;you admit that these reports are true--you admit that you are afraid to face society in the character of my wife.&quot;
He tried vainly to think of her as a person to be pitied--a person with a morbidly sensitive imagination, conscious of the capacities for evil which lie dormant in us all, and striving earnestly to open her heart to the counter-influence of her own better nature; the effort was beyond him.
It was doubtful whether she had ever been married to the Count whose widow she assumed to be.
He was asked derisively what he thought of the circumstances under which the Countess had become engaged to be married; and he made the characteristic answer, that he thought the circumstances highly creditable to both parties, and that he looked on the lady&#39;s future husband as a most enviable man.
Hearing this, the Doctor raised another shout of astonishment by inquiring the name of the gentleman whom the Countess was about to marry.
A man who did not know that the Countess Narona had borrowed money at Homburg of no less a person than Lord Montbarry, and had then deluded him into making her a proposal of marriage, was a man who had probably never heard of Lord Montbarry himself.
Not married.
Will be married next week, Doctor, to the delightful creature we have been talking about.
Heir presumptive, his lordship&#39;s next brother, Stephen Robert, married to Ella, youngest daughter of the Reverend Silas Marden, Rector of Runnigate, and has issue, three daughters.
Sisters of his lordship, Lady Barville, married to Sir Theodore Barville, Bart.
Not one of the five will be present at the marriage; and not one of the five will leave a stone unturned to stop it, if the Countess will only give them a chance.
She was described as being the superior of the Countess in personal attraction, and as being also by some years the younger woman of the two.
Not one of them could call to mind the innumerable instances in which the sexual influence has proved irresistible in the persons of women without even the pretension to beauty.
While the topic of the Countess&#39;s marriage was still the one topic of conversation, a member of the club entered the smoking-room whose appearance instantly produced a dead silence.
Who can say she has a mercenary motive in marrying him?&#39;
&#39;May I ask who made that settlement a condition of the marriage?&#39;
In his leisure moments he found himself wondering whether Lord Montbarry&#39;s family would succeed in stopping the marriage after all.
They were both Roman Catholics, and they were to be married at the chapel in Spanish Place.
On the day of the wedding, after a feeble struggle with himself, he actually sacrificed his patients and their guineas, and slipped away secretly to see the marriage.
Never, on the face of it, was there a less interesting and less romantic marriage than this.
The interval passed, and the married couple, returning to the church, walked together down the nave to the door.
CHAPTER IV On the day of the marriage Agnes Lockwood sat alone in the little drawing-room of her London lodgings, burning the letters which had been written to her by Montbarry in the bygone time.
There were none of the ordinary signs of grief in her face, as she slowly tore the letters of her false lover in two, and threw the pieces into the small fire which had been lit to consume them.
There had been a long past time when Henry Westwick had owned that he loved her.
She had made her confession to him, acknowledging that her heart was given to his eldest brother.
But now, on the very day when his brother&#39;s marriage to another woman had consummated his brother&#39;s treason towards her, there was something vaguely repellent in the prospect of seeing him.
&#39;Is it true,&#39; she asked, after a long silence, &#39;that they have been married to-day?&#39;
He will live to rue the day when he married that woman!&#39;
I was wondering whether anything which has so entirely filled my heart, and so absorbed all that is best and truest in me, as my feeling for your brother, can really pass away as if it had never existed.
Am I as entirely parted from the good and evil fortune of his life as if we had never met and never loved?
She left me, to marry an Italian courier, named Ferrari--and I am afraid it has not turned out very well.
Her face flushed again, and the next instant turned paler than ever; she knew his heart as well as he knew it himself--she was too distressed to speak.
He lifted her hand to his lips, kissed it fervently, and, without looking at her again, left the room.
Am I as entirely parted from the good and evil fortune of his life as if we had never met and never loved?&#39;
But she had loved too faithfully, she had been wounded too deeply, to feel in any adequate degree the influence of the moral remedies which she employed.
&#39;Dear Emily,&#39; and &#39;Yours affectionately&#39;--these conventional phrases, were the only phrases of endearment which they contained.
Agnes handed back the letters--so suggestive of the penalty paid already for his own infatuation by the man who had deserted her!--with feelings of shame and distress, which made her no fit counsellor for the helpless woman who depended on her advice.
Weary and heartsick, Agnes lay down on the sofa, to rest and compose herself.
Have you any friend in that interesting city, with a large heart, and a purse to correspond, who has been let into the secret and who wishes to console you anonymously?&#39;
We will say, then, that Lord Montbarry has presumably been made the victim of a foul wrong--that Mr. Ferrari was the first to find it out--and that the guilty persons had reason to fear, not only that he would acquaint Lord Montbarry with his discovery, but that he would be a principal witness against them if the scandal was made public in a court of law.
Troy permitted his natural kindness of heart to show itself on the surface at last.
One after another, he looked at the objects that reminded him of the woman whom he loved--took them up tenderly--and laid them down again with a sigh.
Miserable, miserable wretch--how she loved him!&#39;
In spite of her resolution, Mrs. Ferrari&#39;s heart beat as if it would burst out of her bosom, when her conductress led her into an ante-room, and knocked at a door opening into a room beyond.
In the one instant while these events passed, timid little Mrs. Ferrari mastered her own throbbing heart; stepped over the threshold, conscious of her clammy hands, dry lips, and burning head; and stood in the presence of Lord Montbarry&#39;s widow, to all outward appearance as supremely self-possessed as her ladyship herself.
Was he married by any chance?
When I first met you, before my marriage, and first felt your influence over me, I had that hope.
Or, if you must think of the time that is passed, can you not look back to the time when I first loved you?&#39;
At that moment he would have given everything he had in the world to take her in his arms and kiss her.
It was impossible that the &#39;change in her life&#39; of which she had spoken could mean that she was about to be married--and yet he was conscious of a perfectly unreasonable reluctance to open the letter.
Your loving Lucy, who writes this.
The children love me; the mother loves me; the father has shown me innumerable instances of his true friendship and regard.
I believe they have courage enough and heart enough to say Yes.&#39;
While her heart was empty, her heart was accessible.
&#39;He would never have heart enough to remember them himself!&#39;
when I go to bid her good-night, she&#39;ll give me a big kiss, poor dear--and say, Nurse, I didn&#39;t mean it!
If I lost it all to-morrow, I shouldn&#39;t break my heart; I&#39;m well enough off, as it is, for the rest of my days.
She was to visit the Westwicks for a month--and, if she really liked teaching the children, she was then to be governess, aunt, and cousin, all in one--and was only to go away in an event which her friends in Ireland persisted in contemplating, the event of her marriage.
Henry tried to kiss her at parting.
Her refusal to grant him his privilege as a cousin was a good sign--it was indirectly an act of encouragement to him in the character of her lover.
Stephen and I have arranged to call her by her foreign title, before she was married.
</pre></div>

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Are you aware that he is married?&#39;
&#39;Are you in love with Miss Haldane already?&#39;
She was, it is needless to say, perfectly well aware that he was in love with her, while he was himself modestly reticent on the subject--so far as words went.
They had themselves married early in life--and, strange to say, they did not object on principle to the early marriages of other people.
The question of age being thus disposed of, the course of true love had no other obstacles to encounter.
CHAPTER XV (MISS AGNES LOCKWOOD TO MRS. FERRARI) &#39;I promised to give you some account, dear Emily, of the marriage of Mr. Arthur Barville and Miss Haldane.
If you add to the persons whom I have already mentioned, the elder members of Mrs. Carbury&#39;s family, and the old servants in both houses--privileged to drink the healths of the married pair at the lower end of the room--you will have the list of the company at the wedding-breakfast complete.
What do you say (if you have no engagements that will prevent it) to joining our young married friends before the close of their tour, and renewing the social success of this delightful breakfast by another festival in honour of the honeymoon?
Your affectionate friend, Adela Montbarry.&#39;
Pondering over a new form of theatrical attraction for the coming winter season, Francis had determined to revive the languid public taste for the ballet by means of an entertainment of his own invention, combining dramatic interest with dancing.
Can such a woman as Agnes give her love or refuse it, according to circumstances?
If you really love her, wait; and trust to your two best friends--to time and to me.
She was more interested in meeting the young married couple than in awaiting the result of the hard bargaining which delayed the engagement of the new dancer; and she volunteered to make her brother&#39;s apologies, if his theatrical business caused him to be late in keeping his appointment at the honeymoon festival.
In the old times, she had been noted in the family as the one member of it who lived on affectionate terms with Montbarry.
My little loves, do you sniff a nasty smell here--ha?&#39;
Call me by my name before I committed the fatal mistake of marrying your brother.
&#39;She was nearer to the heart of the Montbarry who is dead than any of you,&#39; the Countess answered sternly.
With her heart in the tomb of the dead Montbarry, could Agnes even think of another man, and think of love?
Her head was in a whirl; her heart beat furiously, without any assignable cause.
In the moment when she turned, the chill of a sudden terror gripped her round the heart, as with the clasp of an icy hand.
The old ardour and impetuosity were nearly worn out.
But I feel in my heart of hearts that you are deceived.
&#39;Agnes,&#39; he said, &#39;are you beginning to understand how truly I love you?&#39;
That simple question found its own way to her heart.
he whispered--and kissed her.
To one of these reports (which falsely and abominably points to the Baron as her lover instead of her brother) she now refers with just indignation.
Take your choice, between marrying my Lord&#39;s income, in the interest of my grand discovery--or leave me to sell myself and my title to the first rich woman of low degree who is ready to buy me.&quot;
Take five minutes to consider what I have said to you, and tell me on my return which of us is to marry for the money I want, you or I.&quot;
Take as stepping-stones on the way to your triumph, my love, my liberty, and my life!&quot;
Henry paused between the First and Second Acts; reflecting, not on the merits of the play, but on the strange resemblance which the incidents so far presented to the incidents that had attended the disastrous marriage of the first Lord Montbarry.
The Countess has sacrificed herself; the mercenary marriage has taken place--but not without obstacles, caused by difference of opinion on the question of marriage settlements.
&quot;Let us by all means&quot; (he says) &quot;consider the marriage as broken off.&quot;
My lord is in love; the natural result follows--he gives way.
But my Lord&#39;s turn comes, when the marriage has been celebrated, and when the honeymoon is over.
The Baron has joined the married pair at a palace which they have hired in Venice.
She can only answer that her noble husband (being no longer distractedly in love with her) now appears in his true character, as one of the meanest men living.
The sacrifice of the marriage has been made, and has already proved useless.
He closed the manuscript, heartsick and exhausted, and threw himself on his bed to rest.
&#39;But if you will be guided by me, spare yourself the reading of those pages to come, which describe our brother&#39;s terrible expiation of his heartless marriage.&#39;
My wife has committed a breach of confidence--I believe Agnes will marry you.
In the spring of the new year, the marriage took place.
During the last few days of the residence of the newly married couple by the riverside, Lady Montbarry&#39;s children were invited to enjoy a day&#39;s play in the garden.
&#39;Henry, I want you to give me a kiss.&#39;

Here and there is born a Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose loving heart-beats and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are dispersed among hindrances, instead of centring in some long-recognizable deed.
Dorothea knew many passages of Pascal’s Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart; and to her the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity, made the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for Bedlam.
Her mind was theoretic, and yearned by its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might frankly include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there; she was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing whatever seemed to her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom, to make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after all in a quarter where she had not sought it.
Certainly such elements in the character of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot, and hinder it from being decided according to custom, by good looks, vanity, and merely canine affection.
She was regarded as an heiress; for not only had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their parents, but if Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke’s estate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year—a rental which seemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel’s late conduct on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and of that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities of genteel life.
And how should Dorothea not marry?—a girl so handsome and with such prospects?
Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes, and her insistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a wary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might lead her at last to refuse all offers.
She loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the country, and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she looked very little like a devotee.
She was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it was pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with attractions altogether superior to her own, and if any gentleman appeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of seeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded that he must be in love with Celia: Sir James Chettam, for example, whom she constantly considered from Celia’s point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be good for Celia to accept him.
That he should be regarded as a suitor to herself would have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance.
Dorothea, with all her eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas about marriage.
She felt sure that she would have accepted the judicious Hooker, if she had been born in time to save him from that wretched mistake he made in matrimony; or John Milton when his blindness had come on; or any of the other great men whose odd habits it would have been glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome baronet, who said “Exactly” to her remarks even when she expressed uncertainty,—how could he affect her as a lover?
The really delightful marriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father, and could teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it.
Across all her imaginative adornment of those whom she loved, there darted now and then a keen discernment, which was not without a scorching quality.
Sometimes, indeed, she had reflected that Dodo would perhaps not make a husband happy who had not her way of looking at things; and stifled in the depths of her heart was the feeling that her sister was too religious for family comfort.
As to the excessive religiousness alleged against Miss Brooke, he had a very indefinite notion of what it consisted in, and thought that it would die out with marriage.
In short, he felt himself to be in love in the right place, and was ready to endure a great deal of predominance, which, after all, a man could always put down when he liked.
Dorothea’s inferences may seem large; but really life could never have gone on at any period but for this liberal allowance of conclusions, which has facilitated marriage under the difficulties of civilization.
I am sure her reasons would do her honor.” He was not in the least jealous of the interest with which Dorothea had looked up at Mr. Casaubon: it never occurred to him that a girl to whom he was meditating an offer of marriage could care for a dried bookworm towards fifty, except, indeed, in a religious sort of way, as for a clergyman of some distinction.
A learned provincial clergyman is accustomed to think of his acquaintances as of “lords, knyghtes, and other noble and worthi men, that conne Latyn but lytille.” Dorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this conception.
All people, young or old (that is, all people in those ante-reform times), would have thought her an interesting object if they had referred the glow in her eyes and cheeks to the newly awakened ordinary images of young love: the illusions of Chloe about Strephon have been sufficiently consecrated in poetry, as the pathetic loveliness of all spontaneous trust ought to be.
Miss Pippin adoring young Pumpkin, and dreaming along endless vistas of unwearying companionship, was a little drama which never tired our fathers and mothers, and had been put into all costumes.
But perhaps no persons then living—certainly none in the neighborhood of Tipton—would have had a sympathetic understanding for the dreams of a girl whose notions about marriage took their color entirely from an exalted enthusiasm about the ends of life, an enthusiasm which was lit chiefly by its own fire, and included neither the niceties of the trousseau, the pattern of plate, nor even the honors and sweet joys of the blooming matron.
With some endowment of stupidity and conceit, she might have thought that a Christian young lady of fortune should find her ideal of life in village charities, patronage of the humbler clergy, the perusal of “Female Scripture Characters,” unfolding the private experience of Sara under the Old Dispensation, and Dorcas under the New, and the care of her soul over her embroidery in her own boudoir—with a background of prospective marriage to a man who, if less strict than herself, as being involved in affairs religiously inexplicable, might be prayed for and seasonably exhorted.
It would be like marrying Pascal.
When Tantripp was brushing my hair the other day, she said that Sir James’s man knew from Mrs. Cadwallader’s maid that Sir James was to marry the eldest Miss Brooke.” “How can you let Tantripp talk such gossip to you, Celia?” said Dorothea, indignantly, not the less angry because details asleep in her memory were now awakened to confirm the unwelcome revelation.
Every one can see that Sir James is very much in love with you.” The revulsion was so strong and painful in Dorothea’s mind that the tears welled up and flowed abundantly.
All her dear plans were embittered, and she thought with disgust of Sir James’s conceiving that she recognized him as her lover.
“Well, my dears,” he said, kindly, as they went up to kiss him, “I hope nothing disagreeable has happened while I have been away.” “No, uncle,” said Celia, “we have been to Freshitt to look at the cottages.
However, the long and the short of it is, that he has asked my permission to make you an offer of marriage—of marriage, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with his explanatory nod.
People should have their own way in marriage, and that sort of thing—up to a certain point, you know.
I wish you to marry well; and I have good reason to believe that Chettam wishes to marry you.
I mention it, you know.” “It is impossible that I should ever marry Sir James Chettam,” said Dorothea.
“If he thinks of marrying me, he has made a great mistake.” “That is it, you see.
I never married myself, and it will be the better for you and yours.
The fact is, I never loved any one well enough to put myself into a noose for them.
Think about it, you know.” When Dorothea had left him, he reflected that he had certainly spoken strongly: he had put the risks of marriage before her in a striking manner.
But as to pretending to be wise for young people,—no uncle, however much he had travelled in his youth, absorbed the new ideas, and dined with celebrities now deceased, could pretend to judge what sort of marriage would turn out well for a young girl who preferred Casaubon to Chettam.
MY DEAR MISS BROOKE,—I have your guardian’s permission to address you on a subject than which I have none more at heart.
In return I can at least offer you an affection hitherto unwasted, and the faithful consecration of a life which, however short in the sequel, has no backward pages whereon, if you choose to turn them, you will find records such as might justly cause you either bitterness or shame.
How could it occur to her to examine the letter, to look at it critically as a profession of love?
MY DEAR MR. CASAUBON,—I am very grateful to you for loving me, and thinking me worthy to be your wife.
I had it myself—that love of knowledge, and going into everything—a little too much—it took me too far; though that sort of thing doesn’t often run in the female-line; or it runs underground like the rivers in Greece, you know—it comes out in the sons.
Now, though they had hardly spoken to each other all the evening, yet when Celia put by her work, intending to go to bed, a proceeding in which she was always much the earlier, Dorothea, who was seated on a low stool, unable to occupy herself except in meditation, said, with the musical intonation which in moments of deep but quiet feeling made her speech like a fine bit of recitative— “Celia, dear, come and kiss me,” holding her arms open as she spoke.
Celia knelt down to get the right level and gave her little butterfly kiss, while Dorothea encircled her with gentle arms and pressed her lips gravely on each cheek in turn.
Not that she now imagined Mr. Casaubon to be already an accepted lover: she had only begun to feel disgust at the possibility that anything in Dorothea’s mind could tend towards such an issue.
Here was something really to vex her about Dodo: it was all very well not to accept Sir James Chettam, but the idea of marrying Mr. Casaubon!
“It is right to tell you, Celia, that I am engaged to marry Mr. Casaubon.” Perhaps Celia had never turned so pale before.
“Oh, Dodo, I hope you will be happy.” Her sisterly tenderness could not but surmount other feelings at this moment, and her fears were the fears of affection.
Of course all the world round Tipton would be out of sympathy with this marriage.
at this childlike unrestrained ardor: he was not surprised (what lover would have been?)
That I should ever meet with a mind and person so rich in the mingled graces which could render marriage desirable, was far indeed from my conception.
The great charm of your sex is its capability of an ardent self-sacrificing affection, and herein we see its fitness to round and complete the existence of our own.
I have been little disposed to gather flowers that would wither in my hand, but now I shall pluck them with eagerness, to place them in your bosom.” No speech could have been more thoroughly honest in its intention: the frigid rhetoric at the end was as sincere as the bark of a dog, or the cawing of an amorous rook.
I shall gain enough if you will take me with you there.” “How should I be able now to persevere in any path without your companionship?” said Mr. Casaubon, kissing her candid brow, and feeling that heaven had vouchsafed him a blessing in every way suited to his peculiar wants.
It was this which made Dorothea so childlike, and, according to some judges, so stupid, with all her reputed cleverness; as, for example, in the present case of throwing herself, metaphorically speaking, at Mr. Casaubon’s feet, and kissing his unfashionable shoe-ties as if he were a Protestant Pope.
Before he left the next day it had been decided that the marriage should take place within six weeks.
who are going to marry your niece, as good as your daughter, to one of our best men.
“I hope Chettam and I shall always be good friends; but I am sorry to say there is no prospect of his marrying my niece,” said Mr. Brooke, much relieved to see through the window that Celia was coming in.
Your sex is capricious, you know.” “Why, whom do you mean to say that you are going to let her marry?” Mrs. Cadwallader’s mind was rapidly surveying the possibilities of choice for Dorothea.
“She is engaged to marry Mr. Casaubon,” said Celia, resorting, as usual, to the simplest statement of fact, and enjoying this opportunity of speaking to the Rector’s wife alone.
They are to be married in six weeks.” “Well, my dear, I wish you joy of your brother-in-law.” “I am so sorry for Dorothea.” “Sorry!
It is her doing, I suppose.” “Yes; she says Mr. Casaubon has a great soul.” “With all my heart.” “Oh, Mrs. Cadwallader, I don’t think it can be nice to marry a man with a great soul.” “Well, my dear, take warning.
You know the look of one now; when the next comes and wants to marry you, don’t you accept him.” “I’m sure I never should.” “No; one such in a family is enough.
Young people should think of their families in marrying.
Lady Chettam had not yet returned, but Mrs. Cadwallader’s errand could not be despatched in the presence of grooms, so she asked to be taken into the conservatory close by, to look at the new plants; and on coming to a contemplative stand, she said— “I have a great shock for you; I hope you are not so far gone in love as you pretended to be.” It was of no use protesting against Mrs. Cadwallader’s way of putting things.
“What business has an old bachelor like that to marry?” said Sir James.
For this marriage to Casaubon is as good as going to a nunnery.” “Oh, on my own account—it is for Miss Brooke’s sake I think her friends should try to use their influence.” “Well, Humphrey doesn’t know yet.
The truth is, you have been courting one and have won the other.
Now, why on earth should Mrs. Cadwallader have been at all busy about Miss Brooke’s marriage; and why, when one match that she liked to think she had a hand in was frustrated, should she have straightway contrived the preliminaries of another?
All the more did the affairs of the great world interest her, when communicated in the letters of high-born relations: the way in which fascinating younger sons had gone to the dogs by marrying their mistresses; the fine old-blooded idiocy of young Lord Tapir, and the furious gouty humors of old Lord Megatherium; the exact crossing of genealogies which had brought a coronet into a new branch and widened the relations of scandal,—these were topics of which she retained details with the utmost accuracy, and reproduced them in an excellent pickle of epigrams, which she herself enjoyed the more because she believed as unquestionably in birth and no-birth as she did in game and vermin.
From the first arrival of the young ladies in Tipton she had prearranged Dorothea’s marriage with Sir James, and if it had taken place would have been quite sure that it was her doing: that it should not take place after she had preconceived it, caused her an irritation which every thinker will sympathize with.
“However,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, first to herself and afterwards to her husband, “I throw her over: there was a chance, if she had married Sir James, of her becoming a sane, sensible woman.
But now I wish her joy of her hair shirt.” It followed that Mrs. Cadwallader must decide on another match for Sir James, and having made up her mind that it was to be the younger Miss Brooke, there could not have been a more skilful move towards the success of her plan than her hint to the baronet that he had made an impression on Celia’s heart.
On the contrary, having the amiable vanity which knits us to those who are fond of us, and disinclines us to those who are indifferent, and also a good grateful nature, the mere idea that a woman had a kindness towards him spun little threads of tenderness from out his heart towards hers.
Mr. Casaubon, as might be expected, spent a great deal of his time at the Grange in these weeks, and the hindrance which courtship occasioned to the progress of his great work—the Key to all Mythologies—naturally made him look forward the more eagerly to the happy termination of courtship.
Nevertheless, he observed with pleasure that Miss Brooke showed an ardent submissive affection which promised to fulfil his most agreeable previsions of marriage.
“Could I not be preparing myself now to be more useful?” said Dorothea to him, one morning, early in the time of courtship; “could I not learn to read Latin and Greek aloud to you, as Milton’s daughters did to their father, without understanding what they read?” “I fear that would be wearisome to you,” said Mr. Casaubon, smiling; “and, indeed, if I remember rightly, the young women you have mentioned regarded that exercise in unknown tongues as a ground for rebellion against the poet.” “Yes; but in the first place they were very naughty girls, else they would have been proud to minister to such a father; and in the second place they might have studied privately and taught themselves to understand what they read, and then it would have been interesting.
However, Mr. Casaubon consented to listen and teach for an hour together, like a schoolmaster of little boys, or rather like a lover, to whom a mistress’s elementary ignorance and difficulties have a touching fitness.
“Casaubon, she will be in your hands now: you must teach my niece to take things more quietly, eh, Dorothea?” He ended with a smile, not wishing to hurt his niece, but really thinking that it was perhaps better for her to be early married to so sober a fellow as Casaubon, since she would not hear of Chettam.
Something might be done perhaps even now, at least to defer the marriage.
“I mean this marriage.
I mean his letting that blooming young girl marry Casaubon.” “What is the matter with Casaubon?
I wonder a man like you, Cadwallader—a man with daughters, can look at the affair with indifference: and with such a heart as yours!
She has been wanting me to go and lecture Brooke; and I have reminded her that her friends had a very poor opinion of the match she made when she married me.” “But look at Casaubon,” said Sir James, indignantly.
Elinor used to tell her sisters that she married me for my ugliness—it was so various and amusing that it had quite conquered her prudence.” “You!
it was easy enough for a woman to love you.
At last he said— “Now, Cadwallader, has he got any heart?” “Well, yes.
I should feel just the same if I were Miss Brooke’s brother or uncle.” “Well, but what should you do?” “I should say that the marriage must not be decided on until she was of age.
Brooke is a very good fellow, but pulpy; he will run into any mould, but he won’t keep shape.” “He might keep shape long enough to defer the marriage,” said Sir James.
You have nothing to say to each other.” “What has that to do with Miss Brooke’s marrying him?
“Why does he not bring out his book, instead of marrying,” said Sir James, with a disgust which he held warranted by the sound feeling of an English layman.
Clearly, there would be no interference with Miss Brooke’s marriage through Mr. Cadwallader; and Sir James felt with some sadness that she was to have perfect liberty of misjudgment.
She was now enough aware of Sir James’s position with regard to her, to appreciate the rectitude of his perseverance in a landlord’s duty, to which he had at first been urged by a lover’s complaisance, and her pleasure in it was great enough to count for something even in her present happiness.
Mr. Casaubon’s behavior about settlements was highly satisfactory to Mr. Brooke, and the preliminaries of marriage rolled smoothly along, shortening the weeks of courtship.
A woman dictates before marriage in order that she may have an appetite for submission afterwards.
And there are many blanks left in the weeks of courtship which a loving faith fills with happy assurance.
“My aunt made an unfortunate marriage.
Ladislaw had made up his mind that she must be an unpleasant girl, since she was going to marry Casaubon, and what she said of her stupidity about pictures would have confirmed that opinion even if he had believed her.
There could be no sort of passion in a girl who would marry Casaubon.
Partly it was the reception of his own artistic production that tickled him; partly the notion of his grave cousin as the lover of that girl; and partly Mr. Brooke’s definition of the place he might have held but for the impediment of indolence.
We should be very patient with each other, I think.” “I suppose it is being engaged to be married that has made you think patience good,” said Celia, as soon as she and Dorothea were alone together, taking off their wrappings.
Suppose we turn from outside estimates of a man, to wonder, with keener interest, what is the report of his own consciousness about his doings or capacity: with what hindrances he is carrying on his daily labors; what fading of hopes, or what deeper fixity of self-delusion the years are marking off within him; and with what spirit he wrestles against universal pressure, which will one day be too heavy for him, and bring his heart to its final pause.
Certainly this affair of his marriage with Miss Brooke touched him more nearly than it did any one of the persons who have hitherto shown their disapproval of it, and in the present stage of things I feel more tenderly towards his experience of success than towards the disappointment of the amiable Sir James.
For in truth, as the day fixed for his marriage came nearer, Mr. Casaubon did not find his spirits rising; nor did the contemplation of that matrimonial garden scene, where, as all experience showed, the path was to be bordered with flowers, prove persistently more enchanting to him than the accustomed vaults where he walked taper in hand.
He could not but wish that Dorothea should think him not less happy than the world would expect her successful suitor to be; and in relation to his authorship he leaned on her young trust and veneration, he liked to draw forth her fresh interest in listening, as a means of encouragement to himself: in talking to her he presented all his performance and intention with the reflected confidence of the pedagogue, and rid himself for the time of that chilling ideal audience which crowded his laborious uncreative hours with the vaporous pressure of Tartarean shades.
Casaubon would tell her all that: she was looking forward to higher initiation in ideas, as she was looking forward to marriage, and blending her dim conceptions of both.
Thus in these brief weeks Dorothea’s joyous grateful expectation was unbroken, and however her lover might occasionally be conscious of flatness, he could never refer it to any slackening of her affectionate interest.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>If I were a marrying man I should choose Miss Vincy before either of them.” “Well, make up, make up,” said Mr. Standish, jocosely; “you see the middle-aged fellows carry the day.” Mr. Chichely shook his head with much meaning: he was not going to incur the certainty of being accepted by the woman he would choose.
He had quitted the party early, and would have thought it altogether tedious but for the novelty of certain introductions, especially the introduction to Miss Brooke, whose youthful bloom, with her approaching marriage to that faded scholar, and her interest in matters socially useful, gave her the piquancy of an unusual combination.
Lydgate, in fact, was already conscious of being fascinated by a woman strikingly different from Miss Brooke: he did not in the least suppose that he had lost his balance and fallen in love, but he had said of that particular woman, “She is grace itself; she is perfectly lovely and accomplished.
But Rosamond Vincy seemed to have the true melodic charm; and when a man has seen the woman whom he would have chosen if he had intended to marry speedily, his remaining a bachelor will usually depend on her resolution rather than on his.
Lydgate believed that he should not marry for several years: not marry until he had trodden out a good clear path for himself away from the broad road which was quite ready made.
He had seen Miss Vincy above his horizon almost as long as it had taken Mr. Casaubon to become engaged and married: but this learned gentleman was possessed of a fortune; he had assembled his voluminous notes, and had made that sort of reputation which precedes performance,—often the larger part of a man’s fame.
You will be married some day.” “Not to any one who is like Fred.” “Don’t decry your own brother, my dear.
“But I shall not marry any Middlemarch young man.” “So it seems, my love, for you have as good as refused the pick of them; and if there’s better to be had, I’m sure there’s no girl better deserves it.” “Excuse me, mamma—I wish you would not say, ‘the pick of them.’” “Why, what else are they?” “I mean, mamma, it is rather a vulgar expression.” “Very likely, my dear; I never was a good speaker.
“Well, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, wheeling skilfully, “if she _had_ some fortune left her,—a man marries his wife’s relations, and the Garths are so poor, and live in such a small way.
And you play so out of tune.” “When next any one makes love to you, Miss Rosamond, I will tell him how obliging you are.” “Why should you expect me to oblige you by hearing you play the flute, any more than I should expect you to oblige me by not playing it?” “And why should you expect me to take you out riding?” This question led to an adjustment, for Rosamond had set her mind on that particular ride.
These are the things that make the gamut of joy in landscape to midland-bred souls—the things they toddled among, or perhaps learned by heart standing between their father’s knees while he drove leisurely.
I mean, there is a gentleman who may fall in love with you, seeing you almost every day.” A certain change in Mary’s face was chiefly determined by the resolve not to show any change.
“Does that always make people fall in love?” she answered, carelessly; “it seems to me quite as often a reason for detesting each other.” “Not when they are interesting and agreeable.
I should not like to marry a clergyman; but there must be clergymen.” “It does not follow that Fred must be one.” “But when papa has been at the expense of educating him for it!
“If your mamma is afraid that Fred will make me an offer, tell her that I would not marry him if he asked me.
Speak up for your sister.” “I’m afraid I’m out of court, sir.
Yet this result, which she took to be a mutual impression, called falling in love, was just what Rosamond had contemplated beforehand.
And a stranger was absolutely necessary to Rosamond’s social romance, which had always turned on a lover and bridegroom who was not a Middlemarcher, and who had no connections at all like her own: of late, indeed, the construction seemed to demand that he should somehow be related to a baronet.
She judged of her own symptoms as those of awakening love, and she held it still more natural that Mr. Lydgate should have fallen in love at first sight of her.
Rosamond, though no older than Mary, was rather used to being fallen in love with; but she, for her part, had remained indifferent and fastidiously critical towards both fresh sprig and faded bachelor.
She is the best girl I know.” “I should never have thought she was a girl to fall in love with.” “How do you know what men would fall in love with?
Girls never know.” “At least, Fred, let me advise _you_ not to fall in love with her, for she says she would not marry you if you asked her.” “She might have waited till I did ask her.” “I knew it would nettle you, Fred.” “Not at all.
But this proud openness was made lovable by an expression of unaffected good-will.
Now a point which I have much at heart to secure is a new regulation as to clerical attendance at the old infirmary.
“And when you married Harriet, I don’t see how you could expect that our families should not hang by the same nail.
I promise nothing—I shall make codicils as long as I like—_and that considering the nature of such a proceeding, it is unreasonable to presume that a young man of sense and character would attempt it_—ah, but the gentleman doesn’t say you are a young man of sense and character, mark you that, sir!—_As to my own concern with any report of such a nature, I distinctly affirm that I never made any statement to the effect that your son had borrowed money on any property that might accrue to him on Mr. Featherstone’s demise_—bless my heart!
He held himself to be a gentleman at heart, and did not like courting an old fellow for his money.
I think he is in love with you.” “I am not aware of it.
And to me it is one of the most odious things in a girl’s life, that there must always be some supposition of falling in love coming between her and any man who is kind to her, and to whom she is grateful.
I have no ground for the nonsensical vanity of fancying everybody who comes near me is in love with me.” Mary did not mean to betray any feeling, but in spite of herself she ended in a tremulous tone of vexation.
“I suppose a woman is never in love with any one she has always known—ever since she can remember; as a man often is.
But then Ophelia had probably known Hamlet a long while; and Brenda Troil—she had known Mordaunt Merton ever since they were children; but then he seems to have been an estimable young man; and Minna was still more deeply in love with Cleveland, who was a stranger.
Waverley was new to Flora MacIvor; but then she did not fall in love with him.
And there are Olivia and Sophia Primrose, and Corinne—they may be said to have fallen in love with new men.
He was certainly an affectionate fellow, and as he had grown from boy to man, he had grown in love with his old playmate, notwithstanding that share in the higher education of the country which had exalted his views of rank and income.
“When a man is not loved, it is no use for him to say that he could be a better fellow—could do anything—I mean, if he were sure of being loved in return.” “Not of the least use in the world for him to say he _could_ be better.
Might, could, would—they are contemptible auxiliaries.” “I don’t see how a man is to be good for much unless he has some one woman to love him dearly.” “I think the goodness should come before he expects that.” “You know better, Mary.
Women don’t love men for their goodness.” “Perhaps not.
But if they love them, they never think them bad.” “It is hardly fair to say I am bad.” “I said nothing at all about you.” “I never shall be good for anything, Mary, if you will not say that you love me—if you will not promise to marry me—I mean, when I am able to marry.” “If I did love you, I would not marry you: I would certainly not promise ever to marry you.” “I think that is quite wicked, Mary.
If you love me, you ought to promise to marry me.” “On the contrary, I think it would be wicked in me to marry you even if I did love you.” “You mean, just as I am, without any means of maintaining a wife.
Like many a plucked idle young gentleman, he was thoroughly in love, and with a plain girl, who had no money!
For surely all must admit that a man may be puffed and belauded, envied, ridiculed, counted upon as a tool and fallen in love with, or at least selected as a future husband, and yet remain virtually unknown—known merely as a cluster of signs for his neighbors’ false suppositions.
Most of us who turn to any subject with love remember some morning or evening hour when we got on a high stool to reach down an untried volume, or sat with parted lips listening to a new talker, or for very lack of books began to listen to the voices within, as the first traceable beginning of our love.
The page he opened on was under the head of Anatomy, and the first passage that drew his eyes was on the valves of the heart.
We are not afraid of telling over and over again how a man comes to fall in love with a woman and be wedded to her, or else be fatally parted from her.
In the story of this passion, too, the development varies: sometimes it is the glorious marriage, sometimes frustration and final parting.
The story of their coming to be shapen after the average and fit to be packed by the gross, is hardly ever told even in their consciousness; for perhaps their ardor in generous unpaid toil cooled as imperceptibly as the ardor of other youthful loves, till one day their earlier self walked like a ghost in its old home and made the new furniture ghastly.
There was another attraction in his profession: it wanted reform, and gave a man an opportunity for some indignant resolve to reject its venal decorations and other humbug, and to be the possessor of genuine though undemanded qualifications.
That great Frenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies, fundamentally considered, are not associations of organs which can be understood by studying them first apart, and then as it were federally; but must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues, out of which the various organs—brain, heart, lungs, and so on—are compacted, as the various accommodations of a house are built up in various proportions of wood, iron, stone, brick, zinc, and the rest, each material having its peculiar composition and proportions.
Of this sequence to Bichat’s work, already vibrating along many currents of the European mind, Lydgate was enamoured; he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of living structure, and help to define men’s thought more accurately after the true order.
says a young lady enamoured of that careless grace.
As to women, he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous folly, which he meant to be final, since marriage at some distant period would of course not be impetuous.
For those who want to be acquainted with Lydgate it will be good to know what was that case of impetuous folly, for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving of passion to which he was prone, together with the chivalrous kindness which helped to make him morally lovable.
One evening, tired with his experimenting, and not being able to elicit the facts he needed, he left his frogs and rabbits to some repose under their trying and mysterious dispensation of unexplained shocks, and went to finish his evening at the theatre of the Porte Saint Martin, where there was a melodrama which he had already seen several times; attracted, not by the ingenious work of the collaborating authors, but by an actress whose part it was to stab her lover, mistaking him for the evil-designing duke of the piece.
Lydgate was in love with this actress, as a man is in love with a woman whom he never expects to speak to.
She had but lately come to Paris, and bore a virtuous reputation, her husband acting with her as the unfortunate lover.
At the moment when the heroine was to act the stabbing of her lover, and he was to fall gracefully, the wife veritably stabbed her husband, who fell as death willed.
Lydgate was madly anxious about her affection, and jealous lest any other man than himself should win it and ask her to marry him.
But instead of reopening her engagement at the Porte Saint Martin, where she would have been all the more popular for the fatal episode, she left Paris without warning, forsaking her little court of admirers.
He spoke to her after the play, was received with the usual quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water, and obtained leave to visit her the next day; when he was bent on telling her that he adored her, and on asking her to marry him.
You are lonely; I love you; I want you to consent to be my wife; I will wait, but I want you to promise that you will marry me—no one else.” Laure looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from under her grand eyelids, until he was full of rapturous certainty, and knelt close to her knees.
He was saved from hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his heart and his belief that human life might be made better.
“All that in woman is adored In thy fair self I find— For the whole sex can but afford The handsome and the kind.” —SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.
She resigned no domestic function to her daughter; and the matron’s blooming good-natured face, with the two volatile pink strings floating from her fine throat, and her cheery manners to husband and children, was certainly among the great attractions of the Vincy house—attractions which made it all the easier to fall in love with the daughter.
He could not marry yet; he wished not to marry for several years; and therefore he was not ready to entertain the notion of being in love with a girl whom he happened to admire.
Certainly, if falling in love had been at all in question, it would have been quite safe with a creature like this Miss Vincy, who had just the kind of intelligence one would desire in a woman—polished, refined, docile, lending itself to finish in all the delicacies of life, and enshrined in a body which expressed this with a force of demonstration that excluded the need for other evidence.
Lydgate felt sure that if ever he married, his wife would have that feminine radiance, that distinctive womanhood which must be classed with flowers and music, that sort of beauty which by its very nature was virtuous, being moulded only for pure and delicate joys.
But since he did not mean to marry for the next five years—his more pressing business was to look into Louis’ new book on Fever, which he was specially interested in, because he had known Louis in Paris, and had followed many anatomical demonstrations in order to ascertain the specific differences of typhus and typhoid.
He went home and read far into the smallest hour, bringing a much more testing vision of details and relations into this pathological study than he had ever thought it necessary to apply to the complexities of love and marriage, these being subjects on which he felt himself amply informed by literature, and that traditional wisdom which is handed down in the genial conversation of men.
He for his part had tossed away all cheap inventions where ignorance finds itself able and at ease: he was enamoured of that arduous invention which is the very eye of research, provisionally framing its object and correcting it to more and more exactness of relation; he wanted to pierce the obscurity of those minute processes which prepare human misery and joy, those invisible thoroughfares which are the first lurking-places of anguish, mania, and crime, that delicate poise and transition which determine the growth of happy or unhappy consciousness.
He was an ardent fellow, but at present his ardor was absorbed in love of his work and in the ambition of making his life recognized as a factor in the better life of mankind—like other heroes of science who had nothing but an obscure country practice to begin with.
It had not occurred to Lydgate that he had been a subject of eager meditation to Rosamond, who had neither any reason for throwing her marriage into distant perspective, nor any pathological studies to divert her mind from that ruminating habit, that inward repetition of looks, words, and phrases, which makes a large part in the lives of most girls.
In Rosamond’s romance it was not necessary to imagine much about the inward life of the hero, or of his serious business in the world: of course, he had a profession and was clever, as well as sufficiently handsome; but the piquant fact about Lydgate was his good birth, which distinguished him from all Middlemarch admirers, and presented marriage as a prospect of rising in rank and getting a little nearer to that celestial condition on earth in which she would have nothing to do with vulgar people, and perhaps at last associate with relatives quite equal to the county people who looked down on the Middlemarchers.
If you think it incredible that to imagine Lydgate as a man of family could cause thrills of satisfaction which had anything to do with the sense that she was in love with him, I will ask you to use your power of comparison a little more effectively, and consider whether red cloth and epaulets have never had an influence of that sort.
Rosamond, in fact, was entirely occupied not exactly with Tertius Lydgate as he was in himself, but with his relation to her; and it was excusable in a girl who was accustomed to hear that all young men might, could, would be, or actually were in love with her, to believe at once that Lydgate could be no exception.
She found time also to read the best novels, and even the second best, and she knew much poetry by heart.
But Mrs. Plymdale thought that Rosamond had been educated to a ridiculous pitch, for what was the use of accomplishments which would be all laid aside as soon as she was married?
In short, it was plain that a vicar might be adored by his womankind as the king of men and preachers, and yet be held by them to stand in much need of their direction.
He is practising at a German bath, and has married a rich patient.” “Then my notions wear the best, so far,” said Lydgate, with a short scornful laugh.
“The shortest way is to make your value felt, so that people must put up with you whether you flatter them or not.” “With all my heart.
“Confound their petty politics!” was one of his thoughts for three mornings in the meditative process of shaving, when he had begun to feel that he must really hold a court of conscience on this matter.

Romanticism, which has helped to fill some dull blanks with love and knowledge, had not yet penetrated the times with its leaven and entered into everybody’s food; it was fermenting still as a distinguishable vigorous enthusiasm in certain long-haired German artists at Rome, and the youth of other nations who worked or idled near them were sometimes caught in the spreading movement.
However, she is married; I saw her wedding-ring on that wonderful left hand, otherwise I should have thought the sallow _Geistlicher_ was her father.
Do you know her?” “I know that she is married to my cousin,” said Will Ladislaw, sauntering down the hall with a preoccupied air, while his German friend kept at his side and watched him eagerly.
They were not married then.
I am sorry to add that she was sobbing bitterly, with such abandonment to this relief of an oppressed heart as a woman habitually controlled by pride on her own account and thoughtfulness for others will sometimes allow herself when she feels securely alone.
She had married the man of her choice, and with the advantage over most girls that she had contemplated her marriage chiefly as the beginning of new duties: from the very first she had thought of Mr. Casaubon as having a mind so much above her own, that he must often be claimed by studies which she could not entirely share; moreover, after the brief narrow experience of her girlhood she was beholding Rome, the city of visible history, where the past of a whole hemisphere seems moving in funeral procession with strange ancestral images and trophies gathered from afar.
Some discouragement, some faintness of heart at the new real future which replaces the imaginary, is not unusual, and we do not expect people to be deeply moved by what is not unusual.
If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence.
However, Dorothea was crying, and if she had been required to state the cause, she could only have done so in some such general words as I have already used: to have been driven to be more particular would have been like trying to give a history of the lights and shadows, for that new real future which was replacing the imaginary drew its material from the endless minutiae by which her view of Mr. Casaubon and her wifely relation, now that she was married to him, was gradually changing with the secret motion of a watch-hand from what it had been in her maiden dream.
Permanent rebellion, the disorder of a life without some loving reverent resolve, was not possible to her; but she was now in an interval when the very force of her nature heightened its confusion.
In this way, the early months of marriage often are times of critical tumult—whether that of a shrimp-pool or of deeper waters—which afterwards subsides into cheerful peace.
The fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are acquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few imaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of married companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than what you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether the same.
How was it that in the weeks since her marriage, Dorothea had not distinctly observed but felt with a stifling depression, that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she had dreamed of finding in her husband’s mind were replaced by anterooms and winding passages which seemed to lead nowhither?
I suppose it was that in courtship everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary, and the smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal.
But the door-sill of marriage once crossed, expectation is concentrated on the present.
In their conversation before marriage, Mr. Casaubon had often dwelt on some explanation or questionable detail of which Dorothea did not see the bearing; but such imperfect coherence seemed due to the brokenness of their intercourse, and, supported by her faith in their future, she had listened with fervid patience to a recitation of possible arguments to be brought against Mr. Casaubon’s entirely new view of the Philistine god Dagon and other fish-deities, thinking that hereafter she should see this subject which touched him so nearly from the same high ground whence doubtless it had become so important to him.
Some of them represent the fable of Cupid and Psyche, which is probably the romantic invention of a literary period, and cannot, I think, be reckoned as a genuine mythical product.
These characteristics, fixed and unchangeable as bone in Mr. Casaubon, might have remained longer unfelt by Dorothea if she had been encouraged to pour forth her girlish and womanly feeling—if he would have held her hands between his and listened with the delight of tenderness and understanding to all the little histories which made up her experience, and would have given her the same sort of intimacy in return, so that the past life of each could be included in their mutual knowledge and affection—or if she could have fed her affection with those childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman, who has begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald doll, creating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own love.
With all her yearning to know what was afar from her and to be widely benignant, she had ardor enough for what was near, to have kissed Mr. Casaubon’s coat-sleeve, or to have caressed his shoe-latchet, if he would have made any other sign of acceptance than pronouncing her, with his unfailing propriety, to be of a most affectionate and truly feminine nature, indicating at the same time by politely reaching a chair for her that he regarded these manifestations as rather crude and startling.
He had not found marriage a rapturous state, but he had no idea of being anything else than an irreproachable husband, who would make a charming young woman as happy as she deserved to be.
“The notes I have here made will want sifting, and you can, if you please, extract them under my direction.” “And all your notes,” said Dorothea, whose heart had already burned within her on this subject, so that now she could not help speaking with her tongue.
“My love,” he said, with irritation reined in by propriety, “you may rely upon me for knowing the times and the seasons, adapted to the different stages of a work which is not to be measured by the facile conjectures of ignorant onlookers.
But the idea of this dried-up pedant, this elaborator of small explanations about as important as the surplus stock of false antiquities kept in a vendor’s back chamber, having first got this adorable young creature to marry him, and then passing his honeymoon away from her, groping after his mouldy futilities (Will was given to hyperbole)—this sudden picture stirred him with a sort of comic disgust: he was divided between the impulse to laugh aloud and the equally unseasonable impulse to burst into scornful invective.
It would be a unique delight to wait and watch for the melodious fragments in which her heart and soul came forth so directly and ingenuously.
She must have made some original romance for herself in this marriage.
Would not love see returning penitence afar off, and fall on its neck and kiss it?
Putting it aside for a moment, he looked round vaguely, as if seeking some occupation for his visitors, and afterwards turning to Mr. Casaubon, said— “Perhaps the beautiful bride, the gracious lady, would not be unwilling to let me fill up the time by trying to make a slight sketch of her—not, of course, as you see, for that picture—only as a single study.” Mr. Casaubon, bowing, doubted not that Mrs. Casaubon would oblige him, and Dorothea said, at once, “Where shall I put myself?” Naumann was all apologies in asking her to stand, and allow him to adjust her attitude, to which she submitted without any of the affected airs and laughs frequently thought necessary on such occasions, when the painter said, “It is as Santa Clara that I want you to stand—leaning so, with your cheek against your hand—so—looking at that stool, please, so!” Will was divided between the inclination to fall at the Saint’s feet and kiss her robe, and the temptation to knock Naumann down while he was adjusting her arm.
I would rather never have seen you than think of you with such a prospect.” Will again feared that he had gone too far; but the meaning we attach to words depends on our feeling, and his tone of angry regret had so much kindness in it for Dorothea’s heart, which had always been giving out ardor and had never been fed with much from the living beings around her, that she felt a new sense of gratitude and answered with a gentle smile— “It is very good of you to be anxious about me.
It is because you did not like Lowick yourself: you had set your heart on another kind of life.
But Lowick is my chosen home.” The last sentence was spoken with an almost solemn cadence, and Will did not know what to say, since it would not be useful for him to embrace her slippers, and tell her that he would die for her: it was clear that she required nothing of the sort; and they were both silent for a moment or two, when Dorothea began again with an air of saying at last what had been in her mind beforehand.
“But Mr. Casaubon, I am sure, has never thought of anything in the matter except what was most for your welfare.” “She has obstinacy and pride enough to serve instead of love, now she has married him,” said Will to himself.
“What is that, my love?” said Mr Casaubon (he always said “my love” when his manner was the coldest).
“I had a duty towards him,” said Mr. Casaubon, laying his other hand on Dorothea’s in conscientious acceptance of her caress, but with a glance which he could not hinder from being uneasy.
The Garths were very fond of Fred, as he was of them; for when he and Rosamond were little ones, and the Garths were better off, the slight connection between the two families through Mr. Featherstone’s double marriage (the first to Mr. Garth’s sister, and the second to Mrs. Vincy’s) had led to an acquaintance which was carried on between the children rather than the parents: the children drank tea together out of their toy teacups, and spent whole days together in play.
Through all the stages of his education he had kept his affection for the Garths, and his habit of going to their house as a second home, though any intercourse between them and the elders of his family had long ceased.
Mrs. Vincy had never been at her ease with Mrs. Garth, and frequently spoke of her as a woman who had had to work for her bread—meaning that Mrs. Garth had been a teacher before her marriage; in which case an intimacy with Lindley Murray and Mangnall’s Questions was something like a draper’s discrimination of calico trademarks, or a courier’s acquaintance with foreign countries: no woman who was better off needed that sort of thing.
And since Mary had been keeping Mr. Featherstone’s house, Mrs. Vincy’s want of liking for the Garths had been converted into something more positive, by alarm lest Fred should engage himself to this plain girl, whose parents “lived in such a small way.” Fred, being aware of this, never spoke at home of his visits to Mrs. Garth, which had of late become more frequent, the increasing ardor of his affection for Mary inclining him the more towards those who belonged to her.
He obtained it without much difficulty, for a large amount of painful experience had not sufficed to make Caleb Garth cautious about his own affairs, or distrustful of his fellow-men when they had not proved themselves untrustworthy; and he had the highest opinion of Fred, was “sure the lad would turn out well—an open affectionate fellow, with a good bottom to his character—you might trust him for anything.” Such was Caleb’s psychological argument.
Accordingly, he took the paper and lowered his spectacles, measured the space at his command, reached his pen and examined it, dipped it in the ink and examined it again, then pushed the paper a little way from him, lifted up his spectacles again, showed a deepened depression in the outer angle of his bushy eyebrows, which gave his face a peculiar mildness (pardon these details for once—you would have learned to love them if you had known Caleb Garth), and said in a comfortable tone,— “It was a misfortune, eh, that breaking the horse’s knees?
He made the resolution with a sense of heroism—heroism forced on him by the dread of breaking his word to Mr. Garth, by his love for Mary and awe of her opinion.
Considering that Fred was not at all coarse, that he rather looked down on the manners and speech of young men who had not been to the university, and that he had written stanzas as pastoral and unvoluptuous as his flute-playing, his attraction towards Bambridge and Horrock was an interesting fact which even the love of horse-flesh would not wholly account for without that mysterious influence of Naming which determinates so much of mortal choice.
For himself he only wanted a useful hack, which would draw upon occasion; being about to marry and to give up hunting.
In fact, it is probable that but for Mary’s existence and Fred’s love for her, his conscience would have been much less active both in previously urging the debt on his thought and impelling him not to spare himself after his usual fashion by deferring an unpleasant task, but to act as directly and simply as he could.
Even much stronger mortals than Fred Vincy hold half their rectitude in the mind of the being they love best.
Fred liked it too, knowing it by heart even to the attic which smelt deliciously of apples and quinces, and until to-day he had never come to it without pleasant expectations; but his heart beat uneasily now with the sense that he should probably have to make his confession before Mrs. Garth, of whom he was rather more in awe than of her husband.
But he could not manage finance: he knew values well, but he had no keenness of imagination for monetary results in the shape of profit and loss: and having ascertained this to his cost, he determined to give up all forms of his beloved “business” which required that talent.
There is often something maternal even in a girlish love, and Mary’s hard experience had wrought her nature to an impressibility very different from that hard slight thing which we call girlishness.
And with so much good in your disposition, Fred,—you might be worth a great deal.” “I will try to be anything you like, Mary, if you will say that you love me.” “I should be ashamed to say that I loved a man who must always be hanging on others, and reckoning on what they would do for him.
After discussing prices during tea with Mr. Featherstone, Caleb rose to bid him good-by, and said, “I want to speak to you, Mary.” She took a candle into another large parlor, where there was no fire, and setting down the feeble light on the dark mahogany table, turned round to her father, and putting her arms round his neck kissed him with childish kisses which he delighted in,—the expression of his large brows softening as the expression of a great beautiful dog softens when it is caressed.
Mary was his favorite child, and whatever Susan might say, and right as she was on all other subjects, Caleb thought it natural that Fred or any one else should think Mary more lovable than other girls.
However, you have more sense than most, and you haven’t been kept in cotton-wool: there may be no occasion for me to say this, but a father trembles for his daughter, and you are all by yourself here.” “Don’t fear for me, father,” said Mary, gravely meeting her father’s eyes; “Fred has always been very good to me; he is kind-hearted and affectionate, and not false, I think, with all his self-indulgence.
“Take pocketfuls of love besides to them all at home,” was her last word before he closed the outer door on himself.
Let the high Muse chant loves Olympian: We are but mortals, and must sing of man.
Fred’s delirium, in which he seemed to be wandering out of her reach, tore her heart.
All the deepest fibres of the mother’s memory were stirred, and the young man whose voice took a gentler tone when he spoke to her, was one with the babe whom she had loved, with a love new to her, before he was born.
No word passed his lips; but “to hear with eyes belongs to love’s rare wit,” and the mother in the fulness of her heart not only divined Fred’s longing, but felt ready for any sacrifice in order to satisfy him.
“If I can only see my boy strong again,” she said, in her loving folly; “and who knows?—perhaps master of Stone Court!
and he can marry anybody he likes then.” “Not if they won’t have me, mother,” said Fred.
There was no help for this in science, and as Lydgate did not want to flirt, there seemed to be no help for it in folly.
The preposterousness of the notion that he could at once set up a satisfactory establishment as a married man was a sufficient guarantee against danger.
This play at being a little in love was agreeable, and did not interfere with graver pursuits.
Rosamond, for her part, had never enjoyed the days so much in her life before: she was sure of being admired by some one worth captivating, and she did not distinguish flirtation from love, either in herself or in another.
She was quite determined, when she was married, to rid herself adroitly of all the visitors who were not agreeable to her at her father’s; and she imagined the drawing-room in her favorite house with various styles of furniture.
If Lydgate had been aware of all the pride he excited in that delicate bosom, he might have been just as well pleased as any other man, even the most densely ignorant of humoral pathology or fibrous tissue: he held it one of the prettiest attitudes of the feminine mind to adore a man’s pre-eminence without too precise a knowledge of what it consisted in.
In fact, they flirted; and Lydgate was secure in the belief that they did nothing else.
If a man could not love and be wise, surely he could flirt and be wise at the same time?
“You will see Fred so changed,” she added, turning to the other suitor; “we have looked to Mr. Lydgate as our guardian angel during this illness.” Mr. Ned smiled nervously, while Lydgate, drawing the “Keepsake” towards him and opening it, gave a short scornful laugh and tossed up his chin, as if in wonderment at human folly.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The calendar hath not an evil day For souls made one by love, and even death Were sweetness, if it came like rolling waves While they two clasped each other, and foresaw No life apart.
The duties of her married life, contemplated as so great beforehand, seemed to be shrinking with the furniture and the white vapor-walled landscape.
In this solemnly pledged union of her life, duty would present itself in some new form of inspiration and give a new meaning to wifely love.
Was it only her friends who thought her marriage unfortunate?
Here was a woman who had known some difficulty about marriage.
“Dodo!” said Celia, in her quiet staccato; then kissed her sister, whose arms encircled her, and said no more.
“I need not ask how you are, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, after kissing her forehead.
Cadwallader says it is nonsense, people going a long journey when they are married.
And Lady Chettam says she went to Bath.” Celia’s color changed again and again—seemed “To come and go with tidings from the heart, As it a running messenger had been.” It must mean more than Celia’s blushing usually did.
Celia’s marriage seemed more serious than it used to do.
We are not going to be married yet.
And I don’t want to be married so very soon, because I think it is nice to be engaged.
And we shall be married all our lives after.” “I do believe you could not marry better, Kitty.
Was her point of view the only possible one with regard to this marriage?
Times had altered since then, and no sonneteer had insisted on Mr. Casaubon’s leaving a copy of himself; moreover, he had not yet succeeded in issuing copies of his mythological key; but he had always intended to acquit himself by marriage, and the sense that he was fast leaving the years behind him, that the world was getting dimmer and that he felt lonely, was a reason to him for losing no more time in overtaking domestic delights before they too were left behind by the years.
To this mental estate mapped out a quarter of a century before, to sensibilities thus fenced in, Mr. Casaubon had thought of annexing happiness with a lovely young bride; but even before marriage, as we have seen, he found himself under a new depression in the consciousness that the new bliss was not blissful to him.
Even drawing Dorothea into use in his study, according to his own intention before marriage, was an effort which he was always tempted to defer, and but for her pleading insistence it might never have begun.
Celia at this time was on a second visit to Lowick, probably the last before her marriage, and was in the drawing-room expecting Sir James.
There are answers which, in turning away wrath, only send it to the other end of the room, and to have a discussion coolly waived when you feel that justice is all on your own side is even more exasperating in marriage than in philosophy.
If Cadwallader—if every one else had regarded the affair as he, Sir James, had done, the marriage might have been hindered.
Sir James had long ceased to have any regrets on his own account: his heart was satisfied with his engagement to Celia.
): his disregarded love had not turned to bitterness; its death had made sweet odors—floating memories that clung with a consecrating effect to Dorothea.
Or get Dorothea to read you light things, Smollett—‘Roderick Random,’ ‘Humphrey Clinker:’ they are a little broad, but she may read anything now she’s married, you know.
With a happy concurrence of circumstances, there is, as I said, no immediate danger from that affection of the heart, which I believe to have been the cause of his late attack.
“Nothing will be of any use that he does not enjoy.” “I wish that I could have spared you this pain,” said Lydgate, deeply touched, yet wondering about her marriage.
Since Celia was going to marry immediately, it would be very pleasant to have a young fellow at table with him, at least for a time.
It was not more possible to find social isolation in that town than elsewhere, and two people persistently flirting could by no means escape from “the various entanglements, weights, blows, clashings, motions, by which things severally go on.” Whatever Miss Vincy did must be remarked, and she was perhaps the more conspicuous to admirers and critics because just now Mrs. Vincy, after some struggle, had gone with Fred to stay a little while at Stone Court, there being no other way of at once gratifying old Featherstone and keeping watch against Mary Garth, who appeared a less tolerable daughter-in-law in proportion as Fred’s illness disappeared.
For Mrs. Bulstrode had a true sisterly feeling for her brother; always thinking that he might have married better, but wishing well to the children.
I spoke as a mother.” “Selina, I am sure you have never heard me say anything against a niece of mine marrying your son.” “Oh, it is pride in Miss Vincy—I am sure it is nothing else,” said Mrs. Plymdale, who had never before given all her confidence to “Harriet” on this subject.
Mr. Lydgate is very intellectual and clever; I know there is an attraction in that.
And you are not fit to marry a poor man.
I would rather not speak on the subject.” “You would not give your heart to a man without a decided prospect, I trust, my dear.
I knew a very great beauty who married badly at last, by doing so.
Not that marrying is everything.
But a girl should keep her heart within her own power.” “I should never give it to Mr. Ned Plymdale, if it were.
If I loved, I should love at once and without change,” said Rosamond, with a great sense of being a romantic heroine, and playing the part prettily.
Mr. Bulstrode in things worldly and indifferent was disposed to do what his wife bade him, and she now, without telling her reasons, desired him on the next opportunity to find out in conversation with Mr. Lydgate whether he had any intention of marrying soon.
“On the other hand, a man must be a great coxcomb to go about with a notion that he must not pay attention to a young lady lest she should fall in love with him, or lest others should think she must.” “Oh, Mr. Lydgate, you know well what your advantages are.
She felt that she was beginning to know the pang of disappointed love, and that no other man could be the occasion of such delightful aerial building as she had been enjoying for the last six months.
There are many wonderful mixtures in the world which are all alike called love, and claim the privileges of a sublime rage which is an apology for everything (in literature and the drama).
That moment of naturalness was the crystallizing feather-touch: it shook flirtation into love.
He did not know where the chain went; an idea had thrilled through the recesses within him which had a miraculous effect in raising the power of passionate love lying buried there in no sealed sepulchre, but under the lightest, easily pierced mould.
There could have been no more complete answer than that silence, and Lydgate, forgetting everything else, completely mastered by the outrush of tenderness at the sudden belief that this sweet young creature depended on him for her joy, actually put his arms round her, folding her gently and protectingly—he was used to being gentle with the weak and suffering—and kissed each of the two large tears.
A man whose life is of any value should think of his wife as a nurse: that is what I should do, if I married; and I believe I have lived single long enough not to make a mistake in that line.
Some men must marry to elevate themselves a little, but when I am in need of that, I hope some one will tell me so—I hope some individual will apprise me of the fact.
Mary might have become cynical if she had not had parents whom she honored, and a well of affectionate gratitude within her, which was all the fuller because she had learned to make no unreasonable claims.
Call Fred Vincy.” Mary’s heart began to beat more quickly.
The violent beating of her heart rendered her perceptions so doubtful that even when she touched him and listened for his breathing, she could not trust her conclusions.
He loved money, but he also loved to spend it in gratifying his peculiar tastes, and perhaps he loved it best of all as a means of making others feel his power more or less uncomfortably.
When I married Humphrey I made up my mind to like sermons, and I set out by liking the end very much.
I cannot bear to think that any one should die and leave no love behind.” She was going to say more, but she saw her husband enter and seat himself a little in the background.
The long-recognized blood-relations and connections by marriage made already a goodly number, which, multiplied by possibilities, presented a fine range for jealous conjecture and pathetic hopefulness.
“I never _was_ covetous, Jane,” she replied; “but I have six children and have buried three, and I didn’t marry into money.
“Good-by,” she said, with affectionate sadness.
’T is strange to see the humors of these men, These great aspiring spirits, that should be wise: . . . . . . . . For being the nature of great spirits to love To be where they may be most eminent; They, rating of themselves so farre above Us in conceit, with whom they do frequent, Imagine how we wonder and esteeme All that they do or say; which makes them strive To make our admiration more extreme, Which they suppose they cannot, ’less they give Notice of their extreme and highest thoughts.
Twenty-four hours ago he had thought that instead of needing to know what he should do, he should by this time know that he needed to do nothing: that he should hunt in pink, have a first-rate hunter, ride to cover on a fine hack, and be generally respected for doing so; moreover, that he should be able at once to pay Mr. Garth, and that Mary could no longer have any reason for not marrying him.
Lydgate has kept the highest company and been everywhere, and he fell in love with her at once.
I shan’t give my consent to their marrying.
The marriage would please _him_, I should think.” “Please the deuce!” said Mr. Vincy.
“What do you say, my dear?” said her mother, with affectionate deference.
“He has always said that he wished me to marry the man I loved.
And I shall marry Mr. Lydgate.
Mrs. Bretton’s is very large, though: I should love you to have such a house; but it will take a great deal of furniture—carpeting and everything, besides plate and glass.
Of course he understands his own affairs.” “But he may have been looking for money, my dear, and we all thought of your having a pretty legacy as well as Fred;—and now everything is so dreadful—there’s no pleasure in thinking of anything, with that poor boy disappointed as he is.” “That has nothing to do with my marriage, mamma.
Papa was not a rock: he had no other fixity than that fixity of alternating impulses sometimes called habit, and this was altogether unfavorable to his taking the only decisive line of conduct in relation to his daughter’s engagement—namely, to inquire thoroughly into Lydgate’s circumstances, declare his own inability to furnish money, and forbid alike either a speedy marriage or an engagement which must be too lengthy.
Mr. Vincy was a little in awe of him, a little vain that he wanted to marry Rosamond, a little indisposed to raise a question of money in which his own position was not advantageous, a little afraid of being worsted in dialogue with a man better educated and more highly bred than himself, and a little afraid of doing what his daughter would not like.
The accepted lover spent most of his evenings in Lowick Gate, and a love-making not at all dependent on money-advances from fathers-in-law, or prospective income from a profession, went on flourishingly under Mr. Vincy’s own eyes.
And Lydgate fell to spinning that web from his inward self with wonderful rapidity, in spite of experience supposed to be finished off with the drama of Laure—in spite too of medicine and biology; for the inspection of macerated muscle or of eyes presented in a dish (like Santa Lucia’s), and other incidents of scientific inquiry, are observed to be less incompatible with poetic love than a native dulness or a lively addiction to the lowest prose.
I was a good brother to you, Harriet, before you married Bulstrode, and I must say he doesn’t always show that friendly spirit towards your family that might have been expected of him.” Mr. Vincy was very little like a Jesuit, but no accomplished Jesuit could have turned a question more adroitly.
Of course he must be married in a year—perhaps even in half a year.
Certainly, being in love and being expected continually by some one who always turned out to be prettier than memory could represent her to be, did interfere with the diligent use of spare hours which might serve some “plodding fellow of a German” to make the great, imminent discovery.
This was really an argument for not deferring the marriage too long, as he implied to Mr. Farebrother, one day that the Vicar came to his room with some pond-products which he wanted to examine under a better microscope than his own, and, finding Lydgate’s tableful of apparatus and specimens in confusion, said sarcastically— “Eros has degenerated; he began by introducing order and harmony, and now he brings back chaos.” “Yes, at some stages,” said Lydgate, lifting his brows and smiling, while he began to arrange his microscope.
I feel sure that marriage must be the best thing for a man who wants to work steadily.
Now, are you ready?” Lydgate did not mention to the Vicar another reason he had for wishing to shorten the period of courtship.
It was rather irritating to him, even with the wine of love in his veins, to be obliged to mingle so often with the family party at the Vincys’, and to enter so much into Middlemarch gossip, protracted good cheer, whist-playing, and general futility.
But that exquisite creature herself suffered in the same sort of way:—it was at least one delightful thought that in marrying her, he could give her a much-needed transplantation.
He kissed the hesitating lips gently, as if to encourage them.
“God bless you!” said Lydgate, kissing her again.
“This is the first time I ever heard of wedding-clothes being bought after marriage.” “But you don’t mean to say you would insist on my waiting months for the sake of clothes?” said Lydgate, half thinking that Rosamond was tormenting him prettily, and half fearing that she really shrank from speedy marriage.
She looked at her lover with some wondering remonstrance as she spoke, and he readily understood that she might wish to lengthen the sweet time of double solitude.
He touched her ear and a little bit of neck under it with his lips, and they sat quite still for many minutes which flowed by them like a small gurgling brook with the kisses of the sun upon it.
Rosamond thought that no one could be more in love than she was; and Lydgate thought that after all his wild mistakes and absurd credulity, he had found perfect womanhood—felt as if already breathed upon by exquisite wedded affection such as would be bestowed by an accomplished creature who venerated his high musings and momentous labors and would never interfere with them; who would create order in the home and accounts with still magic, yet keep her fingers ready to touch the lute and transform life into romance at any moment; who was instructed to the true womanly limit and not a hair’s-breadth beyond—docile, therefore, and ready to carry out behests which came from that limit.
It was plainer now than ever that his notion of remaining much longer a bachelor had been a mistake: marriage would not be an obstruction but a furtherance.
Of course it was unnecessary to defer the mention of anything to mamma, who did not readily take views that were not cheerful, and being a happy wife herself, had hardly any feeling but pride in her daughter’s marriage.
She prepared for the arrival of the letter by walking with her papa to the warehouse the next morning, and telling him on the way that Mr. Lydgate wished to be married soon.
“What has he got to marry on?
What have you had such an education for, if you are to go and marry a poor man?
what can that have to do with my marriage?” “A pretty deal to do with it!
I could never love any one who was not a perfect gentleman.
However, it seemed to make everything comfortable about Rosamond’s marriage; and the necessary purchases went on with much spirit.
Does he know you are going to be married?” “No,” said Lydgate, carelessly, turning in his chair and rubbing his hair up.
Thrice happy she that is so well assured Unto herself and settled so in heart That neither will for better be allured Ne fears to worse with any chance to start, But like a steddy ship doth strongly part The raging waves and keeps her course aright; Ne aught for tempest doth from it depart, Ne aught for fairer weather’s false delight.
Most happy she that most assured doth rest, But he most happy who such one loves best.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>He was much obliged to Casaubon in the past, but really the act of marrying this wife was a set-off against the obligation.
And Casaubon had done a wrong to Dorothea in marrying her.
Poor Dorothea before her marriage had never found much room in other minds for what she cared most to say; and she had not, as we know, enjoyed her husband’s superior instruction so much as she had expected.
“It seems strange to me how many things I said to you.” “I remember them all,” said Will, with the unspeakable content in his soul of feeling that he was in the presence of a creature worthy to be perfectly loved.
I think his own feelings at that moment were perfect, for we mortals have our divine moments, when love is satisfied in the completeness of the beloved object.
But she had never before said anything to Will which threw so strong a light on her marriage.
He did not shrug his shoulders; and for want of that muscular outlet he thought the more irritably of beautiful lips kissing holy skulls and other emptinesses ecclesiastically enshrined.
Will was ready to adore her pity and loyalty, if she would associate himself with her in manifesting them.
All the energy of Dorothea’s nature went on the side of responsibility—the fulfilment of claims founded on our own deeds, such as marriage and parentage.
And now she began to think of her husband’s will, which had been made at the time of their marriage, leaving the bulk of his property to her, with proviso in case of her having children.
Everything seemed hindrance to her till she could find an opportunity of opening her heart to her husband.
“Certainly.” “I have been thinking about money all day—that I have always had too much, and especially the prospect of too much.” “These, my dear Dorothea, are providential arrangements.” “But if one has too much in consequence of others being wronged, it seems to me that the divine voice which tells us to set that wrong right must be obeyed.” “What, my love, is the bearing of your remark?” “That you have been too liberal in arrangements for me—I mean, with regard to property; and that makes me unhappy.” “How so?
I have none but comparatively distant connections.” “I have been led to think about your aunt Julia, and how she was left in poverty only because she married a poor man, an act which was not disgraceful, since he was not unworthy.
“Dorothea, my love, this is not the first occasion, but it were well that it should be the last, on which you have assumed a judgment on subjects beyond your scope.
To let any one suppose that he was jealous would be to admit their (suspected) view of his disadvantages: to let them know that he did not find marriage particularly blissful would imply his conversion to their (probably) earlier disapproval.
And now he has done it.” “Well, he might have taken it into his head to marry,” said the Rector.
“That would have been a graver mess than a little flirtation with politics.” “He may do that afterwards,” said Mrs. Cadwallader—“when he has come out on the other side of the mud with an ague.” “What I care for most is his own dignity,” said Sir James.
A sort of Byronic hero—an amorous conspirator, it strikes me.
“If, as I have, you also doe, Vertue attired in woman see, And dare love that, and say so too, And forget the He and She; And if this love, though placed so, From prophane men you hide, Which will no faith on this bestow, Or, if they doe, deride: Then you have done a braver thing Than all the Worthies did, And a braver thence will spring, Which is, to keep that hid.” —DR.
“Well, my dear, this is pleasant, now,” said Mr. Brooke, meeting and kissing her.
Oh, how happy!”—she went on, clasping her hands, with a return to that more childlike impetuous manner, which had been subdued since her marriage.
I think we have no right to come forward and urge wider changes for good, until we have tried to alter the evils which lie under our own hands.” Dorothea had gathered emotion as she went on, and had forgotten everything except the relief of pouring forth her feelings, unchecked: an experience once habitual with her, but hardly ever present since her marriage, which had been a perpetual struggle of energy with fear.
A man is seldom ashamed of feeling that he cannot love a woman so well when he sees a certain greatness in her: nature having intended greatness for men.
She was thinking of what Will had no knowledge of—the conversation between her and her husband in the darkness; and she was anew smitten with hopelessness that she could influence Mr. Casaubon’s action.
“I mean—not what you know about religion, but the belief that helps you most?” “To love what is good and beautiful when I see it,” said Will.
It is for Rosamond Vincy: she is to be married next week, and she can’t be married without this handkerchief.” Mary ended merrily, amused with the last notion.
But she’s an old brick,” said Alfred, rising from his chair, and pulling Mary’s head backward to kiss her.
The fact is, poor fellow,” he continued, as he seated himself and looked round with his bright glance at the three who were listening to him, “he has taken me into his confidence.” Mary’s heart beat rather quickly: she wondered how far Fred’s confidence had gone.
But she was made exultant by having her chin pinched and her cheek kissed by Mr. Farebrother—an incident which she narrated to her mother and father.
Then he laughed at himself for being likely to have felt jealous, as if he had been a man able to marry, which, added he, it is as clear as any balance-sheet that I am not.
A human being in this aged nation of ours is a very wonderful whole, the slow creation of long interchanging influences: and charm is a result of two such wholes, the one loving and the one loved.
I will add that his finger-nails were scrupulously attended to, and that he meant to marry a well-educated young lady (as yet unspecified) whose person was good, and whose connections, in a solid middle-class way, were undeniable.
His discontent passed vapor-like through all her gentle loving manifestations, and clung to that inappreciative world which she had only brought nearer to him.
And who, if Mr. Casaubon had chosen to expound his discontents—his suspicions that he was not any longer adored without criticism—could have denied that they were founded on good reasons?
The way in which Mr. Casaubon put the case was this:—“In marrying Dorothea Brooke I had to care for her well-being in case of my death.
She is ready prey to any man who knows how to play adroitly either on her affectionate ardor or her Quixotic enthusiasm; and a man stands by with that very intention in his mind—a man with no other principle than transient caprice, and who has a personal animosity towards me—I am sure of it—an animosity which is fed by the consciousness of his ingratitude, and which he has constantly vented in ridicule of which I am as well assured as if I had heard it.
If I die—and he is waiting here on the watch for that—he will persuade her to marry him.
Such a marriage would be fatal to Dorothea.
I utterly distrust his morals, and it is my duty to hinder to the utmost the fulfilment of his designs.” The arrangements made by Mr. Casaubon on his marriage left strong measures open to him, but in ruminating on them his mind inevitably dwelt so much on the probabilities of his own life that the longing to get the nearest possible calculation had at last overcome his proud reticence, and had determined him to ask Lydgate’s opinion as to the nature of his illness.
If not, knowledge of the truth is even more important to me.” “Then I can no longer hesitate as to my course,” said Lydgate; “but the first thing I must impress on you is that my conclusions are doubly uncertain—uncertain not only because of my fallibility, but because diseases of the heart are eminently difficult to found predictions on.
“I believe that you are suffering from what is called fatty degeneration of the heart, a disease which was first divined and explored by Laennec, the man who gave us the stethoscope, not so very many years ago.
But what we strive to gratify, though we may call it a distant hope, is an immediate desire: the future estate for which men drudge up city alleys exists already in their imagination and love.
Then she went towards him, and might have represented a heaven-sent angel coming with a promise that the short hours remaining should yet be filled with that faithful love which clings the closer to a comprehended grief.
She was in the reaction of a rebellious anger stronger than any she had felt since her marriage.
He wishes he had never married me.” She began to hear herself, and was checked into stillness.
That thought with which Dorothea had gone out to meet her husband—her conviction that he had been asking about the possible arrest of all his work, and that the answer must have wrung his heart, could not be long without rising beside the image of him, like a shadowy monitor looking at her anger with sad remonstrance.
“This figure hath high price: ’t was wrought with love Ages ago in finest ivory; Nought modish in it, pure and noble lines Of generous womanhood that fits all time That too is costly ware; majolica Of deft design, to please a lordly eye: The smile, you see, is perfect—wonderful As mere Faience!
“Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?” said Dorothea, who had never, that she knew of, seen Rosamond, but now remembered the fact of the marriage.
Do you like him?” “Yes: I think he is a good fellow: rather miscellaneous and bric-a-brac, but likable.” “Do you know, I think he adores Mrs. Casaubon.” “Poor devil!” said Lydgate, smiling and pinching his wife’s ears.
Rosamond felt herself beginning to know a great deal of the world, especially in discovering what when she was in her unmarried girlhood had been inconceivable to her except as a dim tragedy in by-gone costumes—that women, even after marriage, might make conquests and enslave men.
How delightful to make captives from the throne of marriage with a husband as crown-prince by your side—himself in fact a subject—while the captives look up forever hopeless, losing their rest probably, and if their appetite too, so much the better!
But Rosamond’s romance turned at present chiefly on her crown-prince, and it was enough to enjoy his assured subjection.
When he said, “Poor devil!” she asked, with playful curiosity— “Why so?” “Why, what can a man do when he takes to adoring one of you mermaids?
Confess you like those things better than me.” “Haven’t you ambition enough to wish that your husband should be something better than a Middlemarch doctor?” said Lydgate, letting his hands fall on to his wife’s shoulders, and looking at her with affectionate gravity.
I think you are generally interested in such things, for I remember that when I first had the pleasure of seeing you at Tipton Grange before your marriage, you were asking me some questions about the way in which the health of the poor was affected by their miserable housing.” “Yes, indeed,” said Dorothea, brightening.
Everything of that sort has slipped away from me since I have been married.
I must hasten home now.” She did mention it that evening, and said that she should like to subscribe two hundred a-year—she had seven hundred a-year as the equivalent of her own fortune, settled on her at her marriage.
If he ever felt keenly any question of money it was through the medium of another passion than the love of material property.
He distrusted her affection; and what loneliness is more lonely than distrust?
Think of what I have to provide for calling customers, my dear!”—here Mrs. Mawmsey turned to an intimate female friend who sat by—“a large veal pie—a stuffed fillet—a round of beef—ham, tongue, et cetera, et cetera!

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“That is like saying you wish you had married another man.” “Not at all; you are clever enough for anything: you might easily have been something else.
“And to say that you love me without loving the medical man in me, is the same sort of thing as to say that you like eating a peach but don’t like its flavor.
While Lydgate, safely married and with the Hospital under his command, felt himself struggling for Medical Reform against Middlemarch, Middlemarch was becoming more and more conscious of the national struggle for another kind of Reform.
I don’t care for prestige or high pay.” As Lydgate had said of him, he was a sort of gypsy, rather enjoying the sense of belonging to no class; he had a feeling of romance in his position, and a pleasant consciousness of creating a little surprise wherever he went.
He had a fondness, half artistic, half affectionate, for little children—the smaller they were on tolerably active legs, and the funnier their clothing, the better Will liked to surprise and please them.
In fact, I should rather attribute to you a romantic disregard of your own worldly interests.
Was never true love loved in vain, For truest love is highest gain.
The words were not exactly a hymn, but they certainly fitted his Sunday experience:— “O me, O me, what frugal cheer My love doth feed upon!
A touch, a ray, that is not here, A shadow that is gone: “A dream of breath that might be near, An inly-echoed tone, The thought that one may think me dear, The place where one was known, “The tremor of a banished fear, An ill that was not done— O me, O me, what frugal cheer My love doth feed upon!” Sometimes, when he took off his hat, shaking his head backward, and showing his delicate throat as he sang, he looked like an incarnation of the spring whose spirit filled the air—a bright creature, abundant in uncertain promises.
It was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor Dorothea was hungering for, and the hunger had grown from the perpetual effort demanded by her married life.
She felt sick at heart.
Whatever affection prompted I would do without promising.” “But you would use your own judgment: I ask you to obey mine; you refuse.” “No, dear, no!” said Dorothea, beseechingly, crushed by opposing fears.
And had she not wished to marry him that she might help him in his life’s labor?—But she had thought the work was to be something greater, which she could serve in devoutly for its own sake.
No; his heart was bound up in his work only: that was the end for which his failing life was to be eked out by hers.
if you die, I will put no finger to your work”—it seemed as if she would be crushing that bruised heart.
“God bless you, madam!” said Tantripp, with an irrepressible movement of love towards the beautiful, gentle creature for whom she felt unable to do anything more, now that she had finished tying the bonnet.
Neither law nor the world’s opinion compelled her to this—only her husband’s nature and her own compassion, only the ideal and not the real yoke of marriage.
I say that there never was a meaner, more ungentlemanly action than this—a codicil of this sort to a will which he made at the time of his marriage with the knowledge and reliance of her family—a positive insult to Dorothea!” “Well, you know, Casaubon was a little twisted about Ladislaw.
“I am sure Casaubon was not.” “Well, it would have been worse if he had made the codicil to hinder her from marrying again at all, you know.” “I don’t know that,” said Sir James.
She doesn’t _want_ to marry Ladislaw.” “But this codicil is framed so as to make everybody believe that she did.
But Mr. Brooke had been right in predicting that Dorothea would not long remain passive where action had been assigned to her; she knew the purport of her husband’s will made at the time of their marriage, and her mind, as soon as she was clearly conscious of her position, was silently occupied with what she ought to do as the owner of Lowick Manor with the patronage of the living attached to it.
“Don’t be sad, Dodo; kiss baby.
“But if you married Mr. Ladislaw, not anybody else,” Celia went on with persevering quietude.
“Of course that is of no consequence in one way—you never _would_ marry Mr. Ladislaw; but that only makes it worse of Mr. Casaubon.” The blood rushed to Dorothea’s face and neck painfully.
It is as if Mr. Casaubon wanted to make people believe that you would wish to marry Mr. Ladislaw—which is ridiculous.
Only James says it was to hinder Mr. Ladislaw from wanting to marry you for your money—just as if he ever would think of making you an offer.
Mrs. Cadwallader said you might as well marry an Italian with white mice!
Then again she was conscious of another change which also made her tremulous; it was a sudden strange yearning of heart towards Will Ladislaw.
It had never before entered her mind that he could, under any circumstances, be her lover: conceive the effect of the sudden revelation that another had thought of him in that light—that perhaps he himself had been conscious of such a possibility,—and this with the hurrying, crowding vision of unfitting conditions, and questions not soon to be solved.
Mr. Casaubon had taken a cruelly effective means of hindering her: even with indignation against him in her heart, any act that seemed a triumphant eluding of his purpose revolted her.
After collecting papers of business which she wished to examine, she locked up again the desks and drawers—all empty of personal words for her—empty of any sign that in her husband’s lonely brooding his heart had gone out to her in excuse or explanation; and she went back to Freshitt with the sense that around his last hard demand and his last injurious assertion of his power, the silence was unbroken.
I believe he has never married because of them.
He is very much beloved, but he has his enemies too: there are always people who can’t forgive an able man for differing from them.
I met them one day in a back street: you know Ladislaw’s look—a sort of Daphnis in coat and waistcoat; and this little old maid reaching up to his arm—they looked like a couple dropped out of a romantic comedy.
As was usual with him in matters of personal gossip, Lydgate had quite forgotten Rosamond’s remark that she thought Will adored Mrs. Casaubon.
Mr. Brooke, conscious of having weakened the blasts of the “Trumpet” against him, by his reforms as a landlord in the last half year, and hearing himself cheered a little as he drove into the town, felt his heart tolerably light under his buff-colored waistcoat.
Five years:—if he could only be sure that she cared for him more than for others; if he could only make her aware that he stood aloof until he could tell his love without lowering himself—then he could go away easily, and begin a career which at five-and-twenty seemed probable enough in the inward order of things, where talent brings fame, and fame everything else which is delightful.
He could not be satisfied until she knew why, even if he were the man she would choose to marry, he would not marry her.
“His heart The lowliest duties on itself did lay.” —WORDSWORTH.
“As for you, Winny”—the Vicar went on—“I shall make no difficulty about your marrying any Lowick bachelor—Mr.
Solomon Featherstone, for example, as soon as I find you are in love with him.” Miss Winifred, who had been looking at her brother all the while and crying heartily, which was her way of rejoicing, smiled through her tears and said, “You must set me the example, Cam: _you_ must marry now.” “With all my heart.
But who is in love with me?
“I wish you would marry Miss Garth, brother,” said Miss Winifred.
He made no display of humility on the subject, but in his heart he felt rather ashamed that his conduct had shown laches which others who did not get benefices were free from.
There is somebody I am very fond of: I have loved her ever since we were children.” “Miss Garth, I suppose?” said the Vicar, examining some labels very closely.
Men outlive their love, but they don’t outlive the consequences of their recklessness.” “Not my sort of love: I have never been without loving Mary.
“But not with young gentlemen?” “Oh, with some, I suppose; since some of them turn into excellent men.” “I am glad of that admission, because I want at this very moment to interest you in a young gentleman.” “Not a silly one, I hope,” said Mary, beginning to pluck the roses again, and feeling her heart beat uncomfortably.
“No; though perhaps wisdom is not his strong point, but rather affection and sincerity.
He meant to give Fred his full advantage, but it would be well, he thought, to clear her mind of any superstitions, such as women sometimes follow when they do a man the wrong of marrying him as an act of atonement.
He has opened his heart to me, Miss Garth, and asked me to plead for him.
“I could not love a man who is ridiculous,” said Mary, not choosing to go deeper.
She had never thought that any man could love her except Fred, who had espoused her with the umbrella ring, when she wore socks and little strapped shoes; still less that she could be of any importance to Mr. Farebrother, the cleverest man in her narrow circle.
It has taken such deep root in me—my gratitude to him for always loving me best, and minding so much if I hurt myself, from the time when we were very little.
But please tell him I will not promise to marry him till then: I should shame and grieve my father and mother.
From his earliest employment as an errand-boy in a seaport, he had looked through the windows of the moneychangers as other boys look through the windows of the pastry-cooks; the fascination had wrought itself gradually into a deep special passion; he meant, when he had property, to do many things, one of them being to marry a genteel young person; but these were all accidents and joys that imagination could dispense with.
His brief reverie was interrupted by the return of Caleb Garth, who also was on horseback, and was just shaking his bridle before starting, when he exclaimed— “Bless my heart!
It’s uncommonly fortunate I met you, though; for I don’t care about seeing my stepson: he’s not affectionate, and his poor mother’s gone now.
To tell the truth, I came out of love to you, Nick: I came to get your address, for—look here!” Raffles drew a crumpled paper from his pocket.
Why, I always called you Nick in my heart, and though lost to sight, to memory dear.
But under the circumstances I will invite you to remain here for the night, and I will myself ride over here early to-morrow morning—before breakfast, in fact—when I can receive any communication you have to make to me.” “With all my heart,” said Raffles; “this is a comfortable place—a little dull for a continuance; but I can put up with it for a night, with this good liquor and the prospect of seeing you again in the morning.
You’re a much better host than my stepson was; but Josh owed me a bit of a grudge for marrying his mother; and between you and me there was never anything but kindness.” Mr. Bulstrode, hoping that the peculiar mixture of joviality and sneering in Raffles’ manner was a good deal the effect of drink, had determined to wait till he was quite sober before he spent more words upon him.
The fine old place never looked more like a delightful home than at that moment; the great white lilies were in flower, the nasturtiums, their pretty leaves all silvered with dew, were running away over the low stone wall; the very noises all around had a heart of peace within them.
I presume that you have a home elsewhere and will be glad to return to it.” “Why, if a man has got any heart, doesn’t he want to see an old friend, Nick?—I must call you Nick—we always did call you young Nick when we knew you meant to marry the old widow.
I’ve often thought since, I might have done better by telling the old woman that I’d found her daughter and her grandchild: it would have suited my feelings better; I’ve got a soft place in my heart.
I married when I came back—a nice woman in the tobacco trade—very fond of me—but the trade was restricted, as we say.
Dorothea would have been capable of carrying baby joyfully for a mile if there had been need, and of loving it the more tenderly for that labor; but to an aunt who does not recognize her infant nephew as Bouddha, and has nothing to do for him but to admire, his behavior is apt to appear monotonous, and the interest of watching him exhaustible.
Surely one may be sane and yet think so, since the greater part of the world has often had to come round from its opinion.” Mrs. Cadwallader said no more on that point to Dorothea, but to her husband she remarked, “It will be well for her to marry again as soon as it is proper, if one could get her among the right people.
At first she walked into every room, questioning the eighteen months of her married life, and carrying on her thoughts as if they were a speech to be heard by her husband.
“Let him be shown into the drawing-room.” The drawing-room was the most neutral room in the house to her—the one least associated with the trials of her married life: the damask matched the wood-work, which was all white and gold; there were two tall mirrors and tables with nothing on them—in brief, it was a room where you had no reason for sitting in one place rather than in another.
Mrs. Cadwallader’s maid says there’s a lord coming who is to marry her when the mourning’s over.” There were not many moments for Will to walk about with his hat in his hand before Dorothea entered.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>It would be more consoling if others wanted to have it.” “I thought you would like to cherish her memory—I thought—” Dorothea broke off an instant, her imagination suddenly warning her away from Aunt Julia’s history—“you would surely like to have the miniature as a family memorial.” “Why should I have that, when I have nothing else!
“But poverty may be as bad as leprosy, if it divides us from what we most care for.” The words cut Dorothea to the heart, and made her relent.
He was standing two yards from her with his mind full of contradictory desires and resolves—desiring some unmistakable proof that she loved him, and yet dreading the position into which such a proof might bring him.
Indeed, Sir James shrank with so much dislike from the association even in thought of Dorothea with Ladislaw as her possible lover, that he would himself have wished to avoid an outward show of displeasure which would have recognized the disagreeable possibility.
If any one had asked him why he shrank in that way, I am not sure that he would at first have said anything fuller or more precise than “_That_ Ladislaw!”—though on reflection he might have urged that Mr. Casaubon’s codicil, barring Dorothea’s marriage with Will, except under a penalty, was enough to cast unfitness over any relation at all between them.
For the first time she took down the miniature from the wall and kept it before her, liking to blend the woman who had been too hardly judged with the grandson whom her own heart and judgment defended.
“Dodo need not make such a slavery of her mourning; she need not wear that cap any more among her friends.” “My dear Celia,” said Lady Chettam, “a widow must wear her mourning at least a year.” “Not if she marries again before the end of it,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who had some pleasure in startling her good friend the Dowager.
“I am sure you would be the last woman to marry again prematurely, if our dear Rector were taken away.” “Oh, I make no vows; it might be a necessary economy.
It is lawful to marry again, I suppose; else we might as well be Hindoos instead of Christians.
But if she can marry blood, beauty, and bravery—the sooner the better.” “I think the subject of our conversation is very ill-chosen,” said Sir James, with a look of disgust.
“If you are speaking on my behalf, I can assure you that no question can be more indifferent and impersonal to me than second marriage.
She was step-daughter to Lord Grinsell: he married Mrs. Teveroy for his second wife.
A woman could not be married in a widow’s cap, James.” “Hush, my dear!” said Mrs. Cadwallader.
I should only mind if there were a law obliging me to take any piece of blood and beauty that she or anybody else recommended.” “But you know, Dodo, if you ever did marry, it would be all the better to have blood and beauty,” said Celia, reflecting that Mr. Casaubon had not been richly endowed with those gifts, and that it would be well to caution Dorothea in time.
I shall never marry again,” said Dorothea, touching her sister’s chin, and looking at her with indulgent affection.
“Perhaps little Arthur will like plans when he grows up, and then he can help you.” Sir James was informed that same night that Dorothea was really quite set against marrying anybody at all, and was going to take to “all sorts of plans,” just like what she used to have.
To his secret feeling there was something repulsive in a woman’s second marriage, and no match would prevent him from feeling it a sort of desecration for Dorothea.
He was aware that the world would regard such a sentiment as preposterous, especially in relation to a woman of one-and-twenty; the practice of “the world” being to treat of a young widow’s second marriage as certain and probably near, and to smile with meaning if the widow acts accordingly.
I’d soon knock the breath out on ye, I would.” “Wait a minute, and I’ll come back presently, and have a round with you all in turn, if you like,” said Fred, who felt confidence in his power of boxing with his dearly beloved brethren.
I’ll help you with pleasure—can I?” said Fred, with a sense that he should be courting Mary when he was helping her father.
“You must be sure of two things: you must love your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting your play to begin.
“I think you must know what I feel for Mary, Mr. Garth: I hope it does not displease you that I have always loved her better than any one else, and that I shall never love any one as I love her.” The expression of Caleb’s face was visibly softening while Fred spoke.
The lad loves Mary, and a true love for a good woman is a great thing, Susan.
But she assured me she would never marry an idle self-indulgent man—nothing since.
Fred’s heart is fixed on Mary, that I can see: it gives me a good opinion of the lad—and we always liked him, Susan.” “It is a pity for Mary, I think,” said Mrs. Garth.
But you took me, though I was a plain man.” “I took the best and cleverest man I had ever known,” said Mrs. Garth, convinced that _she_ would never have loved any one who came short of that mark.
The lad is good at bottom, and clever enough to do, if he’s put in the right way; and he loves and honors my daughter beyond anything, and she has given him a sort of promise according to what he turns out.
It came from the pressure of various feelings, in which there was much affection and some vexation.
I’ve got a clear feeling inside me, and that I shall follow; and I hope your heart will go with me, Susan, in making everything as light as can be to Mary, poor child.” Caleb, leaning back in his chair, looked with anxious appeal towards his wife.
She rose and kissed him, saying, “God bless you, Caleb!
How are you at writing and arithmetic?” Fred felt an awkward movement of the heart; he had not thought of desk-work; but he was in a resolute mood, and not going to shrink.
“I hope you will shake hands with me, father, and forgive me the vexation I have caused you.” Mr. Vincy from his chair threw a quick glance upward at his son, who had advanced near to him, and then gave his hand, saying hurriedly, “Yes, yes, let us say no more.” Fred went through much more narrative and explanation with his mother, but she was inconsolable, having before her eyes what perhaps her husband had never thought of, the certainty that Fred would marry Mary Garth, that her life would henceforth be spoiled by a perpetual infusion of Garths and their ways, and that her darling boy, with his beautiful face and stylish air “beyond anybody else’s son in Middlemarch,” would be sure to get like that family in plainness of appearance and carelessness about his clothes.
I never did like that marriage.
They numbered scarce eight summers when a name Rose on their souls and stirred such motions there As thrill the buds and shape their hidden frame At penetration of the quickening air: His name who told of loyal Evan Dhu, Of quaint Bradwardine, and Vich Ian Vor, Making the little world their childhood knew Large with a land of mountain lake and scaur, And larger yet with wonder, love, belief Toward Walter Scott who living far away Sent them this wealth of joy and noble grief.
He was lying on the ground now by his mother’s chair, with his straw hat laid flat over his eyes, while Jim on the other side was reading aloud from that beloved writer who has made a chief part in the happiness of many young lives.
You were not surprised, I dare say?” Fred ended, innocently referring only to his own love as probably evident enough.
For a moment Fred looked at the horizon with a dismayed anxiety, and then turning with a quick movement said almost sharply— “Do you mean to say, Mrs. Garth, that Mr. Farebrother is in love with Mary?” “And if it were so, Fred, I think you are the last person who ought to be surprised,” returned Mrs. Garth, laying her knitting down beside her and folding her arms.
But it was not in a lover’s nature—it was not in Fred’s, that the new anxiety raised about Mary’s feeling should not surmount every other.
You are sure to marry Farebrother at last.” There was some rage in his tone.
If you were not such a charming simpleton, what a temptation this would be to play the wicked coquette, and let you suppose that somebody besides you has made love to me.” “Do you really like me best, Mary?” said Fred, turning eyes full of affection on her, and trying to take her hand.
“I only said that no mortal ever made love to me besides you.
I am disappointed that you should be so blind to his delicate feeling.” There was no time to say any more before Mr. Farebrother came back with the engraving; and Fred had to return to the drawing-room still with a jealous dread in his heart, but yet with comforting arguments from Mary’s words and manner.
To have a reason for going home the next day was a relief, for Mary earnestly desired to be always clear that she loved Fred best.
When a tender affection has been storing itself in us through many of our years, the idea that we could accept any exchange for it seems to be a cheapening of our lives.
“For there can live no hatred in thine eye, Therefore in that I cannot know thy change: In many’s looks the false heart’s history Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange: But Heaven in thy creation did decree That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell: Whate’er thy thoughts or thy heart’s workings be Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.” —SHAKESPEARE: _Sonnets_.
The satisfaction was enough for the time to melt away some disappointment in the conditions of marriage with a medical man even of good birth: it seemed now that her marriage was visibly as well as ideally floating her above the Middlemarch level, and the future looked bright with letters and visits to and from Quallingham, and vague advancement in consequence for Tertius.
Especially as, probably at the Captain’s suggestion, his married sister, Mrs. Mengan, had come with her maid, and stayed two nights on her way from town.
Rosamond delighted in his admiration now even more than she had done at Quallingham, and he found it easy to spend several hours of the day in flirting with her.
Those words of Lydgate’s were like a sad milestone marking how far he had travelled from his old dreamland, in which Rosamond Vincy appeared to be that perfect piece of womanhood who would reverence her husband’s mind after the fashion of an accomplished mermaid, using her comb and looking-glass and singing her song for the relaxation of his adored wisdom alone.
He had begun to distinguish between that imagined adoration and the attraction towards a man’s talent because it gives him prestige, and is like an order in his button-hole or an Honorable before his name.
); and what could he do then but kiss the exquisite nape which was shown in all its delicate curves?
The temptation was certainly great: she was very fond of the exercise, and the gratification of riding on a fine horse, with Captain Lydgate, Sir Godwin’s son, on another fine horse by her side, and of being met in this position by any one but her husband, was something as good as her dreams before marriage: moreover she was riveting the connection with the family at Quallingham, which must be a wise thing to do.
Lydgate was astounded to find in numberless trifling matters, as well as in this last serious case of the riding, that affection did not make her compliant.
He had no doubt that the affection was there, and had no presentiment that he had done anything to repel it.
For his own part he said to himself that he loved her as tenderly as ever, and could make up his mind to her negations; but—well!
When a man in setting up a house and preparing for marriage finds that his furniture and other initial expenses come to between four and five hundred pounds more than he has capital to pay for; when at the end of a year it appears that his household expenses, horses and et caeteras, amount to nearly a thousand, while the proceeds of the practice reckoned from the old books to be worth eight hundred per annum have sunk like a summer pond and make hardly five hundred, chiefly in unpaid entries, the plain inference is that, whether he minds it or not, he is in debt.
Two furnishing tradesmen at Brassing, whose bills had been incurred before his marriage, and whom uncalculated current expenses had ever since prevented him from paying, had repeatedly sent him unpleasant letters which had forced themselves on his attention.
He had scorned even to form conjectures about Mr. Vincy’s intentions on money matters, and nothing but extremity could have induced him to apply to his father-in-law, even if he had not been made aware in various indirect ways since his marriage that Mr. Vincy’s own affairs were not flourishing, and that the expectation of help from him would be resented.
It touched Lydgate now, and mingled the early moments of his love for her with all the other memories which were stirred in this crisis of deep trouble.
He laid his ample hand softly on hers, saying— “Dear!” with the lingering utterance which affection gives to the word.
“I was not able to pay for all the things we had to get before we were married, and there have been expenses since which I have been obliged to meet.
He did not storm in indignation—he felt too sad a sinking of the heart.
But he did wish to spare her as much as he could, and her tears cut him to the heart.
The thought in her mind was that if she had known how Lydgate would behave, she would never have married him.
Kiss me.” His native warm-heartedness took a great deal of quenching, and it is a part of manliness for a husband to feel keenly the fact that an inexperienced girl has got into trouble by marrying him.
She received his kiss and returned it faintly, and in this way an appearance of accord was recovered for the time.
Fred and Rosamond had little to say to each other now that marriage had removed her from collision with the unpleasantness of brothers, and especially now that he had taken what she held the stupid and even reprehensible step of giving up the Church to take to such a business as Mr. Garth’s.
“It is really the most charming romance: Mr. Casaubon jealous, and foreseeing that there was no one else whom Mrs. Casaubon would so much like to marry, and no one who would so much like to marry her as a certain gentleman; and then laying a plan to spoil all by making her forfeit her property if she did marry that gentleman—and then—and then—and then—oh, I have no doubt the end will be thoroughly romantic.” “Great God!
“Don’t know that Mr. Casaubon has left it in his will that if Mrs. Casaubon marries you she is to forfeit all her property?” “How do you know that it is true?” said Will, eagerly.
“I expect to hear of the marriage,” said Rosamond, playfully.
You will never hear of the marriage!” With those words uttered impetuously, Will rose, put out his hand to Rosamond, still with the air of a somnambulist, and went away.
It was only an act of benevolence which your noble heart would approve.
“Sit down and let me sponge it with vinegar.” Physically Mr. Bulstrode did not want the vinegar, but morally the affectionate attention soothed him.
That her husband had at first been employed in a bank, that he had afterwards entered into what he called city business and gained a fortune before he was three-and-thirty, that he had married a widow who was much older than himself—a Dissenter, and in other ways probably of that disadvantageous quality usually perceptible in a first wife if inquired into with the dispassionate judgment of a second—was almost as much as she had cared to learn beyond the glimpses which Mr. Bulstrode’s narrative occasionally gave of his early bent towards religion, his inclination to be a preacher, and his association with missionary and philanthropic efforts.
He was quite aware of this; indeed in some respects he was rather afraid of this ingenuous wife, whose imitative piety and native worldliness were equally sincere, who had nothing to be ashamed of, and whom he had married out of a thorough inclination still subsisting.
On the contrary, he felt a cold certainty at his heart that Raffles—unless providence sent death to hinder him—would come back to Middlemarch before long.
Soon he became an intimate there, honored for his piety by the wife, marked out for his ability by the husband, whose wealth was due to a flourishing city and west-end trade.
The wife, a simple pious woman, left with all the wealth in and out of the magnificent trade, of which she never knew the precise nature, had come to believe in Bulstrode, and innocently adore him as women often adore their priest or “man-made” minister.
It was natural that after a time marriage should have been thought of between them.
It was known that the daughter had married, but she was utterly gone out of sight.
Efforts to find her must be made before Mrs. Dunkirk would marry again.
Bulstrode concurred; but after advertisement as well as other modes of inquiry had been tried, the mother believed that her daughter was not to be found, and consented to marry without reservation of property.
He was a squyer of lowe degre, That loved the king’s daughter of Hungrie.
He knew nothing of Dorothea’s private fortune, and being little used to reflect on such matters, took it for granted that according to Mr. Casaubon’s arrangement marriage to him, Will Ladislaw, would mean that she consented to be penniless.
That was not what he could wish for even in his secret heart, or even if she had been ready to meet such hard contrast for his sake.
But it is a pity that young Lydgate should have married one of these Middlemarch girls.
Dorothea’s heart seemed to turn over as if it had had a blow, but she was not perceptibly checked: in truth, the sense that Will was there was for the moment all-satisfying to her, like the sight of something precious that one has lost.
Her whole heart was going out at this moment in sympathy with Will’s indignation: she only wanted to convince him that she had never done him injustice, and he seemed to have turned away from her as if she too had been part of the unfriendly world.
At this moment she had no belief that Will would in any case have wanted to marry her, and she feared using words which might imply such a belief.
What could he say, since what had got obstinately uppermost in his mind was the passionate love for her which he forbade himself to utter?
Yet, after all, had she any love for him?—he could not pretend to himself that he would rather believe her to be without that pain.
He could not deny that a secret longing for the assurance that she loved him was at the root of all his words.
“The day after to-morrow I shall leave Middlemarch.” “You have acted in every way rightly,” said Dorothea, in a low tone, feeling a pressure at her heart which made it difficult to speak.
Joy came first, in spite of the threatening train behind it—joy in the impression that it was really herself whom Will loved and was renouncing, that there was really no other love less permissible, more blameworthy, which honor was hurrying him away from.
At that moment the parting was easy to bear: the first sense of loving and being loved excluded sorrow.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>After all, he had no assurance that she loved him: could any man pretend that he was simply glad in such a case to have the suffering all on his own side?
“I suppose his relations in the North back him up.” “I hope so,” said Mr. Chichely, “else he ought not to have married that nice girl we were all so fond of.
“My friend Vincy didn’t half like the marriage, I know that,” said Mr. Chichely.
This was not the first time that Mr. Farebrother had heard hints of Lydgate’s expenses being obviously too great to be met by his practice, but he thought it not unlikely that there were resources or expectations which excused the large outlay at the time of Lydgate’s marriage, and which might hinder any bad consequences from the disappointment in his practice.
“He may have been taking an opiate,” was a thought that crossed Mr. Farebrother’s mind—“tic-douloureux perhaps—or medical worries.” It did not occur to him that Lydgate’s marriage was not delightful: he believed, as the rest did, that Rosamond was an amiable, docile creature, though he had always thought her rather uninteresting—a little too much the pattern-card of the finishing-school; and his mother could not forgive Rosamond because she never seemed to see that Henrietta Noble was in the room.
“However, Lydgate fell in love with her,” said the Vicar to himself, “and she must be to his taste.” Mr. Farebrother was aware that Lydgate was a proud man, but having very little corresponding fibre in himself, and perhaps too little care about personal dignity, except the dignity of not being mean or foolish, he could hardly allow enough for the way in which Lydgate shrank, as from a burn, from the utterance of any word about his private affairs.
Rosamond was perfectly graceful and calm, and only a subtle observation such as the Vicar had not been roused to bestow on her would have perceived the total absence of that interest in her husband’s presence which a loving wife is sure to betray, even if etiquette keeps her aloof from him.
Mary was just finishing the delicious tale of Rumpelstiltskin, which she had well by heart, because Letty was never tired of communicating it to her ignorant elders from a favorite red volume.
But it is the easier for a man to wait patiently when he has friends who love him, and ask for nothing better than to help him through, so far as it lies in their power.” “Oh yes,” said Lydgate, in a careless tone, changing his attitude and looking at his watch.
He was not an ill-tempered man; his intellectual activity, the ardent kindness of his heart, as well as his strong frame, would always, under tolerably easy conditions, have kept him above the petty uncontrolled susceptibilities which make bad temper.
But we married because we loved each other, I suppose.
Come, dear, put down that work and come to me.” He was really in chill gloom about her at that moment, but he dreaded a future without affection, and was determined to resist the oncoming of division between them.
I hear that young Ned Plymdale is going to be married to Miss Sophy Toller.
His marriage would be a mere piece of bitter irony if they could not go on loving each other.
The first great disappointment had been borne: the tender devotedness and docile adoration of the ideal wife must be renounced, and life must be taken up on a lower stage of expectation, as it is by men who have lost their limbs.
But the real wife had not only her claims, she had still a hold on his heart, and it was his intense desire that the hold should remain strong.
In marriage, the certainty, “She will never love me much,” is easier to bear than the fear, “I shall love her no more.” Hence, after that outburst, his inward effort was entirely to excuse her, and to blame the hard circumstances which were partly his fault.
He tried that evening, by petting her, to heal the wound he had made in the morning, and it was not in Rosamond’s nature to be repellent or sulky; indeed, she welcomed the signs that her husband loved her and was under control.
But this was something quite distinct from loving _him_.
No time must be lost.” He took Rosamond’s question as a sign that she withdrew her inward opposition, and kissed her head caressingly when he got up to go away.
As soon as it was late enough to make a call, Rosamond went to Mrs. Plymdale, Mr. Ned’s mother, and entered with pretty congratulations into the subject of the coming marriage.
It is well known that your aunt Bulstrode and I have been intimate from our youth, and Mr. Plymdale has been always on Mr. Bulstrode’s side.
Since the Captain’s visit, she had received a letter from him, and also one from Mrs. Mengan, his married sister, condoling with her on the loss of her baby, and expressing vaguely the hope that they should see her again at Quallingham.
Only half an hour before he had been fastening up her plaits for her, and talking the “little language” of affection, which Rosamond, though not returning it, accepted as if she had been a serene and lovely image, now and then miraculously dimpling towards her votary.
But I think you ought to have told me before we were married that you would place me in the worst position, rather than give up your own will.” Lydgate did not speak, but tossed his head on one side, and twitched the corners of his mouth in despair.
“When we were married everyone felt that your position was very high.
But he not only dreaded the effect of such extremities on their mutual life—he had a growing dread of Rosamond’s quiet elusive obstinacy, which would not allow any assertion of power to be final; and again, she had touched him in a spot of keenest feeling by implying that she had been deluded with a false vision of happiness in marrying him.
Poor Rosamond for months had begun to associate her husband with feelings of disappointment, and the terribly inflexible relation of marriage had lost its charm of encouraging delightful dreams.
The Lydgate with whom she had been in love had been a group of airy conditions for her, most of which had disappeared, while their place had been taken by every-day details which must be lived through slowly from hour to hour, not floated through with a rapid selection of favorable aspects.
There was another presence which ever since the early days of her marriage, until four months ago, had been an agreeable excitement, but that was gone: Rosamond would not confess to herself how much the consequent blank had to do with her utter ennui; and it seemed to her (perhaps she was right) that an invitation to Quallingham, and an opening for Lydgate to settle elsewhere than in Middlemarch—in London, or somewhere likely to be free from unpleasantness—would satisfy her quite well, and make her indifferent to the absence of Will Ladislaw, towards whom she felt some resentment for his exaltation of Mrs. Casaubon.
Your affectionate uncle, GODWIN LYDGATE.” When Rosamond had finished reading the letter she sat quite still, with her hands folded before her, restraining any show of her keen disappointment, and intrenching herself in quiet passivity under her husband’s wrath.
I shall at least know what I am doing then.” It is a terrible moment in young lives when the closeness of love’s bond has turned to this power of galling.
I think it was to be expected that I should try to avert some of the hardships which our marriage has brought on me.” Another tear fell as Rosamond ceased speaking, and she pressed it away as quietly as the first.
Rosamond had the double purchase over him of insensibility to the point of justice in his reproach, and of sensibility to the undeniable hardships now present in her married life.
He had begun to have an alarmed foresight of her irrevocable loss of love for him, and the consequent dreariness of their life.
“You have not made my life pleasant to me of late”—“the hardships which our marriage has brought on me”—these words were stinging his imagination as a pain makes an exaggerated dream.
Under the first galling pressure of foreseen difficulties, and the first perception that his marriage, if it were not to be a yoked loneliness, must be a state of effort to go on loving without too much care about being loved, he had once or twice tried a dose of opium.
“Clearly not, when her affection met yours.
I can easily conceive that you might act in a way to loosen the tie she feels towards you—it must be remembered that she is only conditionally bound to you—and that in that case, another man, who may flatter himself that he has a hold on her regard, might succeed in winning that firm place in her love as well as respect which you had let slip.
Set your heart at rest, that if you keep right, other things will keep right.” “I shall never forget what you have done,” Fred answered.
Much of Fred’s rumination might be summed up in the words, “It certainly would have been a fine thing for her to marry Farebrother—but if she loves me best and I am a good husband?” Perhaps Mr. Farebrother’s might be concentrated into a single shrug and one little speech.
It was true that of late there had seemed to be a new languor of interest in Bulstrode about the Hospital; but his health had got worse, and showed signs of a deep-seated nervous affection.
In other respects he did not appear to be changed: he had always been highly polite, but Lydgate had observed in him from the first a marked coldness about his marriage and other private circumstances, a coldness which he had hitherto preferred to any warmth of familiarity between them.
“But I can’t be expected to rejoice in it at once, since one of the first results will be that the other medical men will upset or interrupt my methods, if it were only because they are mine.” “I myself, as you know, Mr. Lydgate, highly valued the opportunity of new and independent procedure which you have diligently employed: the original plan, I confess, was one which I had much at heart, under submission to the Divine Will.
My expenses, in consequence of my marriage, have been very much greater than I had expected.
And then the children might be married by-and-by, Susan.” “You will not give any hint of the plan to Fred, until you are sure that Bulstrode would agree to the plan?” said Mrs. Garth, in a tone of gentle caution.
“And as to marriage, Caleb, we old people need not help to hasten it.” “Oh, I don’t know,” said Caleb, swinging his head aside.
I cannot be expected to take care of his married children.” That seemed to be true, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s remonstrance subsided into pity for poor Rosamond, whose extravagant education she had always foreseen the fruits of.
Caleb was so elated with his hope of this “neat turn” being given to things, that if his self-control had not been braced by a little affectionate wifely scolding, he would have betrayed everything to Mary, wanting “to give the child comfort.” However, he restrained himself, and kept in strict privacy from Fred certain visits which he was making to Stone Court, in order to look more thoroughly into the state of the land and stock, and take a preliminary estimate.
That Raffles should be afflicted with illness, that he should have been led to Stone Court rather than elsewhere—Bulstrode’s heart fluttered at the vision of probabilities which these events conjured up.
Bulstrode’s heart sank again at this sign that he could get no grasp over the wretched man’s mind, and that no word of Raffles could be trusted as to the fact which he most wanted to know, namely, whether or not he had really kept silence to every one in the neighborhood except Caleb Garth.
He had not been there since his first interview with Bulstrode in the morning, having been found at the Hospital by the banker’s messenger; and for the first time he was returning to his home without the vision of any expedient in the background which left him a hope of raising money enough to deliver him from the coming destitution of everything which made his married life tolerable—everything which saved him and Rosamond from that bare isolation in which they would be forced to recognize how little of a comfort they could be to each other.
He had never liked the makeshifts of poverty, and they had never before entered into his prospects for himself; but he was beginning now to imagine how two creatures who loved each other, and had a stock of thoughts in common, might laugh over their shabby furniture, and their calculations how far they could afford butter and eggs.
Let us only love one another.” She looked at him silently, still with the blank despair on her face; but then the tears began to fill her blue eyes, and her lip trembled.
No ideas or opinions could hinder him from seeing the one probability to be, that Raffles recovered would be just the same man as before, with his strength as a tormentor renewed, obliging him to drag away his wife to spend her years apart from her friends and native place, carrying an alienating suspicion against him in her heart.
He had set out on his work with all his old animation, and felt himself strong enough to bear all the deficiencies of his married life.
Whatever certain dissatisfactions in marriage, which some silly tinklings of gossip had given him hints of, might have to do with this change, Mr. Farebrother felt sure that it was chiefly connected with the debts which were being more and more distinctly reported, and he began to fear that any notion of Lydgate’s having resources or friends in the background must be quite illusory.
Forgive me if I take a liberty.” “I don’t believe you will ask anything that ought to offend me.” “Then—this is necessary to set my heart quite at rest—you have not—have you?—in order to pay your debts, incurred another debt which may harass you worse hereafter?” “No,” said Lydgate, coloring slightly.
But Mr. Farebrother, whose hopes entered strongly into the same current with Lydgate’s, and who knew nothing about him that could now raise a melancholy presentiment, left him with affectionate congratulation.
How it had been brought to her she didn’t know, but it was there before her as if it had been “scored with the chalk on the chimney-board—” as Bulstrode should say, “his inside was _that black_ as if the hairs of his head knowed the thoughts of his heart, he’d tear ’em up by the roots.” “That’s odd,” said Mr. Limp, a meditative shoemaker, with weak eyes and a piping voice.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>But Sir James Chettam was no longer the diffident and acquiescent suitor: he was the anxious brother-in-law, with a devout admiration for his sister, but with a constant alarm lest she should fall under some new illusion almost as bad as marrying Casaubon.
His marriage seemed an unmitigated calamity; and he was afraid of going to Rosamond before he had vented himself in this solitary rage, lest the mere sight of her should exasperate him and make him behave unwarrantably.
No feminine intimate might carry her friendship so far as to make a plain statement to the wife of the unpleasant fact known or believed about her husband; but when a woman with her thoughts much at leisure got them suddenly employed on something grievously disadvantageous to her neighbors, various moral impulses were called into play which tended to stimulate utterance.
Then, again, there was the love of truth—a wide phrase, but meaning in this relation, a lively objection to seeing a wife look happier than her husband’s character warranted, or manifest too much satisfaction in her lot—the poor thing should have some hint given her that if she knew the truth she would have less complacency in her bonnet, and in light dishes for a supper-party.
She’s as honest as the day—_she_ never suspected anything wrong in him, you may depend on it.” Women, who were intimate with her, talked together much of “poor Harriet,” imagined what her feelings must be when she came to know everything, and conjectured how much she had already come to know.
Rosamond was more severely criticised and less pitied, though she too, as one of the good old Vincy family who had always been known in Middlemarch, was regarded as a victim to marriage with an interloper.
“It’s true Mr. Plymdale has always been on good terms with Mr. Bulstrode, and Harriet Vincy was my friend long before she married him.
I pity her from my heart.
But she got that from her mother; she never got it from her aunt Bulstrode, who always gave her good advice, and to my knowledge would rather have had her marry elsewhere.” Mrs. Plymdale was in a situation which caused her some complication of feeling.
Without that memory of Raffles she might still have thought only of monetary ruin, but now along with her brother’s look and words there darted into her mind the idea of some guilt in her husband—then, under the working of terror came the image of her husband exposed to disgrace—and then, after an instant of scorching shame in which she felt only the eyes of the world, with one leap of her heart she was at his side in mournful but unreproaching fellowship with shame and isolation.
He had married her with that bad past life hidden behind him, and she had no faith left to protest his innocence of the worst that was imputed to him.
Perhaps he should never see his wife’s face with affection in it again.
But she was not joyous: her married life had fulfilled none of her hopes, and had been quite spoiled for her imagination.
Rosamond took his way of talking to herself, which was a mixture of playful fault-finding and hyperbolical gallantry, as the disguise of a deeper feeling; and in his presence she felt that agreeable titillation of vanity and sense of romantic drama which Lydgate’s presence had no longer the magic to create.
No notion could have been falser than this, for Rosamond’s discontent in her marriage was due to the conditions of marriage itself, to its demand for self-suppression and tolerance, and not to the nature of her husband; but the easy conception of an unreal Better had a sentimental charm which diverted her ennui.
She constructed a little romance which was to vary the flatness of her life: Will Ladislaw was always to be a bachelor and live near her, always to be at her command, and have an understood though never fully expressed passion for her, which would be sending out lambent flames every now and then in interesting scenes.
Since then the troubles of her married life had deepened, and the absence of other relief encouraged her regretful rumination over that thin romance which she had once fed on.
Men and women make sad mistakes about their own symptoms, taking their vague uneasy longings, sometimes for genius, sometimes for religion, and oftener still for a mighty love.
To think of your marrying into this trouble.
It seemed to her that no lot could be so cruelly hard as hers to have married a man who had become the centre of infamous suspicions.
And she had innocently married this man with the belief that he and his family were a glory to her!
It came into her mind once that she would ask her father to let her go home again; but dwelling on that prospect made it seem utter dreariness to her: a married woman gone back to live with her parents—life seemed to have no meaning for her in such a position: she could not contemplate herself in it.
I have married care, not help.” And that evening he said— “Rosamond, have you heard anything that distresses you?” “Yes,” she answered, laying down her work, which she had been carrying on with a languid semi-consciousness, most unlike her usual self.
To mercy, pity, peace, and love All pray in their distress, And to these virtues of delight, Return their thankfulness.
. . . . . . For Mercy has a human heart, Pity a human face; And Love, the human form divine; And Peace, the human dress.
They all owed their significance to her marriage and its troubles—but no; there were two occasions in which the image of Lydgate had come painfully in connection with his wife and some one else.
The pain had been allayed for Dorothea, but it had left in her an awakened conjecture as to what Lydgate’s marriage might be to him, a susceptibility to the slightest hint about Mrs. Lydgate.
“Not because there is no one to believe in you?” said Dorothea, pouring out her words in clearness from a full heart.
There is no sorrow I have thought more about than that—to love what is great, and try to reach it, and yet to fail.” “Yes,” said Lydgate, feeling that here he had found room for the full meaning of his grief.
At last he turned towards her and said impetuously— “Why should I not tell you?—you know what sort of bond marriage is.
You will understand everything.” Dorothea felt her heart beginning to beat faster.
She married me without knowing what she was going into, and it might have been better for her if she had not married me.” “I know, I know—you could not give her pain, if you were not obliged to do it,” said Dorothea, with keen memory of her own life.
I would cheer her heart.
“I hope she will like me.” As Lydgate rode away, he thought, “This young creature has a heart large enough for the Virgin Mary.
Well—her love might help a man more than her money.” Dorothea on her side had immediately formed a plan of relieving Lydgate from his obligation to Bulstrode, which she felt sure was a part, though small, of the galling pressure he had to bear.
Until yesterday when Lydgate had opened to her a glimpse of some trouble in his married life, the image of Mrs. Lydgate had always been associated for her with that of Will Ladislaw.
But there had followed his parting words—the few passionate words in which he had implied that she herself was the object of whom his love held him in dread, that it was his love for her only which he was resolved not to declare but to carry away into banishment.
From the time of that parting, Dorothea, believing in Will’s love for her, believing with a proud delight in his delicate sense of honor and his determination that no one should impeach him justly, felt her heart quite at rest as to the regard he might have for Mrs. Lydgate.
There are natures in which, if they love us, we are conscious of having a sort of baptism and consecration: they bind us over to rectitude and purity by their pure belief about us; and our sins become that worst kind of sacrilege which tears down the invisible altar of trust.
She had an active force of antagonism within her, when the antagonism turned on the defence either of plans or persons that she believed in; and the wrongs which she felt that Will had received from her husband, and the external conditions which to others were grounds for slighting him, only gave the more tenacity to her affection and admiring judgment.
She had accepted her whole relation to Will very simply as part of her marriage sorrows, and would have thought it very sinful in her to keep up an inward wail because she was not completely happy, being rather disposed to dwell on the superfluities of her lot.
She could bear that the chief pleasures of her tenderness should lie in memory, and the idea of marriage came to her solely as a repulsive proposition from some suitor of whom she at present knew nothing, but whose merits, as seen by her friends, would be a source of torment to her:—“somebody who will manage your property for you, my dear,” was Mr. Brooke’s attractive suggestion of suitable characteristics.
No—she adhered to her declaration that she would never be married again, and in the long valley of her life which looked so flat and empty of waymarks, guidance would come as she walked along the road, and saw her fellow-passengers by the way.
And she would carry out the purpose with which she had started in the morning, of going to Freshitt and Tipton to tell Sir James and her uncle all that she wished them to know about Lydgate, whose married loneliness under his trial now presented itself to her with new significance, and made her more ardent in readiness to be his champion.
She had never felt anything like this triumphant power of indignation in the struggle of her married life, in which there had always been a quickly subduing pang; and she took it as a sign of new strength.
Even Tertius, that most perverse of men, was always subdued in the long-run: events had been obstinate, but still Rosamond would have said now, as she did before her marriage, that she never gave up what she had set her mind on.
And what seemed a foreboding was pressing upon him as with slow pincers:—that his life might come to be enslaved by this helpless woman who had thrown herself upon him in the dreary sadness of her heart.
The box was found at last under a chiffonier, and Miss Noble grasped it with delight, saying, “it was under a fender the last time.” “That is an affair of the heart with my aunt,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling at Dorothea, as he reseated himself.
She was surprised and annoyed to find that her heart was palpitating violently, and that it was quite useless to try after a recovery of her former animation.
Dismissing Tantripp with a few faint words, she locked her door, and turning away from it towards the vacant room she pressed her hands hard on the top of her head, and moaned out— “Oh, I did love him!” Then came the hour in which the waves of suffering shook her too thoroughly to leave any power of thought.
She could only cry in loud whispers, between her sobs, after her lost belief which she had planted and kept alive from a very little seed since the days in Rome—after her lost joy of clinging with silent love and faith to one who, misprized by others, was worthy in her thought—after her lost woman’s pride of reigning in his memory—after her sweet dim perspective of hope, that along some pathway they should meet with unchanged recognition and take up the backward years as a yesterday.
There were two images—two living forms that tore her heart in two, as if it had been the heart of a mother who seems to see her child divided by the sword, and presses one bleeding half to her breast while her gaze goes forth in agony towards the half which is carried away by the lying woman that has never known the mother’s pang.
He knew that he was deluding her—wished, in the very moment of farewell, to make her believe that he gave her the whole price of her heart, and knew that he had spent it half before.
But that base prompting which makes a women more cruel to a rival than to a faithless lover, could have no strength of recurrence in Dorothea when the dominant spirit of justice within her had once overcome the tumult and had once shown her the truer measure of things.
All the active thought with which she had before been representing to herself the trials of Lydgate’s lot, and this young marriage union which, like her own, seemed to have its hidden as well as evident troubles—all this vivid sympathetic experience returned to her now as a power: it asserted itself as acquired knowledge asserts itself and will not let us see as we saw in the day of our ignorance.
At least, that’s _my_ thinking,” ended Tantripp, looking anxiously at the fire; “and if anybody was to marry me flattering himself I should wear those hijeous weepers two years for him, he’d be deceived by his own vanity, that’s all.” “The fire will do, my good Tan,” said Dorothea, speaking as she used to do in the old Lausanne days, only with a very low voice; “get me the coffee.” She folded herself in the large chair, and leaned her head against it in fatigued quiescence, while Tantripp went away wondering at this strange contrariness in her young mistress—that just the morning when she had more of a widow’s face than ever, she should have asked for her lighter mourning which she had waived before.
But Dorothea had counted a little too much on her own strength: the clearness and intensity of her mental action this morning were the continuance of a nervous exaltation which made her frame as dangerously responsive as a bit of finest Venetian crystal; and in looking at Rosamond, she suddenly found her heart swelling, and was unable to speak—all her effort was required to keep back tears.
Trouble is so hard to bear, is it not?— How can we live and think that any one has trouble—piercing trouble—and we could help them, and never try?” Dorothea, completely swayed by the feeling that she was uttering, forgot everything but that she was speaking from out the heart of her own trial to Rosamond’s.
“What he said of you was, that he could not be happy in doing anything which made you unhappy—that his marriage was of course a bond which must affect his choice about everything; and for that reason he refused my proposal that he should keep his position at the Hospital, because that would bind him to stay in Middlemarch, and he would not undertake to do anything which would be painful to you.
He could say that to me, because he knows that I had much trial in my marriage, from my husband’s illness, which hindered his plans and saddened him; and he knows that I have felt how hard it is to walk always in fear of hurting another who is tied to us.” Dorothea waited a little; she had discerned a faint pleasure stealing over Rosamond’s face.
Even if we loved some one else better than—than those we were married to, it would be no use”—poor Dorothea, in her palpitating anxiety, could only seize her language brokenly—“I mean, marriage drinks up all our power of giving or getting any blessedness in that sort of love.
I know it may be very dear—but it murders our marriage—and then the marriage stays with us like a murder—and everything else is gone.
And then our husband—if he loved and trusted us, and we have not helped him, but made a curse in his life—” Her voice had sunk very low: there was a dread upon her of presuming too far, and of speaking as if she herself were perfection addressing error.
“He was telling me how he loved another woman, that I might know he could never love me,” said Rosamond, getting more and more hurried as she went on.
He has never had any love for me—I know he has not—he has always thought slightly of me.
Her immediate consciousness was one of immense sympathy without check; she cared for Rosamond without struggle now, and responded earnestly to her last words— “No, he cannot reproach you any more.” With her usual tendency to over-estimate the good in others, she felt a great outgoing of her heart towards Rosamond, for the generous effort which had redeemed her from suffering, not counting that the effort was a reflex of her own energy.
He loves you best.
She tried to thrust away the too overpowering thought of her own relief, lest she should fail to win some sign that Rosamond’s affection was yearning back towards her husband.
I have always been accused of being immoderate and saying too much.” She put out her hand to Rosamond, and they said an earnest, quiet good-by without kiss or other show of effusion: there had been between them too much serious emotion for them to use the signs of it superficially.
“And now good-morrow to our waking souls Which watch not one another out of fear; For love all love of other sights controls, And makes one little room, an everywhere.” —DR.
Resistance to unjust dispraise had mingled with her feeling for him from the very first, and now in the rebound of her heart after her anguish the resistance was stronger than ever.
“If I love him too much it is because he has been used so ill:”—there was a voice within her saying this to some imagined audience in the library, when the door was opened, and she saw Will before her.
She knew that he had avowed his love for her.
“Nothing could have changed me but—” her heart was swelling, and it was difficult to go on; she made a great effort over herself to say in a low tremulous voice, “but thinking that you were different—not so good as I had believed you to be.” “You are sure to believe me better than I am in everything but one,” said Will, giving way to his own feeling in the evidence of hers.
I thought it was all over with me, and there was nothing to try for—only things to endure.” “I don’t doubt you any longer,” said Dorothea, putting out her hand; a vague fear for him impelling her unutterable affection.
Since I must go away—since we must always be divided—you may think of me as one on the brink of the grave.” While he was speaking there came a vivid flash of lightning which lit each of them up for the other—and the light seemed to be the terror of a hopeless love.
“Even if you loved me as well as I love you—even if I were everything to you—I shall most likely always be very poor: on a sober calculation, one can count on nothing but a creeping lot.
It was never known which lips were the first to move towards the other lips; but they kissed tremblingly, and then they moved apart.
It is unkind—it is throwing back my love for you as if it were a trifle, to speak in that way in the face of the fact.
Dorothea’s heart was full of something that she wanted to say, and yet the words were too difficult.
At last he turned, still resting against the chair, and stretching his hand automatically towards his hat, said with a sort of exasperation, “Good-by.” “Oh, I cannot bear it—my heart will break,” said Dorothea, starting from her seat, the flood of her young passion bearing down all the obstructions which had kept her silent—the great tears rising and falling in an instant: “I don’t mind about poverty—I hate my wealth.” In an instant Will was close to her and had his arms round her, but she drew her head back and held his away gently that she might go on speaking, her large tear-filled eyes looking at his very simply, while she said in a sobbing childlike way, “We could live quite well on my own fortune—it is too much—seven hundred a-year—I want so little—no new clothes—and I will learn what everything costs.” CHAPTER LXXXIV.
Mrs. Cadwallader was strong on the intended creation of peers: she had it for certain from her cousin that Truberry had gone over to the other side entirely at the instigation of his wife, who had scented peerages in the air from the very first introduction of the Reform question, and would sign her soul away to take precedence of her younger sister, who had married a baronet.
Celia had slipped her arm through her uncle’s, and he patted her hand with a rather melancholy “Well, my dear!” As they approached, it was evident that Mr. Brooke was looking dejected, but this was fully accounted for by the state of politics; and as he was shaking hands all round without more greeting than a “Well, you’re all here, you know,” the Rector said, laughingly— “Don’t take the throwing out of the Bill so much to heart, Brooke; you’ve got all the riff-raff of the country on your side.” “The Bill, eh?
You have a soft place in your heart yourself, you know—you’re not a Draco, a Jeffreys, that sort of thing.” Mr. Brooke was evidently in a state of nervous perturbation.
“But _what_ is worse?” “Dorothea is going to be married again, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, nodding towards Celia, who immediately looked up at her husband with a frightened glance, and put her hand on his knee.
We are indebted to that for seeing a woman like Dorothea degrading herself by marrying him.” Sir James made little stoppages between his clauses, the words not coming easily.
“I think that Dorothea commits a wrong action in marrying Ladislaw.” “My dear fellow, we are rather apt to consider an act wrong because it is unpleasant to us,” said the Rector, quietly.
“She said she _never would_ marry again—not anybody at all.” “I heard her say the same thing myself,” said Lady Chettam, majestically, as if this were royal evidence.
The mass of his feeling about Dorothea’s marriage to Ladislaw was due partly to excusable prejudice, or even justifiable opinion, partly to a jealous repugnance hardly less in Ladislaw’s case than in Casaubon’s.
He was convinced that the marriage was a fatal one for Dorothea.
But Celia was glad to have room for speech after her uncle’s suggestion of the marriage ceremony, and she said, though with as little eagerness of manner as if the question had turned on an invitation to dinner, “Do you mean that Dodo is going to be married directly, uncle?” “In three weeks, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, helplessly.
Nobody would have said anything if she had married the young fellow because he was rich.
“Not if she gave up marrying?” “What is the use of saying that?—however, I’m going to the stables.
How could any one understand Dodo so well as Celia did or love her so tenderly?
Dorothea, busy in her boudoir, felt a glow of pleasure at the sight of her sister so soon after the revelation of her intended marriage.
And how _can_ you marry Mr. Ladislaw, that we none of us ever thought you _could_ marry?
You would have Mr. Casaubon because he had such a great soul, and was so old and dismal and learned; and now, to think of marrying Mr. Ladislaw, who has got no estate or anything.
But you always were wrong: only I can’t help loving you.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“Take comfort: perhaps James will forgive me some time.” “But it would be much better if you would not be married,” said Celia, drying her eyes, and returning to her argument; “then there would be nothing uncomfortable.
And you _said_ you would never be married again.” “It is quite true that I might be a wiser person, Celia,” said Dorothea, “and that I might have done something better, if I had been better.
I have promised to marry Mr. Ladislaw; and I am going to marry him.” The tone in which Dorothea said this was a note that Celia had long learned to recognize.
My heart riseth against him, said Mr.
“Le cœur se sature d’amour comme d’un sel divin qui le conserve; de là l’incorruptible adhérence de ceux qui se sont aimés dès l’aube de la vie, et la fraîcheur des vielles amours prolongées.
Il existe un embaumement d’amour.
Seeing her father, Mary left the swing and went to meet him, pushing back the pink kerchief and smiling afar off at him with the involuntary smile of loving pleasure.
“It will be a sad while before you can be married, Mary,” said her father, not looking at her, but at the end of the stick which he held in his other hand.
I don’t love him because he is a fine match.” “What for, then?” “Oh, dear, because I have always loved him.
And then, if you and Fred get married,” here Caleb’s voice shook just perceptibly, “he’ll be steady and saving; and you’ve got your mother’s cleverness, and mine too, in a woman’s sort of way; and you’ll keep him in order.
If we can’t be married in two years, the truth will be quite bad enough when it comes.” “I have heard a story of a young gentleman who once encouraged flattering expectations, and they did him harm.” “Mary, if you’ve got something discouraging to tell me, I shall bolt; I shall go into the house to Mr. Garth.
“Oh, I could be a tremendously good fellow then, Mary, and we could be married directly.” “Not so fast, sir; how do you know that I would not rather defer our marriage for some years?
“Tell me seriously that all this is true, and that you are happy because of it—because you love me best.” “It is all true, Fred, and I am happy because of it—because I love you best,” said Mary, in a tone of obedient recitation.
Some years after his marriage he told Mary that his happiness was half owing to Farebrother, who gave him a strong pull-up at the right moment.
He kept his love of horsemanship, but he rarely allowed himself a day’s hunting; and when he did so, it was remarkable that he submitted to be laughed at for cowardliness at the fences, seeming to see Mary and the boys sitting on the five-barred gate, or showing their curly heads between hedge and ditch.
But he died prematurely of diphtheria, and Rosamond afterwards married an elderly and wealthy physician, who took kindly to her four children.
Still, she never repented that she had given up position and fortune to marry Will Ladislaw, and he would have held it the greatest shame as well as sorrow to him if she had repented.
They were bound to each other by a love stronger than any impulses which could have marred it.
But no one stated exactly what else that was in her power she ought rather to have done—not even Sir James Chettam, who went no further than the negative prescription that she ought not to have married Will Ladislaw.
During the months of this correspondence Mr. Brooke had continually, in his talk with Sir James Chettam, been presupposing or hinting that the intention of cutting off the entail was still maintained; and the day on which his pen gave the daring invitation, he went to Freshitt expressly to intimate that he had a stronger sense than ever of the reasons for taking that energetic step as a precaution against any mixture of low blood in the heir of the Brookes.
Such being the bent of Celia’s heart, it was inevitable that Sir James should consent to a reconciliation with Dorothea and her husband.
Where women love each other, men learn to smother their mutual dislike.
Sir James never ceased to regard Dorothea’s second marriage as a mistake; and indeed this remained the tradition concerning it in Middlemarch, where she was spoken of to a younger generation as a fine girl who married a sickly clergyman, old enough to be her father, and in little more than a year after his death gave up her estate to marry his cousin—young enough to have been his son, with no property, and not well-born.
Those who had not seen anything of Dorothea usually observed that she could not have been “a nice woman,” else she would not have married either the one or the other.

Even in the midst of the civil turmoil, he fell in love with, and married, a beautiful and amiable young lady of the noble house of Stanley; and from that time had the more merit in his loyalty, as it divorced him from her society, unless at very brief intervals, when his duty permitted an occasional visit to his home.
A sort of companionship, if not intimacy, took place betwixt them, which continued during their youthful sports--the rather that Bridgenorth, though he did not at heart admit Sir Geoffrey&#39;s claims of superiority to the extent which the other&#39;s vanity would have exacted, paid deference in a reasonable degree to the representative of a family so much more ancient and important than his own, without conceiving that he in any respect degraded himself by doing so.
Mr. Bridgenorth did not, however, carry his complaisance so far as to embrace Sir Geoffrey&#39;s side during the Civil War.
Betwixt the breaking out of the Civil War and the Restoration, he lost successively a family of no less than six children, apparently through a delicacy of constitution, which cut off the little prattlers at the early age when they most wind themselves round the heart of the parents.
In the beginning of the year 1658, Major Bridgenorth was childless; ere it ended, he had a daughter, indeed, but her birth was purchased by the death of an affectionate wife, whose constitution had been exhausted by maternal grief, and by the anxious and harrowing reflection, that from her the children they had lost derived that delicacy of health, which proved unable to undergo the tear and wear of existence.
(the Knight would never acknowledge his neighbour&#39;s military rank of Major); &quot;I just looked in to bid you keep a good heart, man, and to tell you that Julian is well, and little Alice is well, and all are well at Martindale Castle.&quot;
The moment when a lover passes the window of his mistress--the moment when the epicure hears the dinner-bell,--is that into which is crowded the whole interest of the day; the hours which precede it are spent in anticipation; the hours which follow, in reflection on what has passed; and fancy dwelling on each brief circumstance, gives to seconds the duration of minutes, to minutes that of hours.
In truth, though a strong-minded man in most respects, he was unable to lay aside the gloomy impression that this remaining pledge of affection was soon to be conveyed to that grave which had already devoured all besides that was dear to him; and he awaited in miserable suspense the moment when he should hear that symptoms of the fatal malady had begun to show themselves.
After thundering forth this elegant effusion of loyal enthusiasm, the sturdy Cavalier&#39;s heart became too full.
&quot;You will--you will find them all well,&quot; said the Baronet; &quot;Julian, Alice, Lady Peveril, and all of them--Bear my commendations to them, and kiss them all, neighbour, Lady Peveril and all--you may kiss a Countess when I come back; all will go well with you now you are turned honest man.&quot;
&quot;I shall see,&quot; he said, &quot;these signs of mortality once more--I shall once more see a beloved being to whom I have given birth, gliding to the grave which ought to enclose me long before her.
He caught her in his arms, pressed her to his heart, and the child, though at first alarmed at the vehemence of his caresses, presently, as if prompted by Nature, smiled in reply to them.
This was a proposal which went to the heart of Major Bridgenorth.
I trust, Master Bridgenorth, the joyful Restoration of his Majesty, a work wrought by the direct hand of Providence, may be the means of closing and healing all civil and religious dissensions among us, and that, instead of showing the superior purity of our faith, by persecuting those who think otherwise from ourselves on doctrinal points, we shall endeavour to show its real Christian tendency, by emulating each other in actions of good-will towards man, as the best way of showing our love to God.&quot;
&quot;Your ladyship speaks what your own kind heart dictates,&quot; answered Bridgenorth, who had his own share of the narrow-mindedness of the time; &quot;and sure am I, that if all who call themselves loyalists and Cavaliers, thought like you--and like my friend Sir Geoffrey&quot;--(this he added after a moment&#39;s pause, being perhaps rather complimentary than sincere)--&quot;we, who thought it our duty in time past to take arms for freedom of conscience, and against arbitrary power, might now sit down in peace and contentment.
&quot;But I crave your pardon--it is so long since we have met, that I forgot you love no play-books.&quot;
David, the man after God&#39;s own heart, did wash and eat bread when his beloved child was removed--mine is restored to me, and shall I not show gratitude under a blessing, when he showed resignation under an affliction?
Having spoken these words with an aspect which belonged more to a martyr than to a guest bidden to a festival, and having kissed, and solemnly blessed his little girl, Major Bridgenorth took his departure for Moultrassie Hall.
Even upon ordinary occasions, and where means were ample, a great entertainment in those days was not such a sinecure as in modern times, when the lady who presides has but to intimate to her menials the day and hour when she wills it to take place.
The lady was silent, for she well knew speech availed nothing; and, after a moment&#39;s pause, proceeded to intimate to the steward that she would have the persons, whose names were marked in a written paper, which she delivered to him, invited to the approaching banquet.
He disliked extremely that Major Bridgenorth, indisputably the head of the Presbyterian interest in that neighbourhood, should have given his only daughter to be, as he termed it, nursed by a Canaanitish woman; and he told him plainly that he liked not this going to feast in the high places with the uncircumcised in heart, and looked on the whole conviviality only as a making-merry in the house of Tirzah.
Upon receiving this rebuke from his pastor, Bridgenorth began to suspect he might have been partly wrong in the readiness which, in his first ardour of gratitude, he had shown to enter into intimate intercourse with the Castle of Martindale; but he was too proud to avow this to the preacher, and it was not till after a considerable debate betwixt them, that it was mutually agreed their presence at the entertainment should depend upon the condition, that no healths or pledges should be given in their presence.
When the King&#39;s party began to lose ground, Doctor Dummerar left his vicarage, and, betaking himself to the camp, showed upon several occasions, when acting as chaplain to Sir Geoffrey Peveril&#39;s regiment, that his portly bodily presence included a stout and masculine heart.
The dark colour of their cloaks, varying from absolute black to what was called sad-coloured--their steeple-crowned hats, with their broad shadowy brims--their long swords, suspended by a simple strap around the loins, without shoulder-belt, sword-knot, plate, buckles, or any of the other decorations with which the Cavaliers loved to adorn their trusty rapiers,--the shortness of their hair, which made their ears appear of disproportioned size,--above all, the stern and gloomy gravity of their looks, announced their belonging to that class of enthusiasts, who, resolute and undismayed, had cast down the former fabric of government, and who now regarded with somewhat more than suspicion, that which had been so unexpectedly substituted in its stead.
If the Puritan was affectedly plain in his dress, and ridiculously precise in his manners, the Cavalier often carried his love of ornament into tawdry finery, and his contempt of hypocrisy into licentious profligacy.
The strictness of his cast and manners permitted him not to sink on his knee, and kiss the hand which held his little orphan; but the deepness of his obeisance--the faltering tremor of his voice--and the glistening of his eye, showed a grateful respect for the lady whom he addressed, deeper and more reverential than could have been expressed even by Persian prostration.
She kissed the Lady Peveril&#39;s forehead, and passed her hand in a caressing manner over her face as she said-- &quot;You too are changed, my fair cousin, but it is a change becomes you, from a pretty and timid maiden to a sage and comely matron.
said Lady Peveril; &quot;or why should you have kept secret a visit which would, if made, have augmented tenfold the happiness of every true heart that rejoiced here yesterday?&quot;
Nay, never blush for the thought of it--it was an honest affection--and though it was the music of trumpets that accompanied you both to the old chapel, which was almost entirely ruined by the enemy&#39;s bullets; and though Prince Rupert, when he gave you away at the altar, was clad in buff and bandoleer, with pistols in his belt, yet I trust these warlike signs were no type of future discord?&quot;
&quot;Heaven has been kind to me,&quot; said the Lady Peveril, &quot;in blessing me with an affectionate husband.&quot;
I obeyed, although I never loved the man.
The Court was held in the open air, before the Dempster and the Keys of the island, assembled under the vaulted cope of heaven, and seated on the terrace of the Zonwald Hill, where of old Druid and Scald held their courts of judgment.
&quot;Hold your saucy tongue, Whitaker,&quot; said the Lady Peveril; &quot;and do you, Master Bridgenorth, not take it to heart that you are detained prisoner for a few hours, until the Countess of Derby can have nothing to fear from your pursuit.
&quot;Real valour consists not in being insensible to danger, but in being prompt to confront and disarm it;--and we may have present occasion for all that we possess,&quot; she added, with some slight emotion, &quot;for I hear the trampling of horses&#39; steps on the pavement of the court.&quot;
He burst into the room; his manly countenance and disordered dress showing marks that he had been riding fast; and without looking to any one else, caught his good lady in his arms, and kissed her a dozen of times.--Blushing, and with some difficulty, Lady Peveril extricated herself from Sir Geoffrey&#39;s arms; and in a voice of bashful and gentle rebuke, bid him, for shame, observe who was in the room.
said Sir Geoffrey, doffing his plumed hat with an air of deep deference, and kissing with much reverence the hand which she held out to him; &quot;I am as glad to see your ladyship in my poor house, as I would be to hear that they had found a vein of lead in the Brown Tor.
The father kissed the boy heartily; and the Countess, calling him to her so soon as Sir Geoffrey had set him down, kissed his forehead also, and then surveyed all his features with a keen and penetrating eye.
&quot;Marry, and I thank you for the proposal with all my heart, madam,&quot; said the Knight.
Do not be so foolish, my love--what I ask is better than you can desire for your boy; for the house of my father, the Duke de la Tremouille, was the most famous school of chivalry in France; nor have I degenerated from him, or suffered any relaxation in that noble discipline which trained young gentlemen to do honour to their race.
You pay too high deference to our masters, the male sex, if you allow Julian to engross all your affection, and spare none for this beautiful girl.&quot;
So saying, she set down Julian, and, taking Alice Bridgenorth on her lap, began to caress her; and there was, notwithstanding her masculine character, something so sweet in the tone of her voice and in the cast of her features, that the child immediately smiled, and replied to her marks of fondness.
&quot;Bridgenorth cares not for these amorous toys, and thou thinkest of nothing else.
She hath a right to follow her fancy, as the dame said who kissed her cow--only I do not much approve her choice, that is all.
&quot;I tell you once more,&quot; said Whitaker, &quot;you are mistaken; and that there neither is, nor can be, any matter of love between them, but only some intrigue, concerning, perhaps, this same noble Countess of Derby.
The Countess of Derby, after an affectionate adieu to Sir Geoffrey, and having requested him to convey her kind commendations to her little page-elect and his mother, proceeded up the pass at a round pace, and with her attendants and escort, was soon out of sight.
She comforted herself with the recollection, however, that she had still a strong hold on Bridgenorth, through his paternal affection, and from the fixed opinion which he had hitherto manifested, that his daughter&#39;s health could only flourish while under her charge.
Lady Peveril, who readily adopted the more good-natured construction of the governante&#39;s motives, could not help laughing at the idea of a man of Bridgenorth&#39;s precise appearance, strict principles, and reserved habits, being suspected of a design of gallantry; and readily concluded, that Mistress Deborah had found her advantage in gratifying his parental affection by a frequent sight of his daughter during the few days which intervened betwixt his first seeing little Alice at the Castle, and the events which had followed.
For who would abide in the Sanctuary, after the carved work thereof is broken down, and when it hath been made a place for owls, and satyrs of the wilderness?--And herein I blame myself, madam, that I went in the singleness of my heart too readily into that carousing in the house of feasting, wherein my love of union, and my desire to show respect to your ladyship, were made a snare to me.
But I trust it will be an atonement, that I am now about to absent myself from the place of my birth, and the house of my fathers, as well as from the place which holdeth the dust of those pledges of my affection.
&quot;I suppose, madam,&quot; said the waiting-woman, &quot;the fanatic fool intends to marry the wench?
&quot;My letter says nothing of marriage; but it would appear that Master Bridgenorth, being to leave this country, has engaged Deborah to take care of his child; and I am sure I am heartily glad of it, for the infant&#39;s sake.&quot;
&quot;And I am glad of it for my own,&quot; said Ellesmere; &quot;and, indeed, for the sake of the whole house.--And your ladyship thinks she is not like to be married to him?
&quot;I spoiled a good one, Ellesmere, when I spoiled thee,&quot; said the lady; &quot;but tell Mistress Deborah to kiss the little Alice for me, and to offer my good wishes to Major Bridgenorth, for his temporal and future happiness.&quot;
But, notwithstanding these ireful resolutions, resentment altogether subsided in the honest Knight&#39;s breast, when he saw the fair features of his lady lightened with affectionate joy at his return in safety.
As he took her in his arms and kissed her, he forgave her ere he mentioned her offence.
&quot;It is the true end of a dissenter,&quot; he said, &quot;to marry his own maid-servant, or some other person&#39;s.
&quot;Nay, nay,&quot; said the Lady Peveril, &quot;you are as uncharitable as Ellesmere--I believe it but to be affection to his child.&quot;
answered the Knight, &quot;women are eternally thinking of children; but among men, dame, many one carresses the infant that he may kiss the child&#39;s maid; and where&#39;s the wonder or the harm either, if Bridgenorth should marry the wench?
But let us hear what he says for himself--I shall spell it out if there is any roguery in the letter about love and liking, though it might escape your innocence, Dame Margaret.&quot;
Lady Peveril had, from her sincere affection and sound sense, as good a right to claim the full confidence of her husband, as any woman in Derbyshire; and, upon this occasion, to confess the truth, she had more anxiety to know his purpose than her sense of their mutual and separate duties permitted her in general to entertain.
As the good Knight spoke these words, a post winded his horn in the court, and a large packet was brought in, addressed to the worshipful Sir Geoffrey Peveril, Justice of the Peace, and so forth; for he had been placed in authority as soon as the King&#39;s Restoration was put upon a settled basis.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>But I, that have so often carried the banner forth against the mighty--I, whose tongue hath testified, morning and evening, like the watchman upon the tower, against Popery, Prelacy, and the tyrant of the Peak--for me to abide here, were but to bring the sword of bloody vengeance amongst you, that the shepherd might be smitten, and the sheep scattered.
&quot;Master Bridgenorth,--We have been given to understand by your letter to our loving wife, Dame Margaret Peveril, that you hold hard construction of certain passages betwixt you and I, of a late date, as if your honour should have been, in some sort, prejudiced by what then took place.
For some time public rumour persisted in asserting, that Major Bridgenorth had only retreated to a distant part of the country for a season, to achieve his supposed purpose of marrying Mrs. Deborah, and of letting the news be cold, and the laugh of the neighbourhood be ended, ere he brought her down as mistress of Moultrassie Hall.
The most prevailing opinion was, that they had gone to New England, the refuge then of many whom too intimate concern with the affairs of the late times, or the desire of enjoying uncontrolled freedom of conscience, had induced to emigrate from Britain.
She thought of her blighted hopes--her premature death--the despair of her self-banished husband--the uncertain fate of their orphan child, for whom she felt, even at this distance of time, some touch of a mother&#39;s affection.
&quot;I have indeed been changed--ay, my very heart within me hath been changed.
Heaven saw need to chastise me in love--I was stript of all I clung to on earth--my worldly honour was torn from me--I went forth an exile from the home of my fathers, a deprived and desolate man--a baffled, and beaten, and dishonoured man.
I had ridden from London, and brought with me a protection from the committee for your husband; and as I passed the spot--here on this spot where we now stand, you stood with my lost Alice--two--the last two of my beloved infants gambolled before you.
But does not every Christian creed teach us alike, that affliction should soften our heart?&quot;
No; the seared wood is the fitter for the use of the workmen--the hardened and the dried-up heart is that which can best bear the task imposed by these dismal times.
But having been for some time of age, he did not think it absolutely necessary to obey her in this particular; and had remained for some time in London, partaking the pleasures of the gay Court there, with all the ardour of a young man bred up in comparative seclusion.
I shall not interfere, unless she hold a high court of justice again.
to pull a dead strain on a miserable gudgeon, which you draw ashore by main force, as the fellows here tow in their fishing-boats--or a lively salmon, that makes your rod crack, and your line whistle--plays you ten thousand mischievous pranks--wearies your heart out with hopes and fears--and is only laid panting on the bank, after you have shown the most unmatchable display of skill, patience, and dexterity?--But I see you have a mind to go on angling after your own old fashion.
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Dame Deborah; &quot;but I did not bid you fall in love with us, though, or propose such a matter as marriage either to Alice or myself.&quot;
&quot;I may indeed have said your estates were born to be united; and to be sure it is natural for me, that come of the old stock of the yeomanry of Peveril of the Peak&#39;s estate, to wish that it was all within the ring fence again; which sure enough it might be, were you to marry Alice Bridgenorth.
No flatterer like a lover, who wishes to carry his point.
your foster-son, whom you loved so well, and took such care of?&quot;
Hers was a soul of a kind often to be met with, both among the lower and higher vulgar, who, without being, on a broad scale, accessible to bribes or corruption, are nevertheless much attached to perquisites, and considerably biassed in their line of duty, though perhaps insensibly, by the love of petty observances, petty presents, and trivial compliments.
So saying, he covered his face with one hand, and extended the other, in the act of bidding adieu to Dame Debbitch, whose kind heart became unable to withstand the sight of his affliction.
for aught that ever I could read, Could ever hear by tale or history, The course of true love never did run smooth!
The period at which love is formed for the first time, and felt most strongly, is seldom that at which there is much prospect of its being brought to a happy issue.
In fine, there are few men who do not look back in secret to some period of their youth, at which a sincere and early affection was repulsed, or betrayed, or become abortive from opposing circumstances.
It is these little passages of secret history, which leave a tinge of romance in every bosom, scarce permitting us, even in the most busy or the most advanced period of life, to listen with total indifference to a tale of true love.
When the dance was over, he folded her in his arms, smoothed her somewhat disordered locks with a father&#39;s affectionate hand, smiled, kissed her brow, and took his leave, without one single word farther interdicting the exercise of dancing.
The visits of the young angler became more and more frequent; and the embarrassed Deborah, though foreseeing all the dangers of discovery, and the additional risk of an explanation betwixt Alice and Julian, which must necessarily render their relative situation so much more delicate, felt completely overborne by the enthusiasm of the young lover, and was compelled to let matters take their course.
But when he next indulged himself with spending an hour in the place where he would gladly have abode for ever, the altered manner of Alice--the tone in which she seemed to upbraid his neglect, penetrated his heart, and deprived him of that power of self-command, which he had hitherto exercised in their interviews.
But, when Julian concluded his tale with the warmest protestations of eternal love, &quot;My poor father!&quot;
&quot;That I hold this language--that the son of Peveril addresses thus the daughter of your father--that he thus kneels to you for forgiveness of injuries which passed when we were both infants, shows the will of Heaven, that in our affection should be quenched the discord of our parents.
Alice, however new such a scene, and, above all, her own emotions, might be, was highly endowed with that exquisite delicacy which is imprinted in the female heart, to give warning of the slightest approach to impropriety in a situation like hers.
The commanding tone of Alice overawed the impetuosity of her lover, who took in silence a seat removed to some distance from hers, and was again about to speak.
said her lover.
&quot;Fire can soften iron--thy father&#39;s heart cannot be so hard, or his prejudices so strong, but I shall find some means to melt him.
They desire that I should marry--in their last letters they pressed it more openly--they shall have their desire; and such a bride as I will present to them has not graced their house since the Conqueror gave it origin.
There lacked not opportunities of entering upon the subject; for in the first ride which he took with his father, the Knight resumed the subject of his son&#39;s marriage, and liberally left the lady to his choice; but under the strict proviso, that she was of a loyal and an honourable family;--if she had fortune, it was good and well, or rather, it was better than well; but if she was poor, why, &quot;there is still some picking,&quot; said Sir Geoffrey, &quot;on the bones of the old estate; and Dame Margaret and I will be content with the less, that you young folks may have your share of it.
said Julian, affecting indifference, while his heart was trembling, as it seemed to him, almost in his very throat.
But the courage of a youthful lover is not easily subdued; and Julian, after having gone through the usual round of trying to forget his ungrateful mistress, and entertaining his passion with augmented violence, ended by the visit to the Black Fort, the beginning of which we narrated in the last chapter.
When Alice Bridgenorth at length entered the parlour where her anxious lover had so long expected her, it was with a slow step, and a composed manner.
Her dress was arranged with an accurate attention to form, which at once enhanced the appearance of its puritanic simplicity, and struck Julian as a bad omen; for although the time bestowed upon the toilet may, in many cases, intimate the wish to appear advantageously at such an interview, yet a ceremonious arrangement of attire is very much allied with formality, and a preconceived determination to treat a lover with cold politeness.
His heart beat high as she came into the apartment, and it was almost without an attempt to speak that his profound obeisance acknowledged her entrance.
The tremulous accent fell especially on the last word she uttered, and it was spoken in a low tone of gentle reproach, which went to Julian&#39;s heart.
answered Julian; &quot;and if all other obstacles were removed, I should find one in the cold flinty bosom of her who repays the most devoted and sincere affection with contempt and dislike?--Is that,&quot; he added, in a deep tone of feeling--&quot;is that what Alice Bridgenorth says to Julian Peveril?&quot;
to own affection for one from whom fate has separated me for ever?
You are attached to my daughter by the cords of love; I have long known this.&quot;
Young man, they say that such love as you entertain for my daughter teaches much subtilty; but believe not that it can overreach the affection which a widowed father bears to an only child.&quot;
&quot;If,&quot; said Julian, his heart beating thick and joyfully, &quot;if you have known this intercourse so long, may I not hope that it has not met your disapprobation?&quot;
They loved you once; I trust they will love you again.
Accordingly, in a few minutes, the latter proceeded.--&quot;These things,&quot; he said, &quot;I recall not in bitterness, so far as they are personal to me--I recall them not in spite of heart, though they have been the means of banishing me from my place of residence, where my fathers dwelt, and where my earthly comforts lie interred.
But notwithstanding the ardour with which the young man had pressed his suit, he was too much trained in ideas of the importance of his family, and in the better habit of respect for his parents, to hear, without displeasure, some part of Bridgenorth&#39;s discourse.
So saying, he stretched out his thin, bony hand, and grasped that of Julian Peveril; but there was such a look of mourning in his welcome, that whatever delight the youth anticipated, spending so long a time in the neighbourhood of Alice Bridgenorth, perhaps in her society, or however strongly he felt the prudence of conciliating her father&#39;s good-will, he could not help feeling as if his heart was chilled in his company.
Hear if I ever asked another youngster into the house, save himself--for I knew your honour was wise, and quarrels cannot last for ever, and love begins where hatred ends; and, to be sure, they love as if they were born one for the other--and then, the estates of Moultrassie and Martindale suit each other like sheath and knife.&quot;
&quot;That I will, and with all my heart,&quot; said Deborah; &quot;and if there are a pair of fatter fowls in Man than shall clap their wings on the table presently, your honour shall call me goose as well as parrot.&quot;
This discourse made the time fly light away; for although the anecdotes and observations thus communicated were all tinged with the serious and almost gloomy spirit of the narrator, they yet contained traits of interest and of wonder, such as are usually interesting to a youthful ear, and were particularly so to Julian, who had, in his disposition, some cast of the romantic and adventurous.
Presently, with the feeling of one who walks in a pleasant dream from which he fears to awake, and whose delight is mingled with wonder and with uncertainty, Julian Peveril found himself seated between Alice Bridgenorth and her father--the being he most loved on earth, and the person whom he had ever considered as the great obstacle to their intercourse.
For example, when Deborah, in the pride and vulgarity of her heart, called Julian&#39;s attention to the plate from which they had been eating, Bridgenorth seemed to think an apology necessary for such superfluous expense.
I have heard many an act of devotion in my life, had Heaven vouchsafed me grace to profit by them; but such a prayer as this, uttered amid the dead and the dying, with a rich tone of mingled triumph and adoration, was beyond them all--it was like the song of the inspired prophetess who dwelt beneath the palm-tree between Ramah and Bethel.
The patriarch bought his beloved by fourteen years&#39; hard service to her father Laban, and they seemed to him but as a few days.
Upon this unfortunate being, with the touch of romance which marked many of her proceedings, Lady Derby had conferred the name of Fenella, after some ancient princess of the island.
The young men rose to receive her with the formal reverence which they knew she loved, and were greeted by her with equal kindness.
&quot;I wish, then, Philip, you would exert it to better purpose,&quot; said the Countess, half smiling, half displeased; for she doated upon her son with all a mother&#39;s fondness, even when she was most angry with him for being deficient in the peculiar and chivalrous disposition which had distinguished his father, and which was so analogous to her own romantic and high-minded character.
&quot;My signet you shall command with all my heart, madam,&quot; said Earl Philip; &quot;but spare me the revision of what you are much more capable to decide upon.
&quot;Do not think better of me than I deserve,&quot; said the Earl to Peveril; &quot;my mother has omitted to tell you the culprit was pretty Peggy of Ramsey, and her crime what in Cupid&#39;s courts would have been called a peccadillo.&quot;
the last pledge which he sent, with his love to me, and his blessing to thee, the night before they murdered him at Bolton!&quot;
&quot;Mother, dearest mother,&quot; said the Earl, startled out of his apathy, and taking her hand, which he kissed tenderly, &quot;I did but jest--the signet is safe--Peveril knows that it is so.--Go fetch it, Julian, for Heaven&#39;s sake--here are my keys--it is in the left-hand drawer of my travelling cabinet--Nay, mother, forgive me--it was but a _mauvaise plaisanterie_; only an ill-imagined jest, ungracious, and in bad taste, I allow--but only one of Philip&#39;s follies.
But believe me, though to be an absolute Palmerin of England is not in my nature, no son ever loved a mother more dearly, or would do more to oblige her.
A mother is easily appeased, even when most offended; and it was with an expanding heart that the Countess saw her son&#39;s very handsome features, while reading these papers, settle into an expression of deep seriousness, such as they seldom wore.
The King, who has sworn never to kiss the pillow his father went to sleep on, temporises, and gives way to the current; the Duke of York, suspected and hated on account of his religion, is about to be driven to the continent; several principal Catholic nobles are in the Tower already; and the nation, like a bull at Tutbury-running, is persecuted with so many inflammatory rumours and pestilent pamphlets, that she has cocked her tail, flung up her heels, taken the bit betwixt her teeth and is as furiously unmanageable as in the year 1642.&quot;
&quot;My good mother,&quot; said the Earl, &quot;loves power, though it has cost her dear.
&quot;Why,&quot; replied the Earl, &quot;I believe in her heart she is something ashamed of that gallant act of royalty and supreme jurisdiction, the consequences of which maimed my estate so cruelly.--Well, cousin, this same Edward Christian was one of the dempsters at the time, and, naturally enough, was unwilling to concur in the sentence which adjudged his _aine_ to be shot like a dog.
No doubt, she would soon have had them in the Castle court, with a dozen of the old matchlocks levelled against them--that is her way of solving all sudden difficulties.&quot;
&quot;Go where love calls you--I will make an excuse to my mother--only, most grave anchorite, be hereafter more indulgent to the failings of others than you have been hitherto, and blaspheme not the power of the little deity.&quot;
Come, be frank--tell me name and place--or say but the colour of the eyes of the most emphatic she--or do but let me have the pleasure to hear thee say, &#39;I love!&#39;
Such, in form and habits, was the little female, who, holding in her hand a small old-fashioned ebony rod, which might have passed for a divining wand, confronted Julian on the top of the flight of steps which led down the rock from the Castle court.
Julian, in reply, extended his arm more than half, to intimate that the distance was considerable.
Peveril smiled, and nodded, to intimate there was no danger in quitting her mistress for a short space.
Julian Peveril was far from being void of sympathy towards the poor girl, whose motives in opposing his departure appeared to be her affectionate apprehension for her mistress&#39;s safety.
He endeavoured to reassure by smiles, and, at the same time, by such signs as he could devise, to intimate that there was no danger, and that he would return presently; and having succeeded in extricating his cloak from her grasp, and in passing her on the stair, he began to descend the steps as speedily as he could, in order to avoid farther importunity.
And could he succeed in this point, he should at once, he thought, render a material benefit to the father of his beloved Alice--remove the Earl from his state of anxiety--save the Countess from a second time putting her feudal jurisdiction in opposition to that of the Crown of England--and secure quiet possession of the island to her and her family.
See the maiden mourns, And the sad suitor bends his looks on earth.
That Alice should extend her hand to her lover, as with the ardour of a young greyhound he bounded over the obstacles of the rugged path, was as natural as that Julian, seizing on the hand so kindly stretched out, should devour it with kisses, and, for a moment or two, without reprehension; while the other hand, which should have aided in the liberation of its fellow, served to hide the blushes of the fair owner.
Julian Peveril&#39;s mind had been early illuminated with that touch of romantic fire which deprives passion of selfishness, and confers on it the high and refined tone of generous and disinterested devotion.
He let go the hand of Alice with as much respect as he could have paid to that of a princess; and when she seated herself upon a rocky fragment, over which nature had stretched a cushion of moss and lichen, interspersed with wild flowers, backed with a bush of copsewood, he took his place beside her, indeed, but at such distance as to intimate the duty of an attendant, who was there only to hear and to obey.
Alice Bridgenorth became more assured as she observed the power which she possessed over her lover; and the self-command which Peveril exhibited, which other damsels in her situation might have judged inconsistent with intensity of passion, she appreciated more justly, as a proof of his respectful and disinterested sincerity.
She recovered, in addressing him, the tone of confidence which rather belonged to the scenes of their early acquaintance, than to those which had passed betwixt them since Peveril had disclosed his affection, and thereby had brought restraint upon their intercourse.
&quot;Ah, Alice, with a cold and doubtful phrase you have used to express the most devoted, the most sincere affection!&quot;
Can you bid me do all this, and, in the same breath, bid farewell for ever to you and happiness?--It is impossible--I cannot surrender at once my love and my honour.&quot;
&quot;Fear not for my parents, Alice,&quot; replied Julian, and pressing close to his companion&#39;s side, he ventured to throw his arm around her; &quot;they love me, and they will soon learn to love, in Alice, the only being on earth who could have rendered their son happy.
But while he spoke, in joyful anticipation of the consent which he implored, Alice found means to collect together her resolution, which, staggered by the eagerness of her lover, the impulse of her own affections, and the singularity of her situation,--seeming, in her case, to justify what would have been most blamable in another,--had more than half abandoned her.
She extricated herself from the arm which had pressed her to his side--arose, and repelling his attempts to approach or detain her, said, with a simplicity not unmingled with dignity, &quot;Julian, I always knew I risked much in inviting you to this meeting; but I did not guess that I could have been so cruel to both to you and to myself, as to suffer you to discover what you have to-day seen too plainly--that I love you better than you love me.
But since you do know it, I will show you that Alice&#39;s love is disinterested--She will not bring an ignoble name into your ancient house.
said her lover.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>How many from the culpable suggestions of ambition, self-seeking, and love of plunder?
&quot;And you,&quot; continued Major Bridgenorth, turning from his daughter to her lover,--&quot;you sir, have well repaid the liberal confidence which I placed in you with so little reserve.
&quot;You, sir, wandered hither from Holm-Peel--my daughter strolled forth from the Black Fort; and chance, doubtless, assigned you a meeting by the stone of Goddard Crovan?--Young man, disgrace yourself by no more apologies--they are worse than useless.--And you, maiden, who, in your fear of losing your lover, could verge on betraying what might have cost a father his life--begone to your home.
&quot;A true specimen of womankind,&quot; said her father, looking after her, &quot;who would give the cause of nations up, rather than endanger a hair of her lover&#39;s head.--You, Master Peveril, doubtless, hold her opinion, that the best love is a safe love!&quot;
The turns of human nature, and of human passion, are so irregular and uncertain, that although Julian had but a few minutes before urged to Alice a private marriage, and an elopement to the continent, as a measure upon which the whole happiness of his life depended, the proposal seemed not to him half so delightful when stated by the calm, cold, dictatorial accents of her father.
He was mute for a moment, in the vain attempt to shape his answer so as at once to intimate acquiescence in what Bridgenorth stated, and a vindication of his own regard for his parents, and for the honour of his house.
I had not now held conference with you in this intimate fashion, were I not aware that you, Master Julian, were free from such stain of the times.
&quot;What I have said,&quot; replied Julian Peveril, &quot;being the unbiassed sentiments of my heart, shall, upon no proper occasion, want the support of my open avowal; and I think it strange you should doubt me so far.&quot;
&quot;Not in anger, my son,&quot; said Bridgenorth, &quot;but in love and strong affection.
I accept not thy suit, neither do I reject it; only this I intimate to you, that he who would be my son, must first show himself the true and loving child of his oppressed and deluded country.
&quot;You need not fear, Alice,&quot; he said in his heart; &quot;not even your hand would I purchase by aught which resembled unworthy or truckling compliance with tenets which my heart disowns; and well I know, were I mean enough to do so, even the authority of thy father were insufficient to compel thee to the ratification of so mean a bargain.
&quot;Thrice welcome, Sir Knight of Dames,&quot; said the Earl; &quot;here you rove gallantly, and at free will, through our dominions, fulfilling of appointments, and achieving amorous adventures; while we are condemned to sit in our royal halls, as dull and as immovable as if our Majesty was carved on the stern of some Manx smuggling dogger, and christened the King Arthur of Ramsey.&quot;
To Julian&#39;s inquiry, she answered, by laying her hand on her heart--a motion by which she always indicated the Countess--and rising, and taking the direction of her apartment, she made a sign to Julian to follow her.
He has kindness of heart and vivacity of talent; and yet----&quot; &quot;Dearest lady,&quot; said Peveril, &quot;why will you distress yourself with fixing your eye on deficiencies which arise rather from a change of times and manners, than any degeneracy of my noble friend?
It is hard to expect that mere compassion for a persecuted sect--or, what is yet more rare, an abstract love of justice--should be powerful enough to engage men to expose themselves to the awakened fury of a whole people; for, in the present state of general agitation, whoever disbelieves the least tittle of the enormous improbabilities which have been accumulated by these wretched reformers, is instantly hunted down, as one who would smother the discovery of the Plot.
The Countess listened with a countenance in which the anxiety of maternal affection, which prompted her to embrace Peveril&#39;s generous offer, struggled with her native disinterested and generous disposition.
Selfish as I am, I cannot but reflect that my kinswoman has, in all events, the support of an affectionate husband--such is the interested reasoning to which we are not ashamed to subject our better feelings.&quot;
I could not love you so much, but for the openness and candour of your nature; and I would not that you concealed from Major Bridgenorth one syllable of what I now avow.
CHAPTER XIX Now, hoist the anchor, mates--and let the sails Give their broad bosom to the buxom wind, Like lass that woos a lover.
&quot;A good horse, Julian,&quot; continued the Countess, &quot;and a good sword, next to a good heart and head, are the accomplishments of a cavalier.&quot;
&quot;I kiss your hands, then, madam,&quot; said Peveril, &quot;and humbly beg you to believe, that whatever may fail in my present undertaking, my purpose to serve you, my noble kinswoman and benefactress, can at least never swerve or falter.&quot;
They took an affectionate leave of each other; the more affectionate, indeed, on the part of the Countess, that she could not entirely reconcile her generous mind to exposing Peveril to danger on her son&#39;s behalf; and Julian betook himself to his solitary apartment.
As the path was by no means a straight one, Peveril could not but admire the intimate acquaintance with the mazes which his singular companion displayed, as well as the boldness with which she traversed them.
To seek his country&#39;s welfare, and secure the blessings of domestic peace--to discharge a bold and perilous duty to his friend and patron--to regard his passion for Alice Bridgenorth, as the loadstar which was to guide him to noble deeds--were the resolutions which thronged upon his mind, and which exalted his spirits to that state of romantic melancholy, which perhaps is ill exchanged even for feelings of joyful rapture.
Julian renewed his expostulation by look and gesture--pointed to his own heart, to intimate the Countess--and bent his brows, to show the displeasure which she must entertain.
The man, with an air of extreme dignity, pulled from his pocket, and thrust into Peveril&#39;s hand, a warrant, subscribed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, empowering Charles Topham, their officer of the Black Rod, to pursue and seize upon the persons of certain individuals named in the warrant; and of all other persons who are, or should be, accused by competent witnesses, of being accessory to, or favourers of, the hellish and damnable Popish Plot, at present carried on within the bowels of the kingdom; and charging all men, as they loved their allegiance, to render the said Charles Topham their readiest and most effective assistance, in execution of the duty entrusted to his care.
&quot;Stick to that, noble captain,&quot; answered the officer; &quot;but, prithee, reserve thy oaths for the court of justice; it is but sheer waste to throw them away, as you do in your ordinary conversation.&quot;
She was a buxom dame about thirty, whose comely and cheerful countenance did honour to the choice of the jolly miller, her loving mate; and was now stationed under the shade of an old-fashioned huge projecting chimney, within which it was her province to &quot;work i&#39; the fire,&quot; and provide for the wearied wayfaring man, the good things which were to send him rejoicing on his course.
&quot;Do not good woman me, sir,&quot; replied the miller&#39;s wife, &quot;till I call you good man; and, I promise you, many would scruple to do that to one who does not love eggs and bacon of a Friday.&quot;
&#39;Alas, my heart&#39;s queen!
Now with his love--now in his cold grave Alone, withouten other company.&#39;
&quot;I thank you for the information with all my heart,&quot; said Peveril; &quot;and to avail myself of it to the uttermost, I must beg you to ride forward, or lag behind, or take a side-path, at your own pleasure; for as I am no Catholic, and travel upon business of high concernment, I am exposed both to risk and delay, and even to danger, by keeping such suspicious company.
But his language did not intimate the least apprehension.
He has two daughters--brighter eyes never beamed under a pinched hood; and for myself, I think there is more fire in those who live only to love and to devotion, than in your court beauties, whose hearts are running on twenty follies besides.
He therefore answered, after a moment&#39;s recollection, &quot;I embrace your proposal, sir; although, by doing so, I am reposing a sudden, and perhaps an unwary, confidence.&quot;
&quot;I love roast-beef as well as ragouts, at any time,&quot; said Peveril, adjusting himself to a task which every young man should know how to perform when need is; &quot;and my horse, though it be but a sorry jade, will champ better on hay and corn, than on an iron bit.&quot;
I love the knack of clean and secret conveyance--thou knowest it was the foundation of my fortunes.&quot;
So, &#39;All joy to great Caesar, Long life, love, and pleasure; May the King live for ever, &#39;Tis no matter for us, boys.&#39;&quot;
His conscience cleared of this gentleman-like scruple, Peveril proceeded with a light heart, though somewhat a dizzy head, to the stable, which he easily recognised among a few other paltry outhouses.
The less favourable construction of unfriendly neighbours of the dissenting persuasion, ascribed the origin and continuance of this practice to the assuming pride of the family of Peveril, who thereby chose to intimate their ancient _suzerainte_ over the whole country, in the manner of the admiral who carries the lantern in the poop, for the guidance of the fleet.
There was bluff old Sir Geoffrey loved brandy and mum well, And to see a beer-glass turned over the thumb well; But he fled like the wind, before Fairfax and Cromwell, Which nobody can deny.&quot;
&quot;Gracious Heaven!--Dear dame, for love or gold, let me have a horse to make for the Castle!&quot;
His heart sunk within him as he turned to the left, through a small outward hall, towards the great parlour, which the family usually occupied as a sitting apartment; and his alarm became still greater, when, on a nearer approach, he heard proceeding from thence the murmur of several voices.
Lady Peveril--the emblem of death, so pallid was her countenance--stood at the distance of a yard or two from her husband, upon whom her eyes were fixed with an intenseness of gaze, like that of one who looks her last on the object which she loves the best.
Your heart is up, I warrant, because you have the King&#39;s pardon; and are replaced on the bench, forsooth, to persecute the poor Papist.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;Master Bridgenorth,&quot; said Lady Peveril, in spite of her husband&#39;s efforts to interrupt her, &quot;for God&#39;s sake, if ever you knew what it was to love one of the many children you have lost, or her who is now left to you, do not pursue your vengeance to the blood of my poor boy!
Think of this; and when you again boast of your ancestry, remember, that he who raiseth the lowly can also abase the high in heart.&quot;
Julian did indeed gaze for an instant, with a swelling heart, upon the dimly seen turrets of his paternal mansion, on which poured the moonlight, mixed with long shadows of the towers and trees.
Julian, who followed his conductor with a throbbing heart into the lighted hall, was therefore prepared to see her whom he best loved, with her arms thrown around her father.
The instant she had quitted his paternal embrace, she was aware of the unexpected guest who had returned in his company.
A deep blush, rapidly succeeded by a deadly paleness, and again by a slighter suffusion, showed plainly to her lover that his sudden appearance was anything but indifferent to her.
Yet when the slight bustle took place which attends the adjusting of chairs, &amp;c., as men sit down to table, Julian&#39;s eye encountered that of the stranger; and as their looks met, there glanced from those of the latter an expression of satirical humour and scorn, which seemed to intimate internal ridicule of the gravity of his present demeanour.
His eyes glanced from Alice to the stranger; and new fears, and undefined suspicions, in which the safety of that beloved and lovely girl was implicated, mingled with the deep anxiety which already occupied his mind, on account of his father and his father&#39;s house.
The lecture finished, Bridgenorth summoned them to unite with him in prayer; and on a slight change of arrangements amongst the company, which took place as they were about to kneel down, Julian found his place next to the single-minded and beautiful object of his affection, as she knelt, in her loveliness, to adore her Creator.
He resisted, however, an impulse which it would have been insanity to have yielded to, and his patience was not without its reward; for when his fair neighbour arose from her knees, the lengthened and prolonged prayer being at last concluded, he observed that her eyes were streaming with tears; and one glance with which she looked at him in that moment, showed more of affectionate interest for him in his fallen fortunes and precarious condition, than he had been able to obtain from her when his worldly estate seemed so much the more exalted of the two.
Alice also passed by her lover, her eyes fixed on the ground, and answered his low obeisance without raising them.
But for thee, Julian Peveril--why should I conceal it from thee?--my heart yearns for thee as a woman&#39;s for her first-born.
&quot;Will it suffice for a proof of my intimate acquaintance with your mystery,&quot; replied Bridgenorth, &quot;if I should repeat to you the last words which the Countess used to you when you left the Castle of that Amalekitish woman?
With a heavy heart, yet with that confidence in an overruling Providence which never forsakes a good and brave man, Peveril betook himself to his lowly place of repose.
Whilst, overcome with fatigue, and worn out by anxiety, Julian Peveril slumbered as a prisoner in the house of his hereditary enemy, Fortune was preparing his release by one of those sudden frolics with which she loves to confound the calculations and expectancies of humanity; and as she fixes on strange agents for such purposes, she condescended to employ on the present occasion, no less a personage than Mistress Deborah Debbitch.
Now Dame Ellesmere and Mistress Deborah had not by any means been formerly on so friendly a footing, as this haste to visit her might be supposed to intimate.
Dame Ellesmere&#39;s eyes were so often dim, that, even with the aid of spectacles, she failed to recognise, in the portly and mature personage who entered their cottage, the tight well-made lass, who, presuming on her good looks and flippant tongue, had so often provoked her by insubordination; and her former lover, the redoubted Lance, not being conscious that ale had given rotundity to his own figure, which was formerly so slight and active, and that brandy had transferred to his nose the colour which had once occupied his cheeks, was unable to discover that Deborah&#39;s French cap, composed of sarsenet and Brussels lace, shaded the features which had so often procured him a rebuke from Dr. Dummerar, for suffering his eyes, during the time of prayers, to wander to the maid-servants&#39; bench.
&quot;I thought we had done with their warrants ever since the blessed twenty-ninth of May,&quot; said the old housekeeper of Martindale Castle; &quot;but this I tell thee, sweetheart, that I have seen such warrants crammed, at the sword&#39;s point, down the throats of them that brought them; and so shall this be, if there is one true man left to drink of the Dove.&quot;
But dang it, if old Sir Geoffrey go to the wall without a knock for it!--Here you, Nell&quot;--(speaking to one of the fugitive maidens from the Castle)--&quot;but, no--you have not the heart of a cat, and are afraid of your own shadow by moonlight--But, Cis, you are a stout-hearted wench, and know a buck from a bullfinch.
Hark thee, Cis, as you would wish to be married, get up to the Castle again, and get thee in--thou best knowest where--for thou hast oft gotten out of postern to a dance or junketing, to my knowledge--Get thee back to the Castle, as ye hope to be married--See my lady--they cannot hinder thee of that--my lady has a head worth twenty of ours--If I am to gather force, light up the beacon for a signal; and spare not a tar barrel on&#39;t.
&quot;Whether they are or not, Master Lance (and you know nothing of the matter), they shall do your errand to-night, for love of the old knight and his lady.&quot;
&quot;Stand up, my mettled wench,&quot; said he, giving her a sly kiss at the same time, &quot;and let us know what is going on up at the Castle.&quot;
&quot;Now, a true solder,&quot; said Lance Outram to himself, &quot;would put a stop to thy snivelling ditty, by making a broad arrow quiver in your heart, and no great alarm given.
I have a score of friends, well armed with musket and pistol, to defend my house; and we have both the means and heart, with Heaven&#39;s assistance, to repay any violence you can offer.&quot;
&quot;Nay,&quot; answered the speaker, who was the same individual that had struck Julian by his resemblance to the man who called himself Ganlesse, &quot;I love a dire revenge, but we shall buy it somewhat too dear if these rascals set the house on fire, as they are like to do, while you are parleying from the window.
The light which she bore in her hand served to show those features which could rarely have been viewed by any one without emotion, but which bore an expression irresistible to a lover.
Julian found it difficult, where so little opening was afforded him, to find a tone in which to open the subjects he had at heart, that should be at once dignified and conciliating.
&quot;Major Bridgenorth,&quot; he said at length, &quot;you have been a son, and an affectionate one--You may conceive my present anxiety--My father!--What has been designed for him?&quot;
Julian heartily thanked him for his love.
&quot;Nay, it is not altogether out of love neither,&quot; said Lance, &quot;though I am as loving as another; but it is, as it were, partly out of fear, lest I be called over the coals for last night&#39;s matter; for as for the miners, they will never trouble them, as the creatures only act after their kind.&quot;
&quot;Nay, for that matter, it is not altogether fear, more than altogether love,&quot; answered the enigmatical keeper, &quot;although it hath a tasting of both in it.
&quot;I thought you too much of a man, Lance, to fear a woman marrying you whether you would or no.&quot;
&quot;And you, Lance,&quot; said Julian, &quot;have no mind to marry for cake and pudding.&quot;
But I never heard of true love lasting ten years; and hers, if it lives at all, must be nearer twenty.&quot;
&quot;Why,&quot; said the honest host, &quot;if that be the case, I must e&#39;en put one of you behind the bar, though the gentlemen have desired to be private; the other must take heart of grace and help me at the tap.&quot;
&quot;I apprehend you,&quot; replied his lordship; &quot;and meet your health with my love.
Trust me, my lord loves you, and longs for you.--Nay, I have done you reason.--By your leave, the cup is with me.
old Rowley, with his wit, and love of wit--his wildness, and love of wildness--he form a league with a silly, scrupulous, unidea&#39;d Puritan!--Not if she were Venus.&quot;
The villainous design which this discourse implied, and which his heart told him was designed against Alice Bridgenorth, stirred Julian so extremely, that he involuntarily shifted his posture, and laid his hand on his sword hilt.
This, light, young, gay in appearance, the thoughtless youth of wit and pleasure--the pigeon rather than the rook--but at heart the same sly, shrewd, cold-blooded calculator, as yonder old hard-featured professor of the same science, whose eyes are grown dim with watching of the dice at midnight; and whose fingers are even now assisting his mental computation of chances and of odds.
Why, the woman is thinking of murder--not of love.
&quot;The money for his satire, and the cudgel for his praise--Good--find him--give him the five pieces, and thrust the Countess&#39;s billet-doux--Hold--take Araminta&#39;s and the rest of them--thrust them all into his portfolio--All will come out at the Wit&#39;s Coffee-house; and if the promulgator be not cudgelled into all the colours of the rainbow, there is no spite in woman, no faith in crabtree, or pith in heart of oak--Araminta&#39;s wrath alone would overburden one pair of mortal shoulders.&quot;
&quot;My Lord Duke,&quot; said Christian, &quot;you are a worshipper of difficulties in state affairs, as in love matters.&quot;
&quot;In right of a woman,&quot; said the Duke; &quot;but, in troth, my godly dame owes me some advantage for having lived the first year of our marriage with her and old Black Tom, her grim, fighting, puritanic father.
A man might as well have married the Devil&#39;s daughter, and set up housekeeping with his father-in-law.
Kings do not love to court and sue; they should have their game run down for them.&quot;
Leave Chiffinch to fill his heart with a proper object.
He stopped short exactly at the point where, as an affectionate relative, he might be supposed to have said enough.
&quot;Have you not often confessed that the over excess of the carnal affection which you have entertained for your daughter, hath been a snare to you?--Have you not, more than once, been on the point of resigning those great designs which should place righteousness as a counsellor beside the throne, because you desired to gratify your daughter&#39;s girlish passion for this descendant of your old persecutor--this Julian Peveril?&quot;
&quot;Christian,&quot; said Bridgenorth, interrupting him, &quot;thou dost urge me hard; but thou dost it in love, my brother, and I forgive thee--Alice shall never be spurned.--But this friend of thine--this lady--thou art my child&#39;s uncle; and after me, thou art next to her in love and affection--Still, thou art not her father--hast not her father&#39;s fears.
The alarm excited by the damnable practices of the Papists has called up men&#39;s souls, and awakened their eyes to the dangers of their state.--He himself--for he will give up brother and wife to save himself--is not averse to a change of measures; and though we cannot at first see the Court purged as with a winnowing fan, yet there will be enough of the good to control the bad--enough of the sober party to compel the grant of that universal toleration, for which we have sighed so long, as a maiden for her beloved.
&quot;Still, my brother,&quot; said Bridgenorth, &quot;although I participate thy purpose, and have aided thee against this Moabitish woman, I cannot but think thy revenge is more after the law of Moses than after the law of love.&quot;
I will act by that counsel of thine, and will not even ask thee--though it may grieve my heart as a parent--with whom, or where, thou hast entrusted my child.
He then fled from his native island, burning with the desire of revenging his brother&#39;s death--the only passion foreign to his own gratification which he was ever known to cherish, and which was also, at least, partly selfish, since it concerned the restoration of his own fortunes.
He maintained a close and intimate correspondence with his native island, so as to be perfectly informed of whatever took place there; and he stimulated, on every favourable opportunity, the cupidity of Buckingham to possess himself of this petty kingdom, by procuring the forfeiture of its present Lord.
In this light it was exhibited to the Duke of Buckingham, who, either to sustain his character for daring gallantry, or in order to gratify some capricious fancy, had at one time made love to the reigning favourite, and experienced a repulse which he had never forgiven.
On the continent of Britain, however, no opposition was to be feared; and so well was Christian acquainted with all the motions in the interior of the Countess&#39;s little court, or household, that Peveril would have been arrested the instant he set foot on shore, but for the gale of wind which obliged the vessel, in which he was a passenger, to run for Liverpool.
It was towards this decoy that Fenella bent her way with unabated speed; and they were approaching a group of two or three gentlemen, who sauntered by its banks, when, on looking closely at him who appeared to be the chief of the party, Julian felt his heart beat uncommonly thick, as if conscious of approaching some one of the highest consequence.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Having muttered to himself this truly British resolution, the musician walked briskly on towards a large house near the bottom of St. James&#39;s Street, and entered the court, by a grated door from the Park, of which the mansion commanded an extensive prospect.
Julian was so situated, that he could, from the same casement through which Empson was peeping, observe a man in a laced roquelaure, and carrying his rapier under his arm, glide from the door by which he had himself entered, and out of the court, keeping as much as possible under the shade of the buildings.
&quot;Ay, madam, heavenly; for some very neat verses which we had at our festival say, &#39;What know we of the blest above, But that they sing and that they love?&#39;
But the lady&#39;s obvious love of scandal was the lure which very soon brought her again down from the dignified part which for a moment she assumed, and placed her once more on a gossiping level with her companion.
A regular _liaison_, like that of Chiffinch and his fair one, inferred little scandal; and such was his influence, as prime minister of his master&#39;s pleasures, that, as Charles himself expressed it, the lady whom we introduced to our readers in the last chapter, had obtained a brevet commission to rank as a married woman.
She inhabited a set of apartments called Chiffinch&#39;s--the scene of many an intrigue, both of love and politics; and where Charles often held his private parties for the evening, when, as frequently happened, the ill-humour of the Duchess of Portsmouth, his reigning Sultana, prevented his supping with her.
There was a heaviness at her heart which she could not dispel; and the few hours which she had already spent at Chiffinch&#39;s were like those passed in prison by one unconscious of the cause or event of his captivity.
&quot;Alice, my love--you mistake--that opposite door leads to your apartments.&quot;
To be foiled in a gallant intrigue, was to subject himself to the ridicule of his gay court; to persist in it by any means which approached to constraint, would have been tyrannical; and, what perhaps he might judge as severe an imputation, it would have been unbecoming a gentleman.
You cannot overreach your master, old as you think him, either in love or politics.
&quot;She has never ceased to love you, Alice,&quot; said her conductor, whose steps she continued to attend, even while declaring her resolution not to go with him, &quot;she never felt anything but kindness towards you, nay, towards your father; for though his dealings with us have been harsh, she can allow much for the provocation which he has received.
She touched the plume in her bonnet to remind him of the Earl--pointed to her heart, to imitate the Countess--raised her closed hand, as if to command him in their name--and next moment folded both, as if to supplicate him in her own; while pointing to Alice with an expression at once of angry and scornful derision, she waved her hand repeatedly and disdainfully, to intimate that Peveril ought to cast her off, as something undeserving his protection.
&quot;Ay,&quot; answered the taller, &quot;and the blue-eyed trembler looks as if she would fall behind into my loving arms.&quot;
Huge iron-clasped books lay before this ominous specimen of pinguitude--the records of the realm of misery, in which office he officiated as prime minister; and had Peveril come thither as an unconcerned visitor, his heart would have sunk within him at considering the mass of human wretchedness which must needs be registered in these fatal volumes.
Left quiet at least, if not alone, for the first time after the events of this troubled and varied day, Julian threw himself on an old oaken seat, beside the embers of a sea-coal fire, and began to muse on the miserable situation of anxiety and danger in which he was placed; where, whether he contemplated the interests of his love, his family affections, or his friendships, all seemed such a prospect as that of a sailor who looks upon breakers on every hand, from the deck of a vessel which no longer obeys the helm.
Depressed as his spirits were, Peveril could scarce forbear smiling when he looked at the pigmy creature, who told these stories with infinite complacency, and appeared disposed to proclaim, as his own herald, that he had been a very model of valour and gallantry, though love and arms seemed to be pursuits totally irreconcilable to his shrivelled, weather-beaten countenance, and wasted limbs.
Julian was, however, so careful to avoid giving his companion pain, that he endeavoured to humour him, by saying, that, &quot;unquestionably, one bred up like Sir Geoffrey Hudson, in court and camps, knew exactly when to suffer personal freedoms, and when to control them.&quot;
Now, as I really loved the youth, it was my intention only to correct him by a flesh wound or two; and I would willingly that he had named the sword for his weapon.
The tone of feeling in which the dwarfish hero concluded his story, gave Julian a better opinion of his heart, and even of his understanding, than he had been able to form of one who gloried in having, upon a grand occasion, formed the contents of a pasty.
But the religious act in which he had been engaged, only gave his discourse a more serious turn than belonged to his former themes, of war, lady&#39;s love, and courtly splendour.
The extremity to which he saw all that was dear to him at present reduced, struck a deeper cold on his heart than the iron upon his limbs; nor could he compose himself again to rest without a mental prayer to Heaven for protection.
&quot;I am a wretched being, but one who loves you well.--I come for your good.--Concern yourself no farther.&quot;
The little captive slept deep and heavy, as was evinced from his breathing; and upon listening a moment, Julian became again certain, either that his companion was the most artful of ventriloquists and of dissemblers, or that there was actually within the precincts of that guarded chamber, some third being, whose very presence there seemed to intimate that it belonged not to the ordinary line of humanity.
The dwarf imparted to his youthful companion a volume similar to that which formed his own studies, and which proved to be a tome of one of Scuderi&#39;s now forgotten romances, of which Geoffrey Hudson was a great admirer, and which were then very fashionable both at the French and English Courts; although they contrive to unite in their immense folios all the improbabilities and absurdities of the old romances of chivalry, without that tone of imagination which pervades them, and all the metaphysical absurdities which Cowley and the poets of the age had heaped upon the passion of love, like so many load of small coal upon a slender fire, which it smothers instead of aiding.
Julian&#39;s heart throbbed; for might not one of those grates have been so tampered with as to give entrance to the nocturnal visitant?
Indeed, had he not stumbled on this abstruse subject of calculation, there is no guessing how long he might have held forth upon the superiority of men of little stature, which was so great a favourite with him, that, numerous as such narratives are, the dwarf had collected almost all the instances of their victories over giants, which history or romance afforded.
No answer of any kind was returned to this invocation; nor did the least sound intimate the presence of the being to whom it was so solemnly addressed.
He now reflected that he had no ground to consider the motives of his visitor as positively malevolent, although he had afforded him little encouragement to hope for assistance on the points he had most at heart.
If your heart can resolve to give up an attachment which it should never have entertained, and which it would be madness to cherish longer, make your acquiescence in this condition known by putting on your hat a white band, or white feather, or knot of ribbon of the same colour, whichever you may most easily come by.
Julian had no alternative but to take the fellow&#39;s hint and administer a bribe, with which Master Clink was so well satisfied, that he exclaimed, &quot;It went to his heart to take leave of such a kind-natured gentleman, and that he could have turned the key on him for twenty years with pleasure.
For myself, my race is near a close, and that because I fall martyr to the over-tenderness of my own heart.
Yet this custom, however recommended by state policy, must have often struck chill upon the heart of the criminal, who thus, stolen, as it were, out of society, reached the place of his confinement, without encountering even one glance of compassion on the road; and as, from under the dusky arch, he landed on those flinty steps, worn by many a footstep anxious as his own, against which the tide lapped fitfully with small successive waves, and hence looked forward to the steep ascent into a Gothic state prison, and backward to such part of the river as the low-brow&#39;d vault suffered to become visible, he must often have felt that he was leaving daylight, hope, and life itself, behind him.
&quot;Ah, Master Coleby,&quot; said his comrade, in a gentle tone of reproach, &quot;you would have been wearing a better coat than a yeoman&#39;s to-day, had it not been for your tender heart.&quot;
&quot;It signifies little,&quot; said old Coleby, &quot;while my heart is true to my King, what I feel in discharging my duty, or what coat keeps my old bosom from the cold weather.&quot;
Peveril, meanwhile, folded in his breast the token of his mother&#39;s affection which chance had favoured him with; and when placed in the small and solitary chamber which he was told to consider as his own during his residence in the Tower, he was soothed even to weeping by this trifling circumstance, which he could not help considering as an omen, that his unfortunate house was not entirely deserted by Providence.
But during the increasing rage for building new streets, and the creating of almost an additional town, in order to connect London and Westminster, this ground had become of very great value; and the second Duke of Buckingham, who was at once fond of scheming, and needy of money, had agreed to a plan laid before him by some adventurous architect, for converting the extensive grounds around his palace into those streets, lanes, and courts, which still perpetuate his name and titles; though those who live in Buckingham Street, Duke Street, Villiers Street, or in Of-alley (for even that connecting particle is locally commemorated), probably think seldom of the memory of the witty, eccentric, and licentious George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, whose titles are preserved in the names of their residence and its neighbourhood.
They alleged, that, engaged as he was in so many mysteries of love and of politics, and having the character of the most daring and dangerous intriguer of his time, his Grace found it convenient to surround himself with this ruinous arena, into which officers of justice could not penetrate without some difficulty and hazard; and which might afford, upon occasion, a safe and secret shelter for such tools as were fit for desperate enterprises, and a private and unobserved mode of access to those whom he might have any special reason for receiving in secret.
Thou mayst perchance have seen me also have a fancy to play at trap-ball, or to kiss a serving wench, or to guzzle ale and eat toasted cheese in a porterly whimsy; but is it fitting thou shouldst remember such follies?
&quot;Jerningham,&quot; he said, &quot;thou art a faithful fellow, and it would be sin not to cherish thee.
Out came the cause; and with such humility, such penitence, such throwing herself on my mercy (she the proudest devil, too, in the whole Court), that I must have had heart of steel to resist it all.
&quot;My lord, I sell my blood and my sword, but not my honour,&quot; answered the man sullenly; &quot;if I marry, my bed may be a poor, but it shall be an honest one.&quot;
But for marrying a cast-off mistress, the man (saving your Grace, to whom I am bound) lives not who dares propose it to me.&quot;
&quot;Now, there goes a scoundrel after my own heart,&quot; said the Duke; &quot;a robber from his cradle, a murderer since he could hold a knife, a profound hypocrite in religion, and a worse and deeper hypocrite in honour,--would sell his soul to the devil to accomplish any villainy, and would cut the throat of his brother, did he dare to give the villainy he had so acted its right name.--Now, why stand you amazed, good Master Jerningham, and look on me as you would on some monster of Ind, when you had paid your shilling to see it, and were staring out your pennyworth with your eyes as round as a pair of spectacles?
&quot;Well, say on, I can bear it,&quot; said the Duke, throwing himself into an easy-chair, and using his toothpick with graceful indifference and equanimity; &quot;I love to hear what such potsherds as thou art, think of the proceeding of us who are of the pure porcelain clay of the earth.&quot;
With hands and eyes uplifted, Jerningham left the apartment; and the Duke, without thinking a moment farther on old or new intrigues--on the friendship he had formed, or the enmity he had provoked--on the beauty whom he had carried off from her natural protectors, as well as from her lover--or on the monarch against whom he had placed himself in rivalship,--sat down to calculate chances with all the zeal of Demoivre, tired of the drudgery in half-an-hour, and refused to see the zealous agent whom he had employed in the city, because he was busily engaged in writing a new lampoon.
changeful head, and fickle heart!
While her virtue defied his seductions, he ruined her under colour of a mock marriage, and was rewarded for a success which occasioned the death of his victim, by the general applause of the men of wit and gallantry who filled the drawing-room of Charles.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>On his own part, he had none of those feelings of anxiety with which a man, even of the most vulgar mind, comes to the presence of the female whom he wishes to please, far less the more refined sentiments of love, respect, desire, and awe, with which the more refined lover approaches the beloved object.
Among the jealousies and fears expressed by the Long Parliament, they insisted much upon an agent for the King departing for the continent so abruptly, that he had not time to change his court dress--white buskins, to wit, and black silk pantaloons--for an equipment more suitable to travel with.
are you neither afraid of my resentment, nor of my love, fair Zarah?&quot;
&quot;Your resentment must be a pretty passion indeed, if it could stoop to such a helpless object as I am; and for your love--good lack!
&quot;Think you Buckingham cannot love, or has never been beloved in return?&quot;
&quot;He may have thought himself beloved,&quot; said the maiden; &quot;but by what slight creatures!--things whose heads could be rendered giddy by a playhouse rant--whose brains were only filled with red-heeled shoes and satin buskins--and who run altogether mad on the argument of a George and a star.&quot;
&quot;There are,&quot; said the lady; &quot;but men rate them as parrots and monkeys--things without either sense or soul, head or heart.
Who can consent to part with a tongue of so much melody, or an eye of such expressive eloquence!--You have known then what it is to love?&quot;
&quot;I know--no matter if by experience, or through the report of others--but I do know, that to love, as I would love, would be to yield not an iota to avarice, not one inch to vanity, not to sacrifice the slightest feeling to interest or to ambition; but to give up all to fidelity of heart and reciprocal affection.&quot;
&quot;I have neither allowed you a heart nor a head,&quot; said Zarah calmly.--&quot;Nay, never redden as if you would fly at me.
Such a man were one for whom a woman&#39;s heart should beat constant while he breathes, and break when he dies.&quot;
&quot;You speak,&quot; said the Duke, &quot;as if you had yourself a heart which could pay the full tribute to the merit which you describe so warmly.&quot;
&quot;Your wealth, your titles, your reputation as a gallant--all you possess, were too little to merit such sincere affection.&quot;
Bethink you, that if your love be as pure as coined gold, still a poor fellow like myself may offer you an equivalent in silver--The quantity of my affection must make up for its quality.&quot;
&quot;But I am not carrying my affection to market, my lord; and therefore I need none of the base coin you offer in change for it.&quot;
Inflamed alike by mortification and curiosity, Buckingham at first entertained some thought of following her by the same dangerous route, and had actually got upon the sill of the window for that purpose; and was contemplating what might be his next safe movement, when, from a neighbouring thicket of shrubs, amongst which his visitor had disappeared, he heard her chant a verse of a comic song, then much in fashion, concerning a despairing lover who had recourse to a precipice-- &quot;But when he came near, Beholding how steep The sides did appear, And the bottom how deep; Though his suit was rejected, He sadly reflected, That a lover forsaken A new love may get; But a neck that&#39;s once broken Can never be set.&quot;
through Saint James Park to the garden, where I both saw and heard a very familiar discourse between... [_the King_] and Mrs. Nelly, as they called her, an intimate comedian, she looking out of her garden on a terrace at the top of the wall, and [_the King_] standing on the green walk under it.
Madam Chiffinch cried for spite, and transgressed Solomon&#39;s warning, by cursing the King in her heart; but had no better course than to return to Westminster, and direct Chaubert&#39;s preparations for the evening.
I supposed you must have served as a Yeoman of the Guard since bluff King Henry&#39;s time, and expected to hear something from you about the Field of the Cloth of Gold,--and I thought of asking you the colour of Anne Bullen&#39;s breastknot, which cost the Pope three kingdoms; but I am afraid you are but a novice in such recollections of love and chivalry.
A number of others brought forward facts or suspicions, affecting the character of the parties as honest Protestants and good subjects; and betwixt the direct and presumptive evidence, enough was usually extracted for justifying, to a corrupted court and perjured jury, the fatal verdict of Guilty.
It was a piteous sight to behold a father and son, who had been so long separated, meet under circumstances so melancholy; and many tears were shed, when the majestic old man--for such he was, though now broken with years--folded his son to his bosom, with a mixture of joy, affection, and a bitter anticipation of the event of the impending trial.
repeated Sir Geoffrey the less; &quot;_Pshaw_ is an expression of slight esteem,--nay, of contempt,--in all languages; and were this a befitting place----&quot; But the Judges had now taken their places, the criers called silence, and the stern voice of the Lord Chief Justice (the notorious Scroggs) demanded what the officers meant by permitting the accused to communicate together in open court.
&quot;[*] [*] It was on such terms that Dr. Oates was pleased to claim the extraordinary privilege of dealing out the information which he chose to communicate to a court of justice.
Doctor Oates retired from the witness-box reddening like a turkey-cock, as one totally unused to have such accounts questioned as he chose to lay before the courts of justice; and there was, perhaps, for the first time, amongst the counsel and solicitors, as well as the templars and students of law there present, a murmur, distinct and audible, unfavourable to the character of the great father of the Popish Plot.
But a warmer sentiment awakened among those who saw the father and son throw themselves into each other&#39;s arms, and, after a hearty embrace, extend their hands to their poor little companion in peril, who, like a dog, when present at a similar scene, had at last succeeded, by stretching himself up to them and whimpering at the same time, to secure to himself a portion of their sympathy and gratulation.
&quot;He himself,&quot; he said, as he reposed himself after the glorious conquest in which he had some share, &quot;had been favoured with a beatific vision, too splendid to be described to common and mere mortal ears, but which had commanded him, in a voice to which his heart had bounded as to a trumpet sound, to take refuge with the worthy person of the house, and cause his friends to do so.&quot;
The father and son, therefore, hastily thanked the officer and his party, as well as the other gentlemen who had volunteered in their assistance, lifted little Sir Geoffrey Hudson from the conspicuous post which he had so creditably occupied during the skirmish, and followed the footsteps of the tenant of the booth, who conducted them down a blind alley and through one or two courts, in case, as he said, any one might have watched where they burrowed, and so into a back-door.
&quot;Odzooks,&quot; said the old Cavalier; &quot;and had I known it was thy house, man, I would sooner had my heart&#39;s blood run down the kennel, than my foot should have crossed your threshold--in the way of seeking safety, that is.&quot;
By Saint George I have sworn, if ever I got my heels out of yon rascally prison, whither I was sent much through your means, Master Bridgenorth,--that you should pay the reckoning for my bad lodging.--I will strike no man in his own house; but if you will cause the fellow to bring back my weapon, and take a turn in that blind court there below, along with me, you shall soon see what chance a traitor hath with a true man, and a kennel-blooded Puritan with Peveril of the Peak.&quot;
&quot;Why,&quot; said the Duke, &quot;I had caused my little Quodling to go through his oration thus--&#39;That whatever evil reports had passed current during the lifetime of the worthy matron whom they had restored to dust that day, malice herself could not deny that she was born well, married well, lived well, and died well; since she was born in Shadwell, married to Cresswell, lived in Camberwell, and died in Bridewell.&#39;
I have crossed his path in state intrigue--rivalled him in love--had the advantage in both,--and, d--n it, he has forgiven me!
&quot;Will any one now assert,&quot; he said, with self-complacence, &quot;that I am so utterly negligent of the interest of friends?--You see the peril in which I place myself, and even the risk to which I have exposed the public peace, to rescue a man whom I have scarce seen for twenty years, and then only in his buff-coat and bandoleers, with other Train-Band officers who kissed hands upon the Restoration.
In one place, a group of the young nobility, and of the ladies of the Court, listened to the reader&#39;s acquaintance Empson, who was accompanying with his unrivalled breathings on the flute, a young siren, who, while her bosom palpitated with pride and with fear, warbled to the courtly and august presence the beautiful air beginning-- &quot;Young I am, and yet unskill&#39;d, How to make a lover yield,&quot; &amp;c. She performed her task in a manner so corresponding with the strains of the amatory poet, and the voluptuous air with which the words had been invested by the celebrated Purcel, that the men crowded around in ecstasies, while most of the ladies thought it proper either to look extremely indifferent to the words she sung, or to withdraw from the circle as quietly as possible.
Her Grace is an entire raree-show in her own person--a universal masquerade--indeed a sort of private Bedlam-hospital, her whole ideas being like so many patients crazed upon the subjects of love and literature, who act nothing in their vagaries, save Minerva, Venus, and the nine Muses.&quot;
The surprise was no pleasing one to the King; and cursing in his heart the rashness which had allowed the lady entrance on the gay scene in which they were engaged, he saw at the same time the necessity of receiving her in a manner suitable to his own character, and her rank in the British Court.
&quot;A legal penalty was, as we remember, incurred by an act of irregular violence--so our courts and our laws term it, though personally I have no objection to call it, with you, an honourable revenge.
&quot;And were I to kiss the block there,&quot; said the Countess, &quot;as did my husband at Bolton-on-the-Moors, I would do so willingly, rather than forsake a friend!--and one, too, whom, as in the case of the younger Peveril, I have thrust upon danger.&quot;
His declaration, though singular, was quite coherent; the strain of romance intermingled with it, being in fact a part of his character, which often gained him the fate of being laughed at, when he would otherwise have been pitied, or even esteemed.
But she would not listen to me, saying hastily, &#39;I would be intercepted, or refused admittance, and that I must embrace the means she offered me of introduction into the presence, and when there, tell the King to be on his guard--little more is necessary; for once the scheme is known, it becomes desperate.&#39;
Words, he said, could not express the agony which he felt when he found that his bearer, in placing the instrument in a corner, was about to invert its position, in which case, he said, human frailty might have proved too great for love, for loyalty, for true obedience, nay, for the fear of death, which was like to ensue on discovery; and he concluded, that he greatly doubted he could not have stood on his head for many minutes without screaming aloud.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>On re-entering the house, which he did by a circuitous passage, leading from a distant alley, and through several courts, Christian hastened to a low matted apartment, in which Bridgenorth sat alone, reading the Bible by the light of a small brazen lamp, with the utmost serenity of countenance.
&quot;Thou art a spoiled child, Zarah, and dost but abuse the indulgence I entertain for your freakish humour,&quot; replied Christian; &quot;thy wits have been disturbed since ever you landed in England, and all for the sake of one who cares for thee no more than for the most worthless object who walks the streets, amongst whom he left you to engage in a brawl for one he loved better.&quot;
&quot;It is no matter,&quot; said Zarah, obviously repressing very bitter emotion; &quot;it signifies not that he loves another better; there is none--no, none--that ever did, or can, love him so well.&quot;
But there is _one_,&quot; she added, looking upward, &quot;who never taunted me; one whose generous feelings could treat the poor dumb girl even as his sister; who never spoke word of her but was to excuse or defend--and you tell me I must not love him, and that it is madness to love him!--I _will_ be mad then, for I will love till the latest breath of my life!&quot;
Think what I have proposed to thee, for the loss of this hopeless affection, a career so brilliant!--Think only that it rests with thyself to be the wife--the wedded wife--of the princely Buckingham!
With my talents--with thy wit and beauty--with his passionate love of these attributes--a short space might rank you among England&#39;s princesses.--Be but guided by me--he is now at deadly pass--needs every assistance to retrieve his fortunes--above all, that which we alone can render him.
She paused and answered, &quot;While a noble motive fired thee--ay, a noble motive, though irregular--for I was born to gaze on the sun which the pale daughters of Europe shrink from--I could serve thee--I could have followed, while revenge or ambition had guided thee--but love of _wealth_, and by what means acquired!--What sympathy can I hold with that?--Wouldst thou not have pandered to the lust of the King, though the object was thine own orphan niece?--You smile?--Smile again when I ask you whether you meant not my own prostitution, when you charged me to remain in the house of that wretched Buckingham?--Smile at that question, and by Heaven, I stab you to the heart!&quot;
&quot;Vain flatterer,&quot; said Zarah, yet seeming soothed even by the flattery which she scoffed at, &quot;you would persuade me that it was honourable love which you expected the Duke was to have offered me.
&quot;You do me injustice, Zarah,&quot; said Christian--&quot;I found you capable of the avenging of your father&#39;s death--I consecrated you to it, as I consecrated my own life and hopes; and you held the duty sacred, till these mad feeling towards a youth who loves your cousin----&quot; &quot;Who--loves--my--cousin,&quot; repeated Zarah (for we will continue to call her by her real name) slowly, and as if the words dropped unconsciously from her lips.
&quot;Well--be it so!--Man of many wiles, I will follow thy course for a little, a very little farther; but take heed--tease me not with remonstrances against the treasure of my secret thoughts--I mean my most hopeless affection to Julian Peveril--and bring me not as an assistant to any snare which you may design to cast around him.
I tell you, that yon very miserable dwarf, whom I made my sport in the prison--yon wretched abortion of nature, I would select for a husband, ere I would marry your Buckingham;--the vain and imbecile pigmy has yet the warm heart and noble feelings, that a man should hold his highest honour.&quot;
The apparition of the female to him in the cell of Newgate, he described in such fanciful and romantic colours, that the King could not help thinking the poor man&#39;s head a little turned; and, as nothing was found in the kettledrum, and other musical instruments brought for the use of the Duke&#39;s band of foreigners, he nourished some slight hope that the whole plan might be either a mere jest, or that the idea of an actual conspiracy was founded in mistake.
And these, gliding back into the hall, communicated in whispers that the sentinels at the gates were doubled, and that there was a troop of the Horse Guards drawn up in the court--circumstances so unusual, as to excite the most anxious curiosity.
On entering the court, the flambeaux which were borne around the carriage gleamed on the scarlet coats, laced hats, and drawn broadswords of the Horse Guards--a sight unusual, and calculated to strike terror into a conscience which was none of the clearest.
He was no chicken, though a cock of the game, when he joined the Marquis of Hertford at Namptwich with two hundred wild Welshmen.--Before George, Julian, I love that girl as if she was my own flesh and blood!
Whilst Sir Geoffrey thus run on, the meeting betwixt Alice and Julian Peveril was accomplished, without any particular notice on his side, except to say, &quot;Kiss her, Julian--kiss her.
It came upon him, indeed, with the more joyful surprise that he had received a previous hint, ere he left the court of justice, that it would be prudent in him to go down to Martindale before presenting himself at Court--a restriction which he supposed as repugnant to his Majesty&#39;s feelings as it was to his own.
A moment afterwards, at a signal from the Countess, Fenella, or Zarah, stepped forward, and having kissed her lady&#39;s hand, stood with her arms folded on her breast, with a humble air, as different from that which she wore in the harem of the Duke of Buckingham, as that of a Magdalene from a Judith.
Come, Villiers, rise--I forgive thee, and only recommend one act of penance--the curse you yourself bestowed on the dog who bit you--marriage, and retirement to your country-seat.&quot;
Now, if Lady Derby will contrive either to place her hand near the region of the damsel&#39;s heart, or at least on her arm, so that she can feel the sensation of the blood when the pulse increases, then do you, my Lord of Ormond, beckon Julian Peveril out of sight--I will show you in a moment that it can stir at sounds spoken.&quot;
Here is a plot without a drop of blood; and all the elements of a romance, without its conclusion.
Here we have a wandering island princess (I pray my Lady of Derby&#39;s pardon), a dwarf, a Moorish sorceress, an impenitent rogue, and a repentant man of rank, and yet all ends without either hanging or marriage.&quot;
&quot;They love each other like lovers of the last age,&quot; said the Countess; &quot;but the stout old Knight likes not the round-headed alliance.&quot;

Neither of our pedestrians had much heart for these things, and they looked around for a refreshment tent among the many which dotted the down.
The ruin of good men by bad wives, and, more particularly, the frustration of many a promising youth’s high aims and hopes and the extinction of his energies by an early imprudent marriage, was the theme.
“I married at eighteen, like the fool that I was; and this is the consequence o’t.” He pointed at himself and family with a wave of the hand intended to bring out the penuriousness of the exhibition.
“Behave yerself moral, good man, for Heaven’s love!
Ah, what a cruelty is the poor soul married to!
In contrast with the harshness of the act just ended within the tent was the sight of several horses crossing their necks and rubbing each other lovingly as they waited in patience to be harnessed for the homeward journey.
And this I swear upon the book before me; and may I be strook dumb, blind, and helpless, if I break this my oath!” When he had said it and kissed the big book, the hay-trusser arose, and seemed relieved at having made a start in a new direction.
They walked with joined hands, and it could be perceived that this was the act of simple affection.
It was edged with black, and inscribed within a design resembling a mural tablet were the words, “In affectionate memory of Richard Newson, mariner, who was unfortunately lost at sea, in the month of November 184—, aged forty-one years.” “And it was here,” continued her mother, with more hesitation, “that I last saw the relation we are going to look for—Mr.
I have never clearly had it told me.” “He is, or was—for he may be dead—a connection by marriage,” said her mother deliberately.
She pretended to eat a little of the furmity with the leaden spoon offered, and as she did so said blandly to the hag, “You’ve seen better days?” “Ah, ma’am—well ye may say it!” responded the old woman, opening the sluices of her heart forthwith.
Ma’am you’d hardly believe that I was once the owner of a great pavilion-tent that was the attraction of the fair.
“I can mind every serious fight o’ married parties, every murder, every manslaughter, even every pocket-picking—leastwise large ones—that ’t has been my lot to witness.
The risk of endangering a child’s strong affection by disturbing ideas which had grown with her growth was to Mrs. Henchard too fearful a thing to contemplate.
But Susan Henchard’s fear of losing her dearly loved daughter’s heart by a revelation had little to do with any sense of wrong-doing on her own part.
The desire—sober and repressed—of Elizabeth-Jane’s heart was indeed to see, to hear, and to understand.
Very few persons were now in the street; and his eyes, by a sort of attraction, turned and dwelt upon a spot about a hundred yards further down.
Moreover, this being at a time before home-brewing was abandoned by the smaller victuallers, and a house in which the twelve-bushel strength was still religiously adhered to by the landlord in his ale, the quality of the liquor was the chief attraction of the premises, so that everything had to make way for utensils and operations in connection therewith.
’A was always such a man of underthoughts.” (And reprovingly towards Christopher): “Don’t ye be so over-familiar with a gentleman that ye know nothing of—and that’s travelled a’most from the North Pole.” Christopher Coney was silenced, and as he could get no public sympathy, he mumbled his feelings to himself: “Be dazed, if I loved my country half as well as the young feller do, I’d live by claning my neighbour’s pigsties afore I’d go away!
For my part I’ve no more love for my country than I have for Botany Bay!” “Come,” said Longways; “let the young man draw onward with his ballet, or we shall be here all night.” “That’s all of it,” said the singer apologetically.
Casterbridge had sentiment—Casterbridge had romance; but this stranger’s sentiment was of differing quality.
Over the pavement on the sunny side of the way hung shopblinds so constructed as to give the passenger’s hat a smart buffet off his head, as from the unseen hands of Cranstoun’s Goblin Page, celebrated in romantic lore.
“I am sent to tell you, sir,” she innocently went on, “that a distant relative of yours by marriage, Susan Newson, a sailor’s widow, is in the town, and to ask whether you would wish to see her.” The rich _rouge-et-noir_ of his countenance underwent a slight change.
“Yes, sir.” “Are you her daughter?” “Yes, sir—her only daughter.” “What—do you call yourself—your Christian name?” “Elizabeth-Jane, sir.” “Newson?” “Elizabeth-Jane Newson.” This at once suggested to Henchard that the transaction of his early married life at Weydon Fair was unrecorded in the family history.
Tradition reports that at a certain stage of the burning her heart burst and leapt out of her body, to the terror of them all, and that not one of those ten thousand people ever cared particularly for hot roast after that.
“I have thought of this plan: that you and Elizabeth take a cottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter; that I meet you, court you, and marry you.
How could she ever suppose such a thing?” “True!” “I like the idea of repeating our marriage,” said Mrs. Henchard, after a pause.
“I began life as a working hay-trusser, and when I was eighteen I married on the strength o’ my calling.
Would you think me a married man?” “I heard in the town that you were a widower.” “Ah, yes—you would naturally have heard that.
But being together in the same house, and her feeling warm, we got naturally intimate.
It is enough to say that we honestly meant to marry.
When I was gone she suffered much on my account, and didn’t forget to tell me so in letters one after another; till latterly, I felt I owed her something, and thought that, as I had not heard of Susan for so long, I would make this other one the only return I could make, and ask her if she would run the risk of Susan being alive (very slight as I believed) and marry me, such as I was.
My wife Susan has my daughter with her—the baby that was in her arms at the fair; and this girl knows nothing of me beyond that I am some sort of relation by marriage.
Her mother and I be going to marry again; and it will not only help us to keep our child’s respect, but it will be more proper.
Nobody would have conceived from his outward demeanour that there was no amatory fire or pulse of romance acting as stimulant to the bustle going on in his gaunt, great house; nothing but three large resolves—one, to make amends to his neglected Susan, another, to provide a comfortable home for Elizabeth-Jane under his paternal eye; and a third, to castigate himself with the thorns which these restitutory acts brought in their train; among them the lowering of his dignity in public opinion by marrying so comparatively humble a woman.
“Be cust if I’d marry any such as he, or thee either,” replied that lady.
Lest she should pine for deeper affection than he could give he made a point of showing some semblance of it in external action.
The reposeful, easy, affluent life to which her mother’s marriage had introduced her was, in truth, the beginning of a great change in Elizabeth.
Her quiet eye discerned that Henchard’s tigerish affection for the younger man, his constant liking to have Farfrae near him, now and then resulted in a tendency to domineer, which, however, was checked in a moment when Donald exhibited marks of real offence.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Why would I be?” “I only supposed you might be from the song you sang at the Three Mariners—about Scotland and home, I mean—which you seemed to feel so deep down in your heart; so that we all felt for you.” “Ay—and I did sing there—I did—— But, Miss Newson”—and Donald’s voice musically undulated between two semi-tones as it always did when he became earnest—“it’s well you feel a song for a few minutes, and your eyes they get quite tearful; but you finish it, and for all you felt you don’t mind it or think of it again for a long while.
On Henchard’s part there was now again repose; and yet, whenever he thought of Farfrae, it was with a dim dread; and he often regretted that he had told the young man his whole heart, and confided to him the secrets of his life.
But in the morning, when his jealous temper had passed away, his heart sank within him at what he had said and done.
Her heart fluttered when she heard of this step of Donald’s, proving that he meant to remain; and yet, would a man who cared one little bit for her have endangered his suit by setting up a business in opposition to Mr. Henchard’s?
To solve the problem whether her appearance on the evening of the dance were such as to inspire a fleeting love at first sight, she dressed herself up exactly as she had dressed then—the muslin, the spencer, the sandals, the parasol—and looked in the mirror.
Hence, when she felt her heart going out to him, she would say to herself with a mock pleasantry that carried an ache with it, “No, no, Elizabeth-Jane—such dreams are not for you!” She tried to prevent herself from seeing him, and thinking of him; succeeding fairly well in the former attempt, in the latter not so completely.
Upon my heart and soul, if ever I should be left in a position to carry out that marriage with thee, I _ought_ to do it—I ought to do it, indeed!” The contingency that he had in his mind was, of course, the death of Mrs. Henchard.
“I—wanted you to marry Mr. Farfrae.” “O mother!” Elizabeth-Jane bent down her head so much that she looked quite into her own lap.
And open the windows as soon as I am carried out, and make it as cheerful as you can for Elizabeth-Jane.’” “Ah, poor heart!” “Well, and Martha did it, and buried the ounce pennies in the garden.
What you saw was our second marriage.
“Yes—I’d rather.” “Very well.” She got a piece of paper, and bending over the fender wrote at his dictation words which he had evidently got by heart from some advertisement or other—words to the effect that she, the writer, hitherto known as Elizabeth-Jane Newson, was going to call herself Elizabeth-Jane Henchard forthwith.
Elizabeth was his at last and she was a girl of such good sense and kind heart that she would be sure to like him.
He was the kind of man to whom some human object for pouring out his heart upon—were it emotive or were it choleric—was almost a necessity.
The craving for his heart for the re-establishment of this tenderest human tie had been great during his wife’s lifetime, and now he had submitted to its mastery without reluctance and without fear.
In words he could blame his wife, but not in his heart; and had he obeyed the wise directions outside her letter this pain would have been spared him for long—possibly for ever, Elizabeth-Jane seeming to show no ambition to quit her safe and secluded maiden courses for the speculative path of matrimony.
Newson—whom my poor mother married by such a strange mistake” (Henchard was glad that he had disguised matters here), “was very kind—O so kind!” (she spoke with tears in her eyes); “but that is not the same thing as being one’s real father after all.
Henchard bent and kissed her cheek.
He had done it in an ardour and an agitation which had half carried the point of affection with her; yet, behold, from the next morning onwards his manner was constrained as she had never seen it before.
he’ll think it means peace, and a marriage portion—not that I don’t want my house to be troubled with her, and no portion at all!” He wrote as follows:— Sir,—On consideration, I don’t wish to interfere with your courtship of Elizabeth-Jane, if you care for her.
“I would, indeed—I would do anything to be independent; for then perhaps my father might get to love me.
When the lamps were lighted, and it was yet not so dark as to render chimneys, attics, and roofs invisible, Elizabeth, almost with a lover’s feeling, thought she would like to look at the outside of High-Place Hall.
Elizabeth trotted through the open door in the dusk, but becoming alarmed at her own temerity she went quickly out again by another which stood open in the lofty wall of the back court.
He had gone on thence into the court, and inquired of a man whom he saw unpacking china from a crate if Miss Le Sueur was living there.
Lucetta was rather addicted to scribbling, as had been shown by the torrent of letters after the _fiasco_ in their marriage arrangements, and hardly had Elizabeth gone away when another note came to the Mayor’s house from High-Place Hall.
“You probably are aware of my arrangement with your daughter, and have doubtless laughed at the—what shall I call it?—practical joke (in all affection) of my getting her to live with me.
She was plainly in a very coming-on disposition for marriage.
But what else could a poor woman be who had given her time and her heart to him so thoughtlessly, at that former time, as to lose her credit by it?
Probably conscience no less than affection had brought her here.
It may at once be declared that Lucetta no longer bore towards Henchard all that warm allegiance which had characterized her in their first acquaintance, the then unfortunate issue of things had chilled pure love considerably.
With strong social reasons on her side why their marriage should take place there had ceased to be any worldly reason on his why it should be postponed, since she had succeeded to fortune.
At first he had taken no notice of Henchard’s brusque letter; but an exceptionally fortunate business transaction put him on good terms with everybody, and revealed to him that he could undeniably marry if he chose.
The farmer would not take the crust without the crumb of the bargain, in other words, the old man without the younger; and the son had a sweetheart on his present farm, who stood by, waiting the issue with pale lips.
O, if I had my wish, I’d let people live and love at their pleasure!” “Maybe I can manage that they’ll not be parted,” said Farfrae.
Her heart longed for some ark into which it could fly and be at rest.
She could see by his gait that he was conscious of her eyes, and her heart went out to him for his modesty—pleaded with her sense of his unfitness that he might be allowed to come again.
For in addition to Lucetta’s house being a home, that raking view of the market-place which it afforded had as much attraction for her as for Lucetta.
Each grain will go straight to its intended place, and nowhere else whatever!” “Then the romance of the sower is gone for good,” observed Elizabeth-Jane, who felt herself at one with Farfrae in Bible-reading at least.
Lucetta, discerning that he was much mixed that day, partly in his mercantile mood and partly in his romantic one, said gaily to him— “Well, don’t forsake the machine for us,” and went indoors with her companion.
At last the obstacle which separated them was providentially removed; and he came to marry her.” “How delightful!” “But in the interval she—my poor friend—had seen a man, she liked better than him.
With no love you might calculate on ten.” Lucetta seemed to reflect on this as on an unalterable, impartial verdict.
The next phase of the supersession of Henchard in Lucetta’s heart was an experiment in calling on her performed by Farfrae with some apparent trepidation.
The Scotchman seemed hardly the same Farfrae who had danced with her and walked with her in a delicate poise between love and friendship—that period in the history of a love when alone it can be said to be unalloyed with pain.
But you know, Lucetta, I felt directly my poor ill-used Susan died, and when I could not bear the idea of marrying again, that after what had happened between us it was my duty not to let any unnecessary delay occur before putting things to rights.
Lucetta’s face became—as a woman’s face becomes when the man she loves rises upon her gaze like an apparition.
“I will love him!” she cried passionately; “as for _him_—he’s hot-tempered and stern, and it would be madness to bind myself to him knowing that.
I won’t be a slave to the past—I’ll love where I choose!” Yet having decided to break away from Henchard one might have supposed her capable of aiming higher than Farfrae.
But Lucetta reasoned nothing: she feared hard words from the people with whom she had been earlier associated; she had no relatives left; and with native lightness of heart took kindly to what fate offered.
Elizabeth-Jane, surveying the position of Lucetta between her two lovers from the crystalline sphere of a straightforward mind, did not fail to perceive that her father, as she called him, and Donald Farfrae became more desperately enamoured of her friend every day.
So she viewed with an approach to equanimity the now cancelled days when Donald had been her undeclared lover, and wondered what unwished-for thing Heaven might send her in place of him.
“Yes.” “Well, I have offered to marry her now that I can; but she won’t marry me.
And now he sat at her tea-table eager to gain her attention, and in his amatory rage feeling the other man present to be a villain, just as any young fool of a lover might feel.
Farfrae tried to laugh; but he was too much in love to see the incident in any but a tragic light.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“Why, you see, sir, all the women side with Farfrae—being a damn young dand—of the sort that he is—one that creeps into a maid’s heart like the giddying worm into a sheep’s brain—making crooked seem straight to their eyes!” “But do you know who that lady is you talk about in such a fashion?
“Speak what you like.” “Well, then,” replied Farfrae, with the unmistakable inflection of the lover pure, which Henchard had never heard in full resonance of his lips before, “you are sure to be much sought after for your position, wealth, talents, and beauty.
“You are convinced, Donald, that I love nobody else,” she presently said.
Had I found that you proposed to marry me for pure love I might have felt bound now.
After that I did not care for you so deeply as before.” “Why did you come here to find me, then?” “I thought I ought to marry you for conscience’ sake, since you were free, even though I—did not like you so well.” “And why then don’t you think so now?” She was silent.
It was only too obvious that conscience had ruled well enough till new love had intervened and usurped that rule.
Henchard saw its bitterness; and had Lucetta’s heart been given to any other man in the world than Farfrae he would probably have had pity upon her at that moment.
“Elizabeth-Jane,” he said, taking her hand, “I want you to hear this.” And turning to Lucetta: “Will you, or will you not, marry me?
And how is it he has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against your will?
Ah—you have many many secrets from me!” “Perhaps you have some from me,” Lucetta murmured with closed eyes, little thinking, however, so unsuspicious was she, that the secret of Elizabeth’s heart concerned the young man who had caused this damage to her own.
“Gutter, yes, Stubberd.” “Spot measuring twelve feet nine inches or thereabouts from where I—” Still careful not to outrun the clerk’s penmanship Stubberd pulled up again; for having got his evidence by heart it was immaterial to him whereabouts he broke off.
The truth was that the old woman had appeared in court so many more times than the magistrates themselves, that they were obliged to keep a sharp look-out upon their procedure.
And to keep out of any temptation to treat her hard for her revenge, I’ll leave her to you.” The sensation in the court was indescribably great.
Elizabeth’s face, as soon as she recognized her friend, shaped itself into affectionate lines while yet beyond speaking distance.
Henchard had saved Lucetta, and to provoke a possible exhibition of her deeper affection for himself was as ungenerous as it was unwise.
The immediate subject of their talk being exhausted she felt more embarrassed at sitting thus beside her past lover; but soon the two figures of the others were visible at the entrance to the town.
I don’t want to make you wretched; and to marry me just now would do that as nothing else could—it is but too plain.
Therefore I agree to an indefinite engagement—to put off all thought of marriage for a year or two.” “But—but—can I do nothing of a different kind?” said Lucetta.
This may be got out of him in one way—that you would let it be known to him that you are my intended—that we are to be quietly married in the next fortnight.—Now stop, you haven’t heard all!
We were married this week at Port-Bredy.
“My good—what, married him whilst—bound to marry me?” “It was like this,” she explained, with tears in her eyes and quavers in her voice; “don’t—don’t be cruel!
I loved him so much, and I thought you might tell him of the past—and that grieved me!
One word to this bran-new husband of how you courted me, and your precious happiness is blown to atoms!” “Michael—pity me, and be generous!” “You don’t deserve pity!
“That is, broken the news of our marriage to my dear Elizabeth-Jane.” “Ah, and you have not?” he said thoughtfully.
Somebody must be married; or else they are practising for Christmas.” Lucetta uttered a vague “Yes,” and seating herself by the other young woman looked musingly at her.
“You remember that trying case of conscience I told you of some time ago—about the first lover and the second lover?” She let out in jerky phrases a leading word or two of the story she had told.
“The two lovers—the old one and the new: how she wanted to marry the second, but felt she ought to marry the first; so that the good she would have done she did not, and the evil that she would not, that she did—exactly like the Apostle Paul.” “O no; she didn’t do evil exactly!” said Lucetta hastily.
“But you said that she—or as I may say _you_”—answered Elizabeth, dropping the mask, “were in honour and conscience bound to marry the first?” Lucetta’s blush at being seen through came and went again before she replied anxiously, “You will never breathe this, will you, Elizabeth-Jane?” “Certainly not, if you say not.
She is now dead, and the husband comes paying me addresses again, saying, ‘Now we’ll complete our purposes.’ But, Elizabeth-Jane, all this amounts to a new courtship of me by him; I was absolved from all vows by the return of the other woman.” “Have you not lately renewed your promise?” said the younger with quiet surmise.
“He turned out to be a man I should be afraid to marry,” she pleaded.
“You ought to marry Mr. Henchard or nobody—certainly not another man!” she went on with a quivering lip in whose movement two passions shared.
“Why, you _have_ married him!” cried the latter, jumping up with pleasure after a glance at Lucetta’s fingers.
You are the woman he will adore, and we shall all three be happy together now!” “O, my Elizabeth-Jane!” cried Lucetta distressfully.
“’Tis somebody else that I have married!
I was so desperate—so afraid of being forced to anything else—so afraid of revelations that would quench his love for me, that I resolved to do it offhand, come what might, and purchase a week of happiness at any cost!” “You—have—married Mr. Farfrae!” cried Elizabeth-Jane, in Nathan tones Lucetta bowed.
Apart from her estimate of the propriety of Lucetta’s conduct, Farfrae had been so nearly her avowed lover that she felt she could not abide there.
By this time the marriage that had taken place was known throughout Casterbridge; had been discussed noisily on kerbstones, confidentially behind counters, and jovially at the Three Mariners.
For to this pair of bridges gravitated all the failures of the town; those who had failed in business, in love, in sobriety, in crime.
There and thus they would muse; if their grief were the grief of oppression they would wish themselves kings; if their grief were poverty, wish themselves millionaires; if sin, they would wish they were saints or angels; if despised love, that they were some much-courted Adonis of county fame.
Surely he’ll buy my body and soul likewise!” “There’s no saying he won’t, if you be willing to sell.” And having planted these wounds in the heart of his once imperious master Jopp went on his way; while Henchard stared and stared into the racing river till the bridge seemed moving backward with him.
I want you fellows of the choir to strike up a tune; and what with that and this brew of Stannidge’s, I am in hopes of getting altogether out of my minor key.” “With all my heart,” said the first fiddle.
Henchard saw this, and concealed his feelings under a cover of stolidity, fortifying his heart by drinking more freely at the Three Mariners every evening.
Elizabeth felt quite sick at heart on thinking of what this _might_ have meant.
Lucetta, light as a sylph, ran forward and seized his hands, whereupon Farfrae duly kissed her.
It is more like old-fashioned rivalry in love than just a bit of rivalry in trade.” Lucetta had grown somewhat wan.
Farfrae was Mayor—the two-hundredth odd of a series forming an elective dynasty dating back to the days of Charles I—and the fair Lucetta was the courted of the town....
“Luckily she married, and married well,” said Henchard.
“As I didn’t marry her, and another man did, I can scarcely do that in fairness to her.” “Tr-rue, tr-rue,” said Farfrae.
“But why didn’t you marry her when your wife Susan died?” Farfrae asked this and the other questions in the comfortably indifferent tone of one whom the matter very remotely concerned.
“In spite of all her protestations, when I came forward to do so, as in generosity bound, she was not the woman for me.” “She had already married another—maybe?” Henchard seemed to think it would be sailing too near the wind to descend further into particulars, and he answered “Yes.” “The young lady must have had a heart that bore transplanting very readily!” “She had, she had,” said Henchard emphatically.
Had she confessed all to Donald in their early acquaintance he might possibly have got over it, and married her just the same—unlikely as it had once seemed; but for her or any one else to tell him now would be fatal.
I may tell more about her some day.” Finding this, she was much perplexed as to Henchard’s motives in opening the matter at all; for in such cases we attribute to an enemy a power of consistent action which we never find in ourselves or in our friends; and forget that abortive efforts from want of heart are as possible to revenge as to generosity.
To heighten her natural attraction had hitherto been the unvarying endeavour of her adult life, and one in which she was no novice.
Her figure in the midst of the huge enclosure, the unusual plainness of her dress, her attitude of hope and appeal, so strongly revived in his soul the memory of another ill-used woman who had stood there and thus in bygone days, and had now passed away into her rest, that he was unmanned, and his heart smote him for having attempted reprisals on one of a sex so weak.
He had married money, but nothing more.
But, between you and me, Lucetta, he is sure to find out something of the matter, sooner or later.” “Ah!” she said with eager tremulousness; “but not till I have proved myself a faithful and deserving wife to him, and then he may forgive me everything!” Henchard silently looked at her: he almost envied Farfrae such love as that, even now.
“It is the passion of love.
To think that a woman should love one man so well, and hate another so unmercifully.” “Who’s the object of your meditation, sir?” “One that stands high in this town.
“Ah, I saved her from a real bad marriage, and she’s never been the one to thank me.” “I say, what a good foundation for a skimmity-ride,” said Nance.
“A good laugh warms my heart more than a cordial, and that’s the truth on’t.” Jopp gathered up the letters, and it being now somewhat late he did not attempt to call at Farfrae’s with them that night.
It will be worth seeing!” She could do nothing to elucidate this, and decked herself out with a heavy heart.
“Do you say the man is an acquaintance of Mr. Farfrae’s?” observed Mrs. Bath, the physician’s wife, a new-comer to the town through her recent marriage with the doctor.
Hence the anxiety to keep him from annoyance showed not quite the ardour that would have animated it in former days.
“God is my witness that no man ever loved another as I did thee at one time.... And now—though I came here to kill ’ee, I cannot hurt thee!
The scenes of his first acquaintance with Farfrae rushed back upon him—that time when the curious mixture of romance and thrift in the young man’s composition so commanded his heart that Farfrae could play upon him as on an instrument.
She was leaning back in the chair, in a more hopeful mood than she had enjoyed since her marriage.
He is just coming home—and it will break his heart—he will never love me any more—and O, it will kill me—kill me!” Elizabeth-Jane was frantic now.
don’t mistrust me—I am a wretched man; but my heart is true to you still!” Farfrae, however, did distrust him utterly.
There had been affection in it, and above all things what he desired now was affection from anything that was good and pure.
She was not his own, yet, for the first time, he had a faint dream that he might get to like her as his own,—if she would only continue to love him.
But in respect of her subsequent conduct—her motive in coming to Casterbridge to unite herself with Henchard—her assumed justification in abandoning him when she discovered reasons for fearing him (though in truth her inconsequent passion for another man at first sight had most to do with that abandonment)—her method of reconciling to her conscience a marriage with the second when she was in a measure committed to the first: to what extent she spoke of these things remained Farfrae’s secret alone.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>She could write her own name, and no more.” “Well, it was not in my heart to undeceive her when the deed was done,” said the sailor of former days.
Towards the young woman herself his affection grew more jealously strong with each new hazard to which his claim to her was exposed.
Possibly he had spoken to nobody on the coach, but buried his grief in his own heart.
Newson’s affection cooled by years, could not equal his who had been constantly in her presence.
“At this moment her heart is as warm towards me as mine is towards her, she would live with me here in this humble cottage for the asking!
He was a wanderer and a stranger, almost an alien; he had not seen his daughter for several years; his affection for her could not in the nature of things be keen; other interests would probably soon obscure his recollections of her, and prevent any such renewal of inquiry into the past as would lead to a discovery that she was still a creature of the present.
Furthermore he pleaded within himself that no Newson could love her as he loved her, or would tend her to his life’s extremity as he was prepared to do cheerfully.
Sometimes it occurred to him that when she sat with him in the evening after those invigorating walks she was civil rather than affectionate; and he was troubled; one more bitter regret being added to those he had already experienced at having, by his severe censorship, frozen up her precious affection when originally offered.
In the situation which their marriage would create he could see no _locus standi_ for himself at all.
He heard the young man address her as “Dearest Elizabeth-Jane,” and then kiss her, the girl looking quickly round to assure herself that nobody was near.
Both Farfrae and Elizabeth-Jane, unlike the rest of the people, must suppose Elizabeth to be his actual daughter, from his own assertion while he himself had the same belief; and though Farfrae must have so far forgiven him as to have no objection to own him as a father-in-law, intimate they could never be.
Had she lost her heart to any other man in the world than the one he had rivalled, cursed, wrestled with for life in days before his spirit was broken, Henchard would have said, “I am content.” But content with the prospect as now depicted was hard to acquire.
But what if he were mistaken in his views, and there were no necessity that his own absolute separation from her should be involved in the incident of her marriage?
But the lenses revealed that today the man was not Elizabeth-Jane’s lover.
Elizabeth’s strict nature would cause her for the first time to despise her stepfather, would root out his image as that of an arch-deceiver, and Newson would reign in her heart in his stead.
Henchard was not the man to stand the certainty of condemnation on a matter so near his heart.
“For I thought it probable—possible—that I might marry Mr. Farfrae some little time hence, and I did not know that you disapproved of the step!” “I approve of anything you desire to do, Izzy,” said Henchard huskily.
My presence might make things awkward in the future, and, in short, it is best that I go.” Nothing that her affection could urge would induce him to reconsider his determination; for she could not urge what she did not know—that when she should learn he was not related to her other than as a step-parent she would refrain from despising him, and that when she knew what he had done to keep her in ignorance she would refrain from hating him.
“Then,” she said at last, “you will not be able to come to my wedding; and that is not as it ought to be.” “I don’t want to see it—I don’t want to see it!” he exclaimed; adding more softly, “but think of me sometimes in your future life—you’ll do that, Izzy?—think of me when you are living as the wife of the richest, the foremost man in the town, and don’t let my sins, _when you know them all_, cause ’ee to quite forget that though I loved ’ee late I loved ’ee well.” “It is because of Donald!” she sobbed.
“I don’t forbid you to marry him,” said Henchard.
And Mr. Henchard will hear of it if he does not go far.” “He will go far—he’s bent upon getting out of sight and sound!” She walked beside her lover, and when they reached the Crossways, or Bow, turned with him into Corn Street instead of going straight on to her own door.
He kissed her again and again.
“And what I’ve been thinking is that the wedding may as well be kept under my own roof, the house being large, and you being in lodgings by yourself—so that a great deal of trouble and expense would be saved ye?—and ’tis a convenience when a couple’s married not to hae far to go to get home!” “With all my heart,” said Captain Newson; “since, as ye say, it can do no harm, now poor Henchard’s gone; though I wouldn’t have done it otherwise, or put myself in his way at all; for I’ve already in my lifetime been an intruder into his family quite as far as politeness can be expected to put up with.
His heart was so exacerbated at parting from the girl that he could not face an inn, or even a household of the most humble kind; and entering a field he lay down under a wheatrick, feeling no want of food.
He had been sorry for all this long ago; but his attempts to replace ambition by love had been as fully foiled as his ambition itself.
Out of this it happened that the centrifugal tendency imparted by weariness of the world was counteracted by the centripetal influence of his love for his stepdaughter.
“I trade up and down, ye know; though, what with this travelling without horses that’s getting so common, my work will soon be done.” “Anything moving in the old place, mid I ask?” “All the same as usual.” “I’ve heard that Mr. Farfrae, the late mayor, is thinking of getting married.
What if he had been mistaken in his views; if there had been no necessity that his own absolute separation from her he loved should be involved in these untoward incidents?
To make one more attempt to be near her: to go back, to see her, to plead his cause before her, to ask forgiveness for his fraud, to endeavour strenuously to hold his own in her love; it was worth the risk of repulse, ay, of life itself.
She had regretted his decision to be absent—his unanticipated presence would fill the little unsatisfied corner that would probably have place in her just heart without him.
He need have made no inquiries beforehand, for on drawing near Farfrae’s residence it was plain to the least observant that festivity prevailed within, and that Donald himself shared it, his voice being distinctly audible in the street, giving strong expression to a song of his dear native country that he loved so well as never to have revisited it.
His courage failed him; to enter footsore, laden, and poorly dressed into the midst of such resplendency was to bring needless humiliation upon her he loved, if not to court repulse from her husband.
That the quiet Elizabeth, who had long ago appraised life at a moderate value, and who knew in spite of her maidenhood that marriage was as a rule no dancing matter, should have had zest for this revelry surprised him still more.
With the progress of the dance the performers spread out somewhat, and then for the first time he caught a glimpse of the once despised daughter who had mastered him, and made his heart ache.
“I could have loved you always—I would have, gladly,” she said.
You persuaded me that my father was not my father—allowed me to live on in ignorance of the truth for years; and then when he, my warm-hearted real father, came to find me, cruelly sent him away with a wicked invention of my death, which nearly broke his heart.
O how can I love as I once did a man who has served us like this!” Henchard’s lips half parted to begin an explanation.
How should he, there and then, set before her with any effect the palliatives of his great faults—that he had himself been deceived in her identity at first, till informed by her mother’s letter that his own child had died; that, in the second accusation, his lie had been the last desperate throw of a gamester who loved her affection better than his own honour?
Newson had stayed in Casterbridge three days after the wedding party (whose gaiety, as might have been surmised, was of his making rather than of the married couple’s), and was stared at and honoured as became the returned Crusoe of the hour.
She went out, looked at the cage, buried the starved little singer, and from that hour her heart softened towards the self-alienated man.
As the lively and sparkling emotions of her early married life cohered into an equable serenity, the finer movements of her nature found scope in discovering to the narrow-lived ones around her the secret (as she had once learnt it) of making limited opportunities endurable; which she deemed to consist in the cunning enlargement, by a species of microscopic treatment, of those minute forms of satisfaction that offer themselves to everybody not in positive pain; which, thus handled, have much of the same inspiring effect upon life as wider interests cursorily embraced.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>But those who take an interest in this tale, will be glad to learn that the BROTHERS CHEERYBLE live; that their liberal charity, their singleness of heart, their noble nature, and their unbounded benevolence, are no creations of the Author’s brain; but are prompting every day (and oftenest by stealth) some munificent and generous deed in that town of which they are the pride and honour.” If I were to attempt to sum up the thousands of letters, from all sorts of people in all sorts of latitudes and climates, which this unlucky paragraph brought down upon me, I should get into an arithmetical difficulty from which I could not easily extricate myself.
CHAPTER 1 Introduces all the Rest There once lived, in a sequestered part of the county of Devonshire, one Mr. Godfrey Nickleby: a worthy gentleman, who, taking it into his head rather late in life that he must get married, and not being young enough or rich enough to aspire to the hand of a lady of fortune, had wedded an old flame out of mere attachment, who in her turn had taken him for the same reason.
Thus two people who cannot afford to play cards for money, sometimes sit down to a quiet game for love.
Mr. Nickleby’s income, at the period of his marriage, fluctuated between sixty and eighty pounds PER ANNUM.
Mr. Nickleby looked, and looked, till his eyes became sore as his heart, but no friend appeared; and when, growing tired of the search, he turned his eyes homeward, he saw very little there to relieve his weary vision.
‘And,’ reasoned Ralph with himself, ‘if no good came of my uncle’s money when he was alive, a great deal of good came of it after he was dead, inasmuch as my father has got it now, and is saving it up for me, which is a highly virtuous purpose; and, going back to the old gentleman, good DID come of it to him too, for he had the pleasure of thinking of it all his life long, and of being envied and courted by all his family besides.’ And Ralph always wound up these mental soliloquies by arriving at the conclusion, that there was nothing like money.
On the death of his father, Ralph Nickleby, who had been some time before placed in a mercantile house in London, applied himself passionately to his old pursuit of money-getting, in which he speedily became so buried and absorbed, that he quite forgot his brother for many years; and if, at times, a recollection of his old playfellow broke upon him through the haze in which he lived--for gold conjures up a mist about a man, more destructive of all his old senses and lulling to his feelings than the fumes of charcoal--it brought along with it a companion thought, that if they were intimate he would want to borrow money of him.
Mr. Nickleby shook his head, and motioning them all out of the room, embraced his wife and children, and having pressed them by turns to his languidly beating heart, sunk exhausted on his pillow.
Just at this moment, a waiter, feverish with agitation, tore into the room, and throwing the door open with a crash, shouted ‘Sir Matthew Pupker!’ The committee stood up and clapped their hands for joy, and while they were clapping them, in came Sir Matthew Pupker, attended by two live members of Parliament, one Irish and one Scotch, all smiling and bowing, and looking so pleasant that it seemed a perfect marvel how any man could have the heart to vote against them.
All this time, Sir Matthew Pupker and the two other members were relating to their separate circles what the intentions of government were, about taking up the bill; with a full account of what the government had said in a whisper the last time they dined with it, and how the government had been observed to wink when it said so; from which premises they were at no loss to draw the conclusion, that if the government had one object more at heart than another, that one object was the welfare and advantage of the United Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company.
I can understand a man’s dying of a broken neck, or suffering from a broken arm, or a broken head, or a broken leg, or a broken nose; but a broken heart!--nonsense, it’s the cant of the day.
If a man can’t pay his debts, he dies of a broken heart, and his widow’s a martyr.’ ‘Some people, I believe, have no hearts to break,’ observed Nicholas, quietly.
‘Nineteen, eh!’ said Ralph; ‘and what do you mean to do for your bread, sir?’ ‘Not to live upon my mother,’ replied Nicholas, his heart swelling as he spoke.
His figure was somewhat slight, but manly and well formed; and, apart from all the grace of youth and comeliness, there was an emanation from the warm young heart in his look and bearing which kept the old man down.
It galled Ralph to the heart’s core, and he hated Nicholas from that hour.
My brother was a thoughtless, inconsiderate man, Mrs. Nickleby, and nobody, I am sure, can have better reason to feel that, than you.’ This appeal set the widow upon thinking that perhaps she might have made a more successful venture with her one thousand pounds, and then she began to reflect what a comfortable sum it would have been just then; which dismal thoughts made her tears flow faster, and in the excess of these griefs she (being a well-meaning woman enough, but weak withal) fell first to deploring her hard fate, and then to remarking, with many sobs, that to be sure she had been a slave to poor Nicholas, and had often told him she might have married better (as indeed she had, very often), and that she never knew in his lifetime how the money went, but that if he had confided in her they might all have been better off that day; with other bitter recollections common to most married ladies, either during their coverture, or afterwards, or at both periods.
uncle, must we be separated so soon!’ ‘Don’t tease your uncle with questions when he is thinking only for our good, my love,’ said Mrs. Nickleby.
‘And who knows, but when he came to see me when I was settled (as he would of course), he might fall in love with Kate, who would be keeping my house, and--and marry her, eh!
To tell the truth, the good lady’s opinion had been not a little influenced by her brother-in-law’s appeal to her better understanding, and his implied compliment to her high deserts; and although she had dearly loved her husband, and still doted on her children, he had struck so successfully on one of those little jarring chords in the human heart (Ralph was well acquainted with its worst weaknesses, though he knew nothing of its best), that she had already begun seriously to consider herself the amiable and suffering victim of her late husband’s imprudence.
There, at the very core of London, in the heart of its business and animation, in the midst of a whirl of noise and motion: stemming as it were the giant currents of life that flow ceaselessly on from different quarters, and meet beneath its walls: stands Newgate; and in that crowded street on which it frowns so darkly--within a few feet of the squalid tottering houses--upon the very spot on which the vendors of soup and fish and damaged fruit are now plying their trades--scores of human beings, amidst a roar of sounds to which even the tumult of a great city is as nothing, four, six, or eight strong men at a time, have been hurried violently and swiftly from the world, when the scene has been rendered frightful with excess of human life; when curious eyes have glared from casement and house-top, and wall and pillar; and when, in the mass of white and upturned faces, the dying wretch, in his all-comprehensive look of agony, has met not one--not one--that bore the impress of pity or compassion.
This early trial of yours that is fit to make your little heart burst, and your very eyes come out of your head with crying, what is it?
Oh, I understand now.’ ‘You see I have married the mother,’ pursued Snawley; ‘it’s expensive keeping boys at home, and as she has a little money in her own right, I am afraid (women are so very foolish, Mr. Squeers) that she might be led to squander it on them, which would be their ruin, you know.’ ‘I see,’ returned Squeers, throwing himself back in his chair, and waving his hand.
Suppose we come to business?’ ‘With all my heart, sir,’ rejoined Squeers.
‘I can easily inquire.’ ‘Leave these papers with my clerk, then,’ said Ralph, producing a small parcel, ‘and tell him to wait till I come home.’ Nicholas cheerfully undertook the errand, and bidding his worthy uncle an affectionate farewell, which that warm-hearted old gentleman acknowledged by a growl, hastened away to execute his commission.
A hundred affectionate contests on such points as these, took place on the sad night which preceded his departure; and, as the termination of every angerless dispute brought them nearer and nearer to the close of their slight preparations, Kate grew busier and busier, and wept more silently.
‘If you ever have an opportunity of showing Kate some little kindness,’ said Nicholas, presenting his hand, ‘I think you will.’ ‘Depend upon that,’ said the good-natured miniature painter; ‘and God bless you, Mr. Nickleby; and I wish you well.’ It was very little that Nicholas knew of the world, but he guessed enough about its ways to think, that if he gave Miss La Creevy one little kiss, perhaps she might not be the less kindly disposed towards those he was leaving behind.
By the time he had found a man to carry his box it was only seven o’clock, so he walked slowly on, a little in advance of the porter, and very probably with not half as light a heart in his breast as the man had, although he had no waistcoat to cover it with, and had evidently, from the appearance of his other garments, been spending the night in a stable, and taking his breakfast at a pump.
Bless you, love, and goodbye!
Quite ready, sir!’ With these hasty adieux, Nicholas mounted nimbly to his seat, and waved his hand as gallantly as if his heart went with it.
‘They are all under the same parental and affectionate treatment.
‘The heart of this fair girl bounded with joy and gladness.
Devoted attachment to her sisters, and a fervent love of all beautiful things in nature, were its pure affections.
Alice, dear Alice; what living thing within the sphere of her gentle witchery, could fail to love her!
Even a monk might have loved them as choice masterpieces of his Maker’s hand.
‘“You know how light of heart sweet Alice is,” replied the eldest sister, passing her fingers through the tresses of the smiling girl.
‘“Our dear mother,” faltered the fair Alice, “was living when these long tasks began, and bade us, when she should be no more, ply them in all discretion and cheerfulness, in our leisure hours; she said that if in harmless mirth and maidenly pursuits we passed those hours together, they would prove the happiest and most peaceful of our lives, and that if, in later times, we went forth into the world, and mingled with its cares and trials--if, allured by its temptations and dazzled by its glitter, we ever forgot that love and duty which should bind, in holy ties, the children of one loved parent--a glance at the old work of our common girlhood would awaken good thoughts of bygone days, and soften our hearts to affection and love.” ‘“Alice speaks truly, father,” said the elder sister, somewhat proudly.
‘“Take comfort, Alice,” said the eldest, kissing her fair forehead.
“Stay, and hear from me what these recollections are, which you would cherish above eternity, and awaken--if in mercy they slumbered--by means of idle toys.
‘“The policy of courts,” he continued, turning to the two other sisters, “drew ye from your peaceful home to scenes of revelry and splendour.
‘And could they, remembering how her young heart had sickened at the thought of cloistered walls, look upon her grave, in garbs which would chill the very ashes within it?
These were fitted into a large window until that time bare of ornament; and when the sun shone brightly, as she had so well loved to see it, the familiar patterns were reflected in their original colours, and throwing a stream of brilliant light upon the pavement, fell warmly on the name of Alice.
‘Do you think the sisters who loved her so well, would have grieved the less if her life had been one of gloom and sadness?
If anything could soothe the first sharp pain of a heavy loss, it would be--with me--the reflection, that those I mourned, by being innocently happy here, and loving all about them, had prepared themselves for a purer and happier world.
“We will demand her in marriage of her father, ere the sun goes down tomorrow.
If the daughter of the Baron Von Swillenhausen had pleaded a preoccupied heart, or fallen at her father’s feet and corned them in salt tears, or only fainted away, and complimented the old gentleman in frantic ejaculations, the odds are a hundred to one but Swillenhausen Castle would have been turned out at window, or rather the baron turned out at window, and the castle demolished.
The damsel held her peace, however, when an early messenger bore the request of Von Koeldwethout next morning, and modestly retired to her chamber, from the casement of which she watched the coming of the suitor and his retinue.
‘“My love,” said the baron.
‘“Disband them, love,” murmured the baroness.
‘“To please me, love,” replied the baroness.
‘It is not for me to say by what means, or by what degrees, some wives manage to keep down some husbands as they do, although I may have my private opinion on the subject, and may think that no Member of Parliament ought to be married, inasmuch as three married members out of every four, must vote according to their wives’ consciences (if there be such things), and not according to their own.
And if the Baron of Grogzwig, a little hurt and irritated at this, took heart, and ventured to suggest that his wife was at least no worse off than the wives of other barons, the Baroness Von Swillenhausen begged all persons to take notice, that nobody but she, sympathised with her dear daughter’s sufferings; upon which, her relations and friends remarked, that to be sure she did cry a great deal more than her son-in-law, and that if there were a hard-hearted brute alive, it was that Baron of Grogzwig.
His great distance from home and the impossibility of reaching it, except on foot, should he feel ever so anxious to return, presented itself to him in most alarming colours; and as he looked up at the dreary house and dark windows, and upon the wild country round, covered with snow, he felt a depression of heart and spirit which he had never experienced before.
They had not been in this apartment a couple of minutes, when a female bounced into the room, and, seizing Mr. Squeers by the throat, gave him two loud kisses: one close after the other, like a postman’s knock.
‘Quite well, my love,’ replied Squeers.
I’d beat it out of him; and I told you that, six months ago.’ ‘So you did, my love,’ rejoined Squeers.
The look was a very painful one, and went to Nicholas’s heart at once; for it told a long and very sad history.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>‘Come in, my love,’ said Squeers.
With every kindly sympathy and affection blasted in its birth, with every young and healthy feeling flogged and starved down, with every revengeful passion that can fester in swollen hearts, eating its evil way to their core in silence, what an incipient Hell was breeding here!
A few minutes having elapsed, during which Mr. Squeers looked very profound, as if he had a perfect apprehension of what was inside all the books, and could say every word of their contents by heart if he only chose to take the trouble, that gentleman called up the first class.
An unhealthy-looking boy, with warts all over his hands, stepped from his place to the master’s desk, and raised his eyes imploringly to Squeers’s face; his own, quite white from the rapid beating of his heart.
Hopes, above all, that he will study in everything to please Mr. and Mrs Squeers, and look upon them as his only friends; and that he will love Master Squeers; and not object to sleeping five in a bed, which no Christian should.
Very affecting indeed.’ It was affecting in one sense, for Graymarsh’s maternal aunt was strongly supposed, by her more intimate friends, to be no other than his maternal parent; Squeers, however, without alluding to this part of the story (which would have sounded immoral before boys), proceeded with the business by calling out ‘Mobbs,’ whereupon another boy rose, and Graymarsh resumed his seat.
‘My heart will break.
Do you remember the boy that died here?’ ‘I was not here, you know,’ said Nicholas gently; ‘but what of him?’ ‘Why,’ replied the youth, drawing closer to his questioner’s side, ‘I was with him at night, and when it was all silent he cried no more for friends he wished to come and sit with him, but began to see faces round his bed that came from home; he said they smiled, and talked to him; and he died at last lifting his head to kiss them.
It was with a heavy heart that Nicholas soon afterwards--no, not retired; there was no retirement there--followed--to his dirty and crowded dormitory.
‘He’s nothing of the kind,’ said Squeers, in answer to the above remark, ‘for his father was married to his mother years before he was born, and she is alive now.
‘He said about an hour,’ replied Nicholas--politely of course, but without any indication of being stricken to the heart by Miss Squeers’s charms.
It might be, to give Nicholas to understand that her heart was soft, and that the pen was wanted to match.
In fact, Miss Squeers was in love with Nicholas Nickleby.
Miss Squeers and the miller’s daughter, being fast friends, had covenanted together some two years before, according to a custom prevalent among young ladies, that whoever was first engaged to be married, should straightway confide the mighty secret to the bosom of the other, before communicating it to any living soul, and bespeak her as bridesmaid without loss of time; in fulfilment of which pledge the miller’s daughter, when her engagement was formed, came out express, at eleven o’clock at night as the corn-factor’s son made an offer of his hand and heart at twenty-five minutes past ten by the Dutch clock in the kitchen, and rushed into Miss Squeers’s bedroom with the gratifying intelligence.
Then, she dilated on the fearful hardship of having a father and mother strenuously opposed to her intended husband; on which unhappy circumstance she dwelt at great length; for the friend’s father and mother were quite agreeable to her being married, and the whole courtship was in consequence as flat and common-place an affair as it was possible to imagine.
To be sure Miss Squeers was in a desperate flutter as the time approached, and to be sure she was dressed out to the best advantage: with her hair--it had more than a tinge of red, and she wore it in a crop--curled in five distinct rows, up to the very top of her head, and arranged dexterously over the doubtful eye; to say nothing of the blue sash which floated down her back, or the worked apron or the long gloves, or the green gauze scarf worn over one shoulder and under the other; or any of the numerous devices which were to be as so many arrows to the heart of Nicholas.
You may go on just as you would if you were alone.’ ‘’Tilda,’ said Miss Squeers, colouring up to the top row of curls, ‘I am ashamed of you;’ and here the two friends burst into a variety of giggles, and glanced from time to time, over the tops of their pocket-handkerchiefs, at Nicholas, who from a state of unmixed astonishment, gradually fell into one of irrepressible laughter--occasioned, partly by the bare notion of his being in love with Miss Squeers, and partly by the preposterous appearance and behaviour of the two girls.
‘I don’t know whether your perceptions are quite keen enough, Mr Browdie, to enable you to understand that your remarks are offensive,’ said Nicholas in a towering passion, ‘but if they are, have the goodness to--’ ‘If you say another word, John,’ shrieked Miss Price, stopping her admirer’s mouth as he was about to interrupt, ‘only half a word, I’ll never forgive you, or speak to you again.’ ‘Weel, my lass, I dean’t care aboot ‘un,’ said the corn-factor, bestowing a hearty kiss on Miss Matilda; ‘let ‘un gang on, let ‘un gang on.’ It now became Miss Squeers’s turn to intercede with Nicholas, which she did with many symptoms of alarm and horror; the effect of the double intercession was, that he and John Browdie shook hands across the table with much gravity; and such was the imposing nature of the ceremonial, that Miss Squeers was overcome and shed tears.
‘Only a dozen and eight, love,’ replied Miss Price, affecting to take the question in a literal sense.
So the means employed, and the end produced, were alike the most natural in the world; for young ladies will look forward to being married, and will jostle each other in the race to the altar, and will avail themselves of all opportunities of displaying their own attractions to the best advantage, down to the very end of time, as they have done from its beginning.
There’s no love lost between us, I assure you,’ said Miss Price, tying her bonnet strings with a jerk.
‘Character portraits, oh yes--they’re not real military men, you know.’ ‘No!’ ‘Bless your heart, of course not; only clerks and that, who hire a uniform coat to be painted in, and send it here in a carpet bag.
But, now, mightn’t he, without feeling it himself, make you and your mama some nice little allowance that would keep you both comfortable until you were well married, and be a little fortune to her afterwards?
‘You were talking so loud, that I was unable to make you hear.’ When the man of business had a more than commonly vicious snarl lurking at his heart, he had a trick of almost concealing his eyes under their thick and protruding brows, for an instant, and then displaying them in their full keenness.
‘Kate, my love, let your uncle proceed,’ said Mrs. Nickleby.
‘Your uncle’s time is very valuable, my dear; and however desirous you may be--and naturally desirous, as I am sure any affectionate relations who have seen so little of your uncle as we have, must naturally be to protract the pleasure of having him among us, still, we are bound not to be selfish, but to take into consideration the important nature of his occupations in the city.’ ‘I am very much obliged to you, ma’am,’ said Ralph with a scarcely perceptible sneer.
And yet, she had loved him dearly for many years, and had no greater share of selfishness than is the usual lot of mortals.
‘I recollect when your poor papa and I came to town after we were married, that a young lady brought me home a chip cottage-bonnet, with white and green trimming, and green persian lining, in her own carriage, which drove up to the door full gallop;--at least, I am not quite certain whether it was her own carriage or a hackney chariot, but I remember very well that the horse dropped down dead as he was turning round, and that your poor papa said he hadn’t had any corn for a fortnight.’ This anecdote, so strikingly illustrative of the opulence of milliners, was not received with any great demonstration of feeling, inasmuch as Kate hung down her head while it was relating, and Ralph manifested very intelligible symptoms of extreme impatience.
If your daughter is disposed to try after the situation, I’ll take her there directly.’ ‘Have you nothing to say to your uncle, my love?’ inquired Mrs. Nickleby.
But, it would have been a stranger contrast still, to have read the hearts that were beating side by side; to have laid bare the gentle innocence of the one, and the rugged villainy of the other; to have hung upon the guileless thoughts of the affectionate girl, and been amazed that, among all the wily plots and calculations of the old man, there should not be one word or figure denoting thought of death or of the grave.
But so it was; and stranger still--though this is a thing of every day--the warm young heart palpitated with a thousand anxieties and apprehensions, while that of the old worldly man lay rusting in its cell, beating only as a piece of cunning mechanism, and yielding no one throb of hope, or fear, or love, or care, for any living thing.
He had married on his whiskers; upon which property he had previously subsisted, in a genteel manner, for some years; and which he had recently improved, after patient cultivation by the addition of a moustache, which promised to secure him an easy independence: his share in the labours of the business being at present confined to spending the money, and occasionally, when that ran short, driving to Mr. Ralph Nickleby to procure discount--at a percentage--for the customers’ bills.
‘My life,’ said Mr. Mantalini, ‘what a demd devil of a time you have been!’ ‘I didn’t even know Mr. Nickleby was here, my love,’ said Madame Mantalini.
‘My dear,’ said Madame, ‘that is entirely your fault.’ ‘My fault, my heart’s joy?’ ‘Certainly,’ returned the lady; ‘what can you expect, dearest, if you will not correct the man?’ ‘Correct the man, my soul’s delight!’ ‘Yes; I am sure he wants speaking to, badly enough,’ said Madame, pouting.
‘Then do not vex itself,’ said Mr. Mantalini; ‘he shall be horse-whipped till he cries out demnebly.’ With this promise Mr. Mantalini kissed Madame Mantalini, and, after that performance, Madame Mantalini pulled Mr. Mantalini playfully by the ear: which done, they descended to business.
‘Do you wish to break my heart?’ ‘Not for twenty thousand hemispheres populated with--with--with little ballet-dancers,’ replied Mantalini in a poetical strain.
‘I hope so,’ returned Madame Mantalini; ‘our hours are from nine to nine, with extra work when we’re very full of business, for which I allow payment as overtime.’ Kate bowed her head, to intimate that she heard, and was satisfied.
It was with many gloomy forebodings and misgivings, therefore, that she looked forward, with a heavy heart, to the opening of her new career.
By the time Kate reached home, the good lady had called to mind two authentic cases of milliners who had been possessed of considerable property, though whether they had acquired it all in business, or had had a capital to start with, or had been lucky and married to advantage, she could not exactly remember.
‘I shall see you very often, and come and hear how you get on; and if, in all London, or all the wide world besides, there is no other heart that takes an interest in your welfare, there will be one little lonely woman that prays for it night and day.’ With this, the poor soul, who had a heart big enough for Gog, the guardian genius of London, and enough to spare for Magog to boot, after making a great many extraordinary faces which would have secured her an ample fortune, could she have transferred them to ivory or canvas, sat down in a corner, and had what she termed ‘a real good cry.’ But no crying, or talking, or hoping, or fearing, could keep off the dreaded Saturday afternoon, or Newman Noggs either; who, punctual to his time, limped up to the door, and breathed a whiff of cordial gin through the keyhole, exactly as such of the church clocks in the neighbourhood as agreed among themselves about the time, struck five.
‘Well, then, my love, I wish you would keep your foolish fancy to yourself, and not wake up MY foolish fancy to keep it company,’ retorted Mrs. Nickleby.
What is the reason that men fall in love with me, whether I like it or not, and desert their chosen intendeds for my sake?’ ‘Because they can’t help it, miss,’ replied the girl; ‘the reason’s plain.’ (If Miss Squeers were the reason, it was very plain.)
‘Tilda Price has faults--many faults--but I wish her well, and above all I wish her married; for I think it highly desirable--most desirable from the very nature of her failings--that she should be married as soon as possible.
Miss Squeers knew as well in her heart of hearts that what the miserable serving-girl had said was sheer, coarse, lying flattery, as did the girl herself; yet the mere opportunity of venting a little ill-nature against the offending Miss Price, and affecting to compassionate her weaknesses and foibles, though only in the presence of a solitary dependant, was almost as great a relief to her spleen as if the whole had been gospel truth.
‘Go on.’ ‘After a great deal of wrangling, and saying we would never see each other any more,’ continued Miss Price, ‘we made it up, and this morning John went and wrote our names down to be put up, for the first time, next Sunday, so we shall be married in three weeks, and I give you notice to get your frock made.’ There was mingled gall and honey in this intelligence.
The prospect of the friend’s being married so soon was the gall, and the certainty of her not entertaining serious designs upon Nicholas was the honey.
Upon the whole, the sweet greatly preponderated over the bitter, so Miss Squeers said she would get the frock made, and that she hoped ‘Tilda might be happy, though at the same time she didn’t know, and would not have her build too much upon it, for men were strange creatures, and a great many married women were very miserable, and wished themselves single again with all their hearts; to which condolences Miss Squeers added others equally calculated to raise her friend’s spirits and promote her cheerfulness of mind.
‘I fear there is something more,’ stammered Nicholas with a half-smile, and looking towards Miss Squeers, ‘it is a most awkward thing to say--but--the very mention of such a supposition makes one look like a puppy--still--may I ask if that lady supposes that I entertain any--in short, does she think that I am in love with her?’ ‘Delightful embarrassment,’ thought Miss Squeers, ‘I have brought him to it, at last.
I have not one thought, wish, or hope, connected with her, unless it be--and I say this, not to hurt her feelings, but to impress her with the real state of my own--unless it be the one object, dear to my heart as life itself, of being one day able to turn my back upon this accursed place, never to set foot in it again, or think of it--even think of it--but with loathing and disgust.’ With this particularly plain and straightforward declaration, which he made with all the vehemence that his indignant and excited feelings could bring to bear upon it, Nicholas waiting to hear no more, retreated.
refused by a teacher, picked up by advertisement, at an annual salary of five pounds payable at indefinite periods, and ‘found’ in food and lodging like the very boys themselves; and this too in the presence of a little chit of a miller’s daughter of eighteen, who was going to be married, in three weeks’ time, to a man who had gone down on his very knees to ask her.
There was another and deeper system of annoyance which made his heart sink, and nearly drove him wild, by its injustice and cruelty.
He had arranged a few regular lessons for the boys; and one night, as he paced up and down the dismal schoolroom, his swollen heart almost bursting to think that his protection and countenance should have increased the misery of the wretched being whose peculiar destitution had awakened his pity, he paused mechanically in a dark corner where sat the object of his thoughts.
Say I should be sure to find you.’ ‘You would,’ replied Nicholas, with the same humane intention, ‘and I would help and aid you, and not bring fresh sorrow on you as I have done here.’ The boy caught both the young man’s hands passionately in his, and, hugging them to his breast, uttered a few broken sounds which were unintelligible.
Mr. Squeers made a plunge into the crowd, and at one dive, caught a very little boy, habited still in his night-gear, and the perplexed expression of whose countenance, as he was brought forward, seemed to intimate that he was as yet uncertain whether he was about to be punished or rewarded for the suggestion.
There was little, perhaps, to choose between this fate and a return to the tender mercies of the Yorkshire school; but the unhappy being had established a hold upon his sympathy and compassion, which made his heart ache at the prospect of the suffering he was destined to undergo.
The boys--with the exception of Master Squeers, who, coming to his father’s assistance, harassed the enemy in the rear--moved not, hand or foot; but Mrs. Squeers, with many shrieks for aid, hung on to the tail of her partner’s coat, and endeavoured to drag him from his infuriated adversary; while Miss Squeers, who had been peeping through the keyhole in expectation of a very different scene, darted in at the very beginning of the attack, and after launching a shower of inkstands at the usher’s head, beat Nicholas to her heart’s content; animating herself, at every blow, with the recollection of his having refused her proffered love, and thus imparting additional strength to an arm which (as she took after her mother in this respect) was, at no time, one of the weakest.
When he had cooled sufficiently to be enabled to give his present circumstances some little reflection, they did not appear in a very encouraging light; he had only four shillings and a few pence in his pocket, and was something more than two hundred and fifty miles from London, whither he resolved to direct his steps, that he might ascertain, among other things, what account of the morning’s proceedings Mr. Squeers transmitted to his most affectionate uncle.
‘Tak’ that bit o’ timber to help thee on wi’, mun,’ he added, pressing his stick on Nicholas, and giving his hand another squeeze; ‘keep a good heart, and bless thee.
To these were added a newly-married couple, who had visited Mr. and Mrs. Kenwigs in their courtship; and a sister of Mrs. Kenwigs’s, who was quite a beauty; besides whom, there was another young man, supposed to entertain honourable designs upon the lady last mentioned; and Mr. Noggs, who was a genteel person to ask, because he had been a gentleman once.
Would you begin without my uncle?’ ‘I forgot the collector,’ said Kenwigs; ‘oh no, that would never do.’ ‘He’s so particular,’ said Mrs. Kenwigs, turning to the other married lady, ‘that if we began without him, I should be out of his will for ever.’ ‘Dear!’ cried the married lady.
‘It goes to his heart, I believe, to be forced to cut the water off, when the people don’t pay,’ observed the bachelor friend, intending a joke.
Mrs. Kenwigs’s relation is a public man, and that he knows, George, and that he can bear; but putting Mrs. Kenwigs out of the question (if I COULD put Mrs. Kenwigs out of the question on such an occasion as this), I have the honour to be connected with the collector by marriage; and I cannot allow these remarks in my--’ Mr. Kenwigs was going to say ‘house,’ but he rounded the sentence with ‘apartments’.
‘Morleena, my dear, run down and let your uncle in, and kiss him directly you get the door open.
‘Oh, uncle, I am SO glad to see you,’ said Mrs. Kenwigs, kissing the collector affectionately on both cheeks.
Here was a collector of water-rates, without his book, without his pen and ink, without his double knock, without his intimidation, kissing--actually kissing--an agreeable female, and leaving taxes, summonses, notices that he had called, or announcements that he would never call again, for two quarters’ due, wholly out of the question.
“Mother,” she says, “I love him.”’ ‘“Adore him,” I said, uncle,’ interposed Mrs. Kenwigs.
‘“Mother,” she says, “I love him!” “What do I hear?” cries her mother; and instantly falls into strong conwulsions.’ A general exclamation of astonishment burst from the company.
‘After they were married, and there was no help for it, I was one of the first to say that Kenwigs must be taken notice of.
‘Morleena Kenwigs,’ cried her mother, at this crisis, much affected, ‘kiss your dear uncle!’ The young lady did as she was requested, and the three other little girls were successively hoisted up to the collector’s countenance, and subjected to the same process, which was afterwards repeated on them by the majority of those present.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>‘There, Kenwigs,’ said Mr. Lillyvick; ‘and let me tell you, at the same time, to show you how much out of temper I was, that if I had gone away without another word, it would have made no difference respecting that pound or two which I shall leave among your children when I die.’ ‘Morleena Kenwigs,’ cried her mother, in a torrent of affection.
‘Go down upon your knees to your dear uncle, and beg him to love you all his life through, for he’s more a angel than a man, and I’ve always said so.’ Miss Morleena approaching to do homage, in compliance with this injunction, was summarily caught up and kissed by Mr. Lillyvick; and thereupon Mrs. Kenwigs darted forward and kissed the collector, and an irrepressible murmur of applause broke from the company who had witnessed his magnanimity.
Reassured by this cheering intelligence, the company in some degree recovered from their fears, which had been productive of some most singular instances of a total want of presence of mind; thus, the bachelor friend had, for a long time, supported in his arms Mrs Kenwigs’s sister, instead of Mrs. Kenwigs; and the worthy Mr. Lillyvick had been actually seen, in the perturbation of his spirits, to kiss Miss Petowker several times, behind the room-door, as calmly as if nothing distressing were going forward.
I trust he may not turn out--well--no matter--my love to you, my dear, and long life to the baby!’ ‘Your namesake,’ said Mrs. Kenwigs, with a sweet smile.
My form dilates, my eye glistens, my breast heaves, my heart swells, my bosom burns, when I call to mind her greatness and her glory.’ ‘We wish, sir,’ remarked Mr. Pugstyles, calmly, ‘to ask you a few questions.’ ‘If you please, gentlemen; my time is yours--and my country’s--and my country’s--’ said Mr. Gregsbury.
‘MY DEAR MR PUGSTYLES, ‘Next to the welfare of our beloved island--this great and free and happy country, whose powers and resources are, I sincerely believe, illimitable--I value that noble independence which is an Englishman’s proudest boast, and which I fondly hope to bequeath to my children, untarnished and unsullied.
That Mrs. Kenwigs, impelled by gratitude, or ambition, or maternal pride, or maternal love, or all four powerful motives conjointly, had taken secret conference with Mr. Kenwigs, and had finally returned to propose that Mr. Johnson should instruct the four Miss Kenwigses in the French language as spoken by natives, at the weekly stipend of five shillings, current coin of the realm; being at the rate of one shilling per week, per each Miss Kenwigs, and one shilling over, until such time as the baby might be able to take it out in grammar.
Miss Petowker and Mrs. Kenwigs looked on, in silent admiration, broken only by the whispered assurances of the latter, that Morleena would have it all by heart in no time; and Mr. Lillyvick regarded the group with frowning and attentive eyes, lying in wait for something upon which he could open a fresh discussion on the language.
CHAPTER 17 Follows the Fortunes of Miss Nickleby It was with a heavy heart, and many sad forebodings which no effort could banish, that Kate Nickleby, on the morning appointed for the commencement of her engagement with Madame Mantalini, left the city when its clocks yet wanted a quarter of an hour of eight, and threaded her way alone, amid the noise and bustle of the streets, towards the west end of London.
There was not much to amuse in the room; of which the most attractive feature was, a half-length portrait in oil, of Mr. Mantalini, whom the artist had depicted scratching his head in an easy manner, and thus displaying to advantage a diamond ring, the gift of Madame Mantalini before her marriage.
‘Not so easy when one is eating a demnition egg,’ replied Mr. Mantalini; ‘for the yolk runs down the waistcoat, and yolk of egg does not match any waistcoat but a yellow waistcoat, demmit.’ ‘You were flirting with her during the whole night,’ said Madame Mantalini, apparently desirous to lead the conversation back to the point from which it had strayed.
‘She will not take poison, because she had a demd fine husband who might have married two countesses and a dowager--’ ‘Two countesses,’ interposed Madame.
‘Had I not seen, at a morning concert, the demdest little fascinator in all the world, and while that little fascinator is my wife, may not all the countesses and dowagers in England be--’ Mr. Mantalini did not finish the sentence, but he gave Madame Mantalini a very loud kiss, which Madame Mantalini returned; after which, there seemed to be some more kissing mixed up with the progress of the breakfast.
The demd old dowager will faint with grief and rage; the other two will say “He is married, he has made away with himself, it is a demd thing, it is all up!” They will hate each other demnebly, and wish you dead and buried.
‘Mantalini,’ cried Madame, ‘you forget yourself.’ ‘I don’t forget you, my soul, and never shall, and never can,’ said Mantalini, kissing his wife’s hand, and grimacing aside, to Miss Nickleby, who turned away.
In short, charity must have its romance, as the novelist or playwright must have his.
It must have its romance; and the less of real, hard, struggling work-a-day life there is in that romance, the better.
Well, all I can say is, Madame Mantalini, that I quite love the poor girl; and that if she was twice as indifferent-looking, and twice as awkward as she is, I should be only so much the more her friend, and that’s the truth of it.’ In fact, Miss Knag had conceived an incipient affection for Kate Nickleby, after witnessing her failure that morning, and this short conversation with her superior increased the favourable prepossession to a most surprising extent; which was the more remarkable, as when she first scanned that young lady’s face and figure, she had entertained certain inward misgivings that they would never agree.
‘But now,’ said Miss Knag, glancing at the reflection of herself in a mirror at no great distance, ‘I love her--I quite love her--I declare I do!’ Of such a highly disinterested quality was this devoted friendship, and so superior was it to the little weaknesses of flattery or ill-nature, that the kind-hearted Miss Knag candidly informed Kate Nickleby, next day, that she saw she would never do for the business, but that she need not give herself the slightest uneasiness on this account, for that she (Miss Knag), by increased exertions on her own part, would keep her as much as possible in the background, and that all she would have to do, would be to remain perfectly quiet before company, and to shrink from attracting notice by every means in her power.
‘Bless you!’ said Miss Knag, bestowing a kiss upon Kate at the conclusion of the second day’s work, ‘how very awkward you have been all day.’ ‘I fear your kind and open communication, which has rendered me more painfully conscious of my own defects, has not improved me,’ sighed Kate.
Which way are you walking, my love?’ ‘Towards the city,’ replied Kate.
You don’t know what it is to lose a husband, Miss Knag.’ As Miss Knag had never yet known what it was to gain one, it followed, very nearly as a matter of course, that she didn’t know what it was to lose one; so she said, in some haste, ‘No, indeed I don’t,’ and said it with an air intending to signify that she should like to catch herself marrying anybody--no, no, she knew better than that.
I recollect when she was only two years and a half old, that a gentleman who used to visit very much at our house--Mr Watkins, you know, Kate, my dear, that your poor papa went bail for, who afterwards ran away to the United States, and sent us a pair of snow shoes, with such an affectionate letter that it made your poor dear father cry for a week.
‘Yes,’ continued Miss Knag, ‘and received great encouragement too, and confidently hoped to marry her.
He has a most romantic heart, Mrs. Nickleby, as indeed--hem--as indeed all our family have, and the disappointment was a dreadful blow.
It happened that an old lord of great family, who was going to marry a young lady of no family in particular, came with the young lady, and the young lady’s sister, to witness the ceremony of trying on two nuptial bonnets which had been ordered the day before, and Madame Mantalini announcing the fact, in a shrill treble, through the speaking-pipe, which communicated with the workroom, Miss Knag darted hastily upstairs with a bonnet in each hand, and presented herself in the show-room, in a charming state of palpitation, intended to demonstrate her enthusiasm in the cause.
Now, the old lord, who was a VERY old lord, said nothing, but mumbled and chuckled in a state of great delight, no less with the nuptial bonnets and their wearers, than with his own address in getting such a fine woman for his wife; and the young lady, who was a very lively young lady, seeing the old lord in this rapturous condition, chased the old lord behind a cheval-glass, and then and there kissed him, while Madame Mantalini and the other young lady looked, discreetly, another way.
But, pending the salutation, Miss Knag, who was tinged with curiosity, stepped accidentally behind the glass, and encountered the lively young lady’s eye just at the very moment when she kissed the old lord; upon which the young lady, in a pouting manner, murmured something about ‘an old thing,’ and ‘great impertinence,’ and finished by darting a look of displeasure at Miss Knag, and smiling contemptuously.
‘No, no, no,’ replied the old lord, ‘no, no, I’m going to be married, and lead a new life.
‘Your black silk frock will be quite dress enough, my dear, with that pretty little scarf, and a plain band in your hair, and a pair of black silk stock--Dear, dear,’ cried Mrs Nickleby, flying off at another angle, ‘if I had but those unfortunate amethysts of mine--you recollect them, Kate, my love--how they used to sparkle, you know--but your papa, your poor dear papa--ah!
And to do Mrs. Nickleby justice, she never had lost--and to do married ladies as a body justice, they seldom do lose--any occasion of inculcating similar golden percepts, whose only blemish is, the slight degree of vagueness and uncertainty in which they are usually enveloped.
Your uncle has taken a strong fancy to you, that’s quite clear; and if some extraordinary good fortune doesn’t come to you, after this, I shall be a little surprised, that’s all.’ With this she launched out into sundry anecdotes of young ladies, who had had thousand-pound notes given them in reticules, by eccentric uncles; and of young ladies who had accidentally met amiable gentlemen of enormous wealth at their uncles’ houses, and married them, after short but ardent courtships; and Kate, listening first in apathy, and afterwards in amusement, felt, as they walked home, something of her mother’s sanguine complexion gradually awakening in her own bosom, and began to think that her prospects might be brightening, and that better days might be dawning upon them.
In a gloomy corner, where, for years, had stood a silent dusty pile of merchandise, sheltering its colony of mice, and frowning, a dull and lifeless mass, upon the panelled room, save when, responding to the roll of heavy waggons in the street without, it quaked with sturdy tremblings and caused the bright eyes of its tiny citizens to grow brighter still with fear, and struck them motionless, with attentive ear and palpitating heart, until the alarm had passed away--in this dark corner, was arranged, with scrupulous care, all Kate’s little finery for the day; each article of dress partaking of that indescribable air of jauntiness and individuality which empty garments--whether by association, or that they become moulded, as it were, to the owner’s form--will take, in eyes accustomed to, or picturing, the wearer’s smartness.
‘Here is Miss Nickleby,’ observed Sir Mulberry, ‘wondering why the deuce somebody doesn’t make love to her.’ ‘No, indeed,’ said Kate, looking hastily up, ‘I--’ and then she stopped, feeling it would have been better to have said nothing at all.
Lounging on an ottoman close beside her, was Sir Mulberry Hawk, evidently the worse--if a man be a ruffian at heart, he is never the better--for wine.
‘Let me go, sir,’ she cried, her heart swelling with anger.
If I had wronged you in thought, or word, or deed, it would have been most cruel to me, and the memory of one you must have loved in some old time; but--’ ‘Only listen to me for a moment,’ interrupted Ralph, seriously alarmed by the violence of her emotions.
And how come you to have left Yorkshire?’ She stopped here; for there was so much heart in her altered tone and manner, that Nicholas was quite moved.
‘About this boy, love, in whose company they say you left?’ ‘The boy, a silly, helpless creature, from brutality and hard usage, is with me now,’ rejoined Nicholas.
Innocent as the young man was of all wrong, every artful insinuation stung, every well-considered sarcasm cut him to the quick; and when Ralph noted his pale face and quivering lip, he hugged himself to mark how well he had chosen the taunts best calculated to strike deep into a young and ardent spirit.
My dear brother, you will break my heart.
To have committed no fault, and yet to be so entirely alone in the world; to be separated from the only persons he loved, and to be proscribed like a criminal, when six months ago he had been surrounded by every comfort, and looked up to, as the chief hope of his family--this was hard to bear.
My heart is linked to yours.
Go along!’ The poppet, however, encouraged perhaps by the relenting tone of this reply, ventured to rebel, and, stealing into the room, made towards Madame Mantalini on tiptoe, blowing her a kiss as he came along.
There was, then, a great deal of whispering, during which Madame Mantalini appeared to make reference, more than once, to certain debts incurred by Mr. Mantalini previous to her coverture; and also to an unexpected outlay of money in payment of the aforesaid debts; and furthermore, to certain agreeable weaknesses on that gentleman’s part, such as gaming, wasting, idling, and a tendency to horse-flesh; each of which matters of accusation Mr. Mantalini disposed of, by one kiss or more, as its relative importance demanded.
In this softened frame of mind he did not oppose the capture of the knife--which, to tell the truth, he was rather glad to be rid of, as an inconvenient and dangerous article for a skirt pocket--and finally he suffered himself to be led away by his affectionate partner.
I don’t make it a reproach to you, my love; but still I will say, that if you had consulted your own mother--’ ‘Well, well, mama,’ said Kate, mildly: ‘what would you recommend now?’ ‘Recommend!’ cried Mrs. Nickleby, ‘isn’t it obvious, my dear, that of all occupations in this world for a young lady situated as you are, that of companion to some amiable lady is the very thing for which your education, and manners, and personal appearance, and everything else, exactly qualify you?
I know it began with a B, and ended with g, but whether it was Waters or--no, it couldn’t have been that, either; but whatever her name was, don’t you know that that young lady went as companion to a married lady who died soon afterwards, and that she married the husband, and had one of the finest little boys that the medical man had ever seen--all within eighteen months?’ Kate knew, perfectly well, that this torrent of favourable recollection was occasioned by some opening, real or imaginary, which her mother had discovered, in the companionship walk of life.
Mrs Nickleby had, that morning, had a yesterday’s newspaper of the very first respectability from the public-house where the porter came from; and in this yesterday’s newspaper was an advertisement, couched in the purest and most grammatical English, announcing that a married lady was in want of a genteel young person as companion, and that the married lady’s name and address were to be known, on application at a certain library at the west end of the town, therein mentioned.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>‘And I say,’ exclaimed Mrs. Nickleby, laying the paper down in triumph, ‘that if your uncle don’t object, it’s well worth the trial.’ Kate was too sick at heart, after the rough jostling she had already had with the world, and really cared too little at the moment what fate was reserved for her, to make any objection.
‘You are, my love, you know you are; one breath--’ said Mr. W., blowing an imaginary feather away.
It swells, expands, dilates--the blood fires, the pulse quickens, the excitement increases--Whew!”’ Here Mr. Wititterly, who, in the ardour of his description, had flourished his right hand to within something less than an inch of Mrs. Nickleby’s bonnet, drew it hastily back again, and blew his nose as fiercely as if it had been done by some violent machinery.
Bless my heart and body, can I ever forget the night you danced with the baronet’s nephew at the election ball, at Exeter!
Wititterly,’ said her husband, addressing himself to Mrs. Nickleby, ‘is sought after and courted by glittering crowds and brilliant circles.
She is excited by the opera, the drama, the fine arts, the--the--the--’ ‘The nobility, my love,’ interposed Mrs. Wititterly.
‘Why, who can help thinking so, Kate, my love?’ rejoined her mother.
Before reaching home, she had freed Mrs. Wititterly’s soul from all bodily restraint; married Kate with great splendour at St George’s, Hanover Square; and only left undecided the minor question, whether a splendid French-polished mahogany bedstead should be erected for herself in the two-pair back of the house in Cadogan Place, or in the three-pair front: between which apartments she could not quite balance the advantages, and therefore adjusted the question at last, by determining to leave it to the decision of her son-in-law.
And yet he hailed the morning on which he had resolved to quit London, with a light heart, and sprang from his bed with an elasticity of spirit which is happily the lot of young persons, or the world would never be stocked with old ones.
It was dull and bare to see, but it had light and life for him; for there was at least one heart within its old walls to which insult or dishonour would bring the same blood rushing, that flowed in his own veins.
Having pleaded ineffectually first for another half-mile, and afterwards for another quarter, Newman was fain to comply, and to shape his course towards Golden Square, after interchanging many hearty and affectionate farewells, and many times turning back to wave his hat to the two wayfarers when they had become mere specks in the distance.
Do you remember no woman, no kind woman, who hung over you once, and kissed your lips, and called you her child?’ ‘No,’ said the poor creature, shaking his head, ‘no, never.’ ‘Nor any house but that house in Yorkshire?’ ‘No,’ rejoined the youth, with a melancholy look; ‘a room--I remember I slept in a room, a large lonesome room at the top of a house, where there was a trap-door in the ceiling.
It was, by this time, within an hour of noon, and although a dense vapour still enveloped the city they had left, as if the very breath of its busy people hung over their schemes of gain and profit, and found greater attraction there than in the quiet region above, in the open country it was clear and fair.
It is more than probable, I think, that the gentleman may not relish my company; and although I am the dusty figure you see, I am too proud to thrust myself into his.’ ‘Lord love you,’ said the landlord, ‘it’s only Mr. Crummles; HE isn’t particular.’ ‘Is he not?’ asked Nicholas, on whose mind, to tell the truth, the prospect of the savoury pudding was making some impression.
‘Let them go,’ said Mr. Vincent Crummles, ‘and we’ll have it snugly and cosily together by the fire.’ Nicholas was not much disposed to sleep--being in truth too anxious--so, after a little demur, he accepted the offer, and having exchanged a shake of the hand with the young Crummleses, and the manager having on his part bestowed a most affectionate benediction on Smike, he sat himself down opposite to that gentleman by the fireside to assist in emptying the bowl, which soon afterwards appeared, steaming in a manner which was quite exhilarating to behold, and sending forth a most grateful and inviting fragrance.
It’ll look very well in the bills in separate lines--Real pump!--Splendid tubs!--Great attraction!
Acting upon the impulse of this passion, he (the savage) began to hit himself severe thumps in the chest, and to exhibit other indications of being desperately in love, which being rather a prosy proceeding, was very likely the cause of the maiden’s falling asleep; whether it was or no, asleep she did fall, sound as a church, on a sloping bank, and the savage perceiving it, leant his left ear on his left hand, and nodded sideways, to intimate to all whom it might concern that she WAS asleep, and no shamming.
Then the savage and the maiden danced violently together, and, finally, the savage dropped down on one knee, and the maiden stood on one leg upon his other knee; thus concluding the ballet, and leaving the spectators in a state of pleasing uncertainty, whether she would ultimately marry the savage, or return to her friends.
She may thank her stars she was born a manager’s daughter.’ ‘You seem to take it to heart,’ observed Nicholas, with a smile.
Making himself very amiable to the infant phenomenon, was an inebriated elderly gentleman in the last depths of shabbiness, who played the calm and virtuous old men; and paying especial court to Mrs Crummles was another elderly gentleman, a shade more respectable, who played the irascible old men--those funny fellows who have nephews in the army and perpetually run about with thick sticks to compel them to marry heiresses.
There was Mrs. Lenville, in a very limp bonnet and veil, decidedly in that way in which she would wish to be if she truly loved Mr. Lenville; there was Miss Gazingi, with an imitation ermine boa tied in a loose knot round her neck, flogging Mr. Crummles, junior, with both ends, in fun.
Mr. Lenville was a blooming warrior of most exquisite proportions; Mr. Crummles, his large face shaded by a profusion of black hair, a Highland outlaw of most majestic bearing; one of the old gentlemen a jailer, and the other a venerable patriarch; the comic countryman, a fighting-man of great valour, relieved by a touch of humour; each of the Master Crummleses a prince in his own right; and the low-spirited lover, a desponding captive.
There was an agreeable little surprise in the way of certain love passages between the desponding captive and Miss Snevellicci, and the comic fighting-man and Miss Bravassa; besides which, Mr. Lenville had several very tragic scenes in the dark, while on throat-cutting expeditions, which were all baffled by the skill and bravery of the comic fighting-man (who overheard whatever was said all through the piece) and the intrepidity of Miss Snevellicci, who adopted tights, and therein repaired to the prison of her captive lover, with a small basket of refreshments and a dark lantern.
At last, it came out that the patriarch was the man who had treated the bones of the outlaw’s father-in-law with so much disrespect, for which cause and reason the outlaw’s wife repaired to his castle to kill him, and so got into a dark room, where, after a good deal of groping in the dark, everybody got hold of everybody else, and took them for somebody besides, which occasioned a vast quantity of confusion, with some pistolling, loss of life, and torchlight; after which, the patriarch came forward, and observing, with a knowing look, that he knew all about his children now, and would tell them when they got inside, said that there could not be a more appropriate occasion for marrying the young people than that; and therefore he joined their hands, with the full consent of the indefatigable page, who (being the only other person surviving) pointed with his cap into the clouds, and his right hand to the ground; thereby invoking a blessing and giving the cue for the curtain to come down, which it did, amidst general applause.
You’ll have done it, and are sure to be up in the lover’s part, long before that time.’ ‘I don’t know about “long before,”’ replied Nicholas; ‘but BY that time I think I can undertake to be ready.’ ‘Very good,’ pursued Mr. Crummles, ‘then we’ll call that settled.
‘Among the patrons; and the fact is, that Snevellicci has had so many bespeaks in this place, that she wants an attraction.
We have reason to know that Miss Snevellicci IS the lady who was implicated in that mysterious and romantic affair, and whose conduct on that occasion did no less honour to her head and heart, than do her histrionic triumphs to her brilliant genius.’ A copious assortment of such paragraphs as these, with long bills of benefits all ending with ‘Come Early’, in large capitals, formed the principal contents of Miss Snevellicci’s scrapbook.
Now, Mrs. Curdle was supposed, by those who were best informed on such points, to possess quite the London taste in matters relating to literature and the drama; and as to Mr. Curdle, he had written a pamphlet of sixty-four pages, post octavo, on the character of the Nurse’s deceased husband in Romeo and Juliet, with an inquiry whether he really had been a ‘merry man’ in his lifetime, or whether it was merely his widow’s affectionate partiality that induced her so to report him.
‘The unities of the drama, before everything.’ ‘Might I ask you,’ said Nicholas, hesitating between the respect he ought to assume, and his love of the whimsical, ‘might I ask you what the unities are?’ Mr. Curdle coughed and considered.
I adored her from that moment!’ The arrival of the gifted subject of these remarks put an abrupt termination to Mr. Crummles’s eulogium.
You see that?’ ‘Oh yes,’ replied Nicholas: ‘it’s very true, no doubt.’ ‘The great reason for not being married,’ resumed Mr. Lillyvick, ‘is the expense; that’s what’s kept me off, or else--Lord!’ said Mr. Lillyvick, snapping his fingers, ‘I might have had fifty women.’ ‘Fine women?’ asked Nicholas.
‘Actresses, sir, always keep their maiden names--that’s the regular thing--but I’m going to marry her; and the day after tomorrow, too.’ ‘I congratulate you, sir,’ said Nicholas.
‘No,’ replied Mr. Lillyvick, shaking his head nervously: ‘no--of course not.’ ‘But how come you both here, if you’re going to be married, Mr Lillyvick?’ asked Nicholas.
‘If my niece and the children had known a word about it before I came away, they’d have gone into fits at my feet, and never have come out of ‘em till I took an oath not to marry anybody--or they’d have got out a commission of lunacy, or some dreadful thing,’ said the collector, quite trembling as he spoke.
We shall be married from the Crummleses’ lodgings, and shall be delighted to see you--either before church or at breakfast-time, which you like.
I should think it was a very pleasant life, the married one, eh?’ ‘I have not the least doubt of it,’ rejoined Nicholas.
‘I might feel it was a great blow,’ said Miss Snevellicci, ‘to break up old associations and what-do-you-callems of that kind, but I would submit, my dear, I would indeed.’ ‘So would I,’ said Miss Ledrook; ‘I would rather court the yoke than shun it.
‘How do you feel now, my love?’ inquired Miss Snevellicci.
‘If you knew what I am undergoing for you!’ ‘Of course he knows it, love, and will never forget it,’ said Miss Ledrook.
‘Oh no, no, no,’ rejoined the bride; ‘but all the friends--the darling friends--of my youthful days--to leave them all--it is such a shock!’ With such expressions of sorrow, Miss Petowker went on to enumerate the dear friends of her youthful days one by one, and to call upon such of them as were present to come and embrace her.
These various remembrances being each accompanied with a series of hugs, occupied a long time, and they were obliged to drive to church very fast, for fear they should be too late.
Miss Ledrook, who was of a romantic turn, wore in her breast the miniature of some field-officer unknown, which she had purchased, a great bargain, not very long before; the other ladies displayed several dazzling articles of imitative jewellery, almost equal to real, and Mrs Crummles came out in a stern and gloomy majesty, which attracted the admiration of all beholders.
The better to support his assumed character he had determined to be greatly overcome, and, consequently, when they entered the church, the sobs of the affectionate parent were so heart-rending that the pew-opener suggested the propriety of his retiring to the vestry, and comforting himself with a glass of water before the ceremony began.
As if one was caught, trapped into the married state, pinned by the leg, instead of going into it of one’s own accord and glorying in the act!’ ‘I didn’t mean to make it out, that you were caught and trapped, and pinned by the leg,’ replied the actor.
Thus they continued to ask each other who called so loud, over and over again; and when Smike had that by heart Nicholas went to another sentence, and then to two at a time, and then to three, and so on, until at midnight poor Smike found to his unspeakable joy that he really began to remember something about the text.
Early in the morning they went to it again, and Smike, rendered more confident by the progress he had already made, got on faster and with better heart.
‘Well, I never did--’ ‘This, then, my lord,’ said Sir Mulberry, ‘is the lady to whose obliging marriage we owe so much happiness.
The girls wrote all the letters themselves,’ added Mrs. Nickleby, ‘and the writing-master touched them up afterwards with a magnifying glass and a silver pen; at least I think they wrote them, though Kate was never quite certain about that, because she didn’t know the handwriting of hers again; but anyway, I know it was a circular which they all copied, and of course it was a very gratifying thing--very gratifying.’ With similar recollections Mrs. Nickleby beguiled the tediousness of the way, until they reached the omnibus, which the extreme politeness of her new friends would not allow them to leave until it actually started, when they took their hats, as Mrs. Nickleby solemnly assured her hearers on many subsequent occasions, ‘completely off,’ and kissed their straw-coloured kid gloves till they were no longer visible.
I hope it’s Sir Mulberry--I think it must be Sir Mulberry!’ And then her thoughts flew back to her old predictions, and the number of times she had said, that Kate with no fortune would marry better than other people’s daughters with thousands; and, as she pictured with the brightness of a mother’s fancy all the beauty and grace of the poor girl who had struggled so cheerfully with her new life of hardship and trial, her heart grew too full, and the tears trickled down her face.
To say that Ralph loved or cared for--in the most ordinary acceptation of those terms--any one of God’s creatures, would be the wildest fiction.
She would be presented at court, of course.
‘Bless my heart!’ cried Mrs. Nickleby, hastily arranging her cap and front, ‘if it should be--dear me, standing in the passage all this time--why don’t you go and ask them to walk up, you stupid thing?’ While the girl was gone on this errand, Mrs. Nickleby hastily swept into a cupboard all vestiges of eating and drinking; which she had scarcely done, and seated herself with looks as collected as she could assume, when two gentlemen, both perfect strangers, presented themselves.
Pyke--Mrs. Nickleby.’ Mr. Pyke laid his hand upon his heart, and bowed low.
‘But when,’ said Mr. Pluck, ‘when I see so much sweetness and beauty on the one hand, and so much ardour and devotion on the other, I--pardon me, Pyke, I didn’t intend to resume that theme.
We come on a mission, Mrs. Nickleby.’ ‘On a mission,’ exclaimed that good lady, to whose mind a definite proposal of marriage for Kate at once presented itself in lively colours.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Mr. Pyke no sooner ascertained that he was quite right in his conjecture, than he launched into the most extravagant encomiums of the divine original; and in the warmth of his enthusiasm kissed the picture a thousand times, while Mr. Pluck pressed Mrs. Nickleby’s hand to his heart, and congratulated her on the possession of such a daughter, with so much earnestness and affection, that the tears stood, or seemed to stand, in his eyes.
Pluck!’ Mr. Pluck made no other reply than kissing Mrs. Nickleby’s hand with a great show of feeling and attachment; Mr. Pyke having done the same, both gentlemen hastily withdrew.
‘I am quite in love with that dear Mr Pluck, I declare I am,’ said Mrs. Nickleby.
Yes.’ ‘Why who--who on earth is that you have with you, mama?’ said Kate, shrinking back as she caught sight of a man smiling and kissing his hand.
‘How comes she in such society?’ Now, Kate thought thus SO hurriedly, and the surprise was so great, and moreover brought back so forcibly the recollection of what had passed at Ralph’s delectable dinner, that she turned extremely pale and appeared greatly agitated, which symptoms being observed by Mrs. Nickleby, were at once set down by that acute lady as being caused and occasioned by violent love.
‘My dear Kate,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, kissing her daughter affectionately.
There is nothing in the place, my dear--nothing, nothing.’ ‘I think there must be something in the place,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, who had been listening in silence; ‘for, soon after I was married, I went to Stratford with my poor dear Mr. Nickleby, in a post-chaise from Birmingham--was it a post-chaise though?’ said Mrs. Nickleby, considering; ‘yes, it must have been a post-chaise, because I recollect remarking at the time that the driver had a green shade over his left eye;--in a post-chaise from Birmingham, and after we had seen Shakespeare’s tomb and birthplace, we went back to the inn there, where we slept that night, and I recollect that all night long I dreamt of nothing but a black gentleman, at full length, in plaster-of-Paris, with a lay-down collar tied with two tassels, leaning against a post and thinking; and when I woke in the morning and described him to Mr Nickleby, he said it was Shakespeare just as he had been when he was alive, which was very curious indeed.
As to Mr. Wititterly, he was sufficiently busy in the body of the house, informing such of his friends and acquaintance as happened to be there, that those two gentlemen upstairs, whom they had seen in conversation with Mrs. W., were the distinguished Lord Frederick Verisopht and his most intimate friend, the gay Sir Mulberry Hawk--a communication which inflamed several respectable house-keepers with the utmost jealousy and rage, and reduced sixteen unmarried daughters to the very brink of despair.
‘If you find any attraction in looks of disgust and aversion, you--let me rejoin my friends, sir, instantly.
The good lady then, with the preliminary observation that she might be fairly supposed not to have lived in the world so long without knowing its ways, communicated a great many subtle precepts applicable to the state of courtship, and confirmed in their wisdom by her own personal experience.
Above all things she commended a strict maidenly reserve, as being not only a very laudable thing in itself, but as tending materially to strengthen and increase a lover’s ardour.
However, as the dreadful idea that Lord Verisopht also was somewhat taken with Kate, and that she, Mrs. Wititterly, was quite a secondary person, dawned upon that lady’s mind and gradually developed itself, she became possessed with a large quantity of highly proper and most virtuous indignation, and felt it her duty, as a married lady and a moral member of society, to mention the circumstance to ‘the young person’ without delay.
I am sorry to have to do it, upon my word I am very sorry, but you leave me no alternative, Miss Nickleby.’ Here Mrs. Wititterly tossed her head--not passionately, only virtuously--and remarked, with some appearance of excitement, that she feared that palpitation of the heart was coming on again.
You cannot tell what the heart of a young girl is--I have no right to expect you should; but when I tell you that I am wretched, and that my heart is breaking, I am sure you will help me.
To Newman Noggs he forwarded one half of the sum he had realised, entreating him to take an opportunity of handing it to Kate in secret, and conveying to her the warmest assurances of his love and affection.
‘But his heart failed him, and he cast about for some other way of annoying you, and making himself popular at the same time--for that’s the point.
Would that make his fortune?’ ‘Why, I don’t think it would,’ replied Mr. Folair, scratching his head, ‘because there wouldn’t be any romance about it, and he wouldn’t be favourably known.
Nonsense.’ The phenomenon, being of an affectionate nature and moreover excitable, raised a loud cry, and Miss Belvawney and Miss Bravassa actually shed tears.
‘He is the most grateful, single-hearted, affectionate creature that ever breathed.’ ‘So odd, too,’ remarked Miss Snevellicci, ‘isn’t he?’ ‘God help him, and those who have made him so; he is indeed,’ rejoined Nicholas, shaking his head.
‘There is nothing like the married state, sir, depend upon it.’ ‘Indeed!’ said Nicholas, laughing.
He knew in his cups three distinct stages of intoxication,--the dignified--the quarrelsome--the amorous.
‘I love ‘em,’ said Mr. Snevellicci, looking round the table, ‘I love ‘em, every one.’ ‘Not every one,’ reasoned Mr. Lillyvick, mildly.
‘That would include the married ladies, you know,’ said Mr. Lillyvick.
‘I love them too, sir,’ said Mr. Snevellicci.
‘I love them and they love me.’ And as if this avowal were not made in sufficient disregard and defiance of all moral obligations, what did Mr. Snevellicci do?
While he thought of it in a cold perspiration, and wondered whether it was possible that he could be dreaming, Mr. Snevellicci repeated the wink, and drinking to Mrs. Lillyvick in dumb show, actually blew her a kiss!
A pretty thing to be married indeed, if that was law!’ ‘You didn’t mind it?’ cried the collector.
With which Miss Snevellicci’s papa looked steadily and sternly at Mr. Lillyvick for some seconds, and then rising deliberately from his chair, kissed the ladies all round, beginning with Mrs. Lillyvick.
When Miss Bravassa sang her song at her lover, who according to custom stood ready to shake hands with her between the verses, they looked, not at each other, but at the London manager.
As they hurried up to the coach, which was now in the open street and all ready for starting, Nicholas was not a little astonished to find himself suddenly clutched in a close and violent embrace, which nearly took him off his legs; nor was his amazement at all lessened by hearing the voice of Mr. Crummles exclaim, ‘It is he--my friend, my friend!’ ‘Bless my heart,’ cried Nicholas, struggling in the manager’s arms, ‘what are you about?’ The manager made no reply, but strained him to his breast again, exclaiming as he did so, ‘Farewell, my noble, my lion-hearted boy!’ In fact, Mr. Crummles, who could never lose any opportunity for professional display, had turned out for the express purpose of taking a public farewell of Nicholas; and to render it the more imposing, he was now, to that young gentleman’s most profound annoyance, inflicting upon him a rapid succession of stage embraces, which, as everybody knows, are performed by the embracer’s laying his or her chin on the shoulder of the object of affection, and looking over it.
The lookers-on laughed very heartily, and as it was as well to put a good face upon the matter, Nicholas laughed too when he had succeeded in disengaging himself; and rescuing the astonished Smike, climbed up to the coach roof after him, and kissed his hand in honour of the absent Mrs. Crummles as they rolled away.
Gold, for the instant, lost its lustre in his eyes, for there were countless treasures of the heart which it could never purchase.
Not that we ever quarrelled, but he was apprenticed down in the country, and he got married there; and new ties and affections springing up about him, he forgot a poor little woman like me, as it was very reasonable he should, you know.
I never was so happy; in all my life I never was!’ The worthy soul hid her face in her handkerchief, and sobbed aloud; for it was the first opportunity she had had of unburdening her heart, and it would have its way.
Everything bespoke the affectionate care and attention of Newman Noggs, but Newman himself was not there.
With his heart beating violently, and apprehending he knew not what disaster, Nicholas returned to where he had left Smike.
Do not leave me here, dear Nicholas, or I shall die of a broken heart.’ ‘I will leave you nowhere,’ answered Nicholas--‘never again, Kate,’ he cried, moved in spite of himself as he folded her to his heart.
Nicholas sent Kate upstairs a few minutes before him, that his unlooked-for appearance might not alarm his mother, and when the way had been paved, presented himself with much duty and affection.
There are very good places to be got about the court, I know; for a friend of ours (Miss Cropley, at Exeter, my dear Kate, you recollect), he had one, and I know that it was the chief part of his duty to wear silk stockings, and a bag wig like a black watch-pocket; and to think that it should come to this after all--oh, dear, dear, it’s enough to kill one, that it is!’ With which expressions of sorrow, Mrs. Nickleby gave fresh vent to her grief, and wept piteously.
May every recollection of your life cling to your false heart, and cast their darkness on your death-bed.’ Ralph Nickleby read this letter twice, and frowning heavily, fell into a fit of musing; the paper fluttered from his hand and dropped upon the floor, but he clasped his fingers, as if he held it still.
As Newman stated it, the cause himself swaggered into the room, and grasping Ralph’s horny hand with uncommon affection, vowed that he had never seen him looking so well in all his life.
‘It knows it is not ashamed of its own popolorum tibby.’ Whatever were the circumstances which had led to such a result, it certainly appeared as though the popolorum tibby had rather miscalculated, for the nonce, the extent of his lady’s affection.
‘Me who dote upon her with the demdest ardour!
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>‘You know it almost breaks my heart, even to hear you talk of such a thing,’ replied Madame Mantalini.
‘Have I cut my heart into a demd extraordinary number of little pieces, and given them all away, one after another, to the same little engrossing demnition captivater, and can I live to be suspected by her?
This great point attained, Madame Mantalini argued the question of the allowance, and Mr Mantalini did the same, taking occasion to show that he could live with uncommon satisfaction upon bread and water, and go clad in rags, but that he could not support existence with the additional burden of being mistrusted by the object of his most devoted and disinterested affection.
‘But it will come soon enough,’ thought Ralph; ‘all love--bah!
‘She is always right,’ rejoined Mr. Mantalini soothingly, ‘and when she says it is time to go, it is time, and go she shall; and when she walks along the streets with her own tulip, the women shall say, with envy, she has got a demd fine husband; and the men shall say with rapture, he has got a demd fine wife; and they shall both be right and neither wrong, upon my life and soul--oh demmit!’ With which remarks, and many more, no less intellectual and to the purpose, Mr. Mantalini kissed the fingers of his gloves to Ralph Nickleby, and drawing his lady’s arm through his, led her mincingly away.
ha!’ Ralph never laughed, but on this occasion he produced the nearest approach to it that he could, and waiting until Mr. Squeers had enjoyed the professional joke to his heart’s content, inquired what had brought him to town.
Bless her heart!
HE was open, liberal, gallant, gay; I a crafty hunks of cold and stagnant blood, with no passion but love of saving, and no spirit beyond a thirst for gain.
When I speak of home, I speak of the place where--in default of a better--those I love are gathered together; and if that place were a gypsy’s tent, or a barn, I should call it by the same good name notwithstanding.
‘And this, Kate,’ said Nicholas, entering the room where his sister sat alone, ‘is the faithful friend and affectionate fellow-traveller whom I prepared you to receive.’ Poor Smike was bashful, and awkward, and frightened enough, at first, but Kate advanced towards him so kindly, and said, in such a sweet voice, how anxious she had been to see him after all her brother had told her, and how much she had to thank him for having comforted Nicholas so greatly in their very trying reverses, that he began to be very doubtful whether he should shed tears or not, and became still more flurried.
At length the door opened again, and a lady in mourning came in; and Nicholas kissing the lady in mourning affectionately, and calling her his mother, led her towards the chair from which Smike had risen when she entered the room.
Of course, I understand THAT, my love, without your telling me; and I said the same to Nicholas, and I AM very much pleased.
I have heard her say, often and often, that when she was a young lady, and before she was married, she was turning a corner into Oxford Street one day, when she ran against her own hairdresser, who, it seems, was escaping from a bear;--the mere suddenness of the encounter made her faint away directly.
‘I know that when I was at school, I always went at least twice every half-year to the Hawkinses at Taunton Vale, and they are much richer than the Grimbles, and connected with them in marriage; so you see it’s not so very unlikely, after all.’ Having put down Nicholas in this triumphant manner, Mrs. Nickleby was suddenly seized with a forgetfulness of Smike’s real name, and an irresistible tendency to call him Mr. Slammons; which circumstance she attributed to the remarkable similarity of the two names in point of sound both beginning with an S, and moreover being spelt with an M. But whatever doubt there might be on this point, there was none as to his being a most excellent listener; which circumstance had considerable influence in placing them on the very best terms, and inducing Mrs Nickleby to express the highest opinion of his general deportment and disposition.
Among men who have any sound and sterling qualities, there is nothing so contagious as pure openness of heart.
As they shook each other by the hand: the face of each lighted up by beaming looks of affection, which would have been most delightful to behold in infants, and which, in men so old, was inexpressibly touching: Nicholas could observe that the last old gentleman was something stouter than his brother; this, and a slight additional shade of clumsiness in his gait and stature, formed the only perceptible difference between them.
Nicholas’s heart was too full to allow of his turning into the street until he had recovered some composure.
During this short conversation, Miss Morleena, as the eldest of the family, and natural representative of her mother during her indisposition, had been hustling and slapping the three younger Miss Kenwigses, without intermission; which considerate and affectionate conduct brought tears into the eyes of Mr. Kenwigs, and caused him to declare that, in understanding and behaviour, that child was a woman.
‘She will be a treasure to the man she marries, sir,’ said Mr. Kenwigs, half aside; ‘I think she’ll marry above her station, Mr. Lumbey.’ ‘I shouldn’t wonder at all,’ replied the doctor.
‘Ay!’ said Mr. Kenwigs, as though he pitied him from his heart, ‘then you don’t know what she’s capable of.’ All this time there had been a great whisking in and out of the other room; the door had been opened and shut very softly about twenty times a minute (for it was necessary to keep Mrs. Kenwigs quiet); and the baby had been exhibited to a score or two of deputations from a select body of female friends, who had assembled in the passage, and about the street-door, to discuss the event in all its bearings.
not half enough.’ With this, the doctor laughed; but he didn’t laugh half as much as a married friend of Mrs. Kenwigs’s, who had just come in from the sick chamber to report progress, and take a small sip of brandy-and-water: and who seemed to consider it one of the best jokes ever launched upon society.
‘And very good ones too, I believe, haven’t they?’ asked the married lady.
Perhaps more, but certainly that.’ ‘And a very pretty little fortune,’ said the married lady.
I know who you mean,’ observed the married lady, nodding her head.
‘Many of my friends have met a relation of Mrs. Kenwigs’s in this very room, as would do honour to any company; that’s all.’ ‘I’ve met him,’ said the married lady, with a glance towards Dr Lumbey.
‘It’s naterally very gratifying to my feelings as a father, to see such a man as that, a kissing and taking notice of my children,’ pursued Mr Kenwigs.
‘There!’ rejoined the married lady.
She’s the very picter of her.’ Having thus directed the general attention to the young lady in question, the married lady embraced the opportunity of taking another sip of the brandy-and-water--and a pretty long sip too.
‘But such a woman as Mrs. Kenwigs was, afore she was married!
It isn’t generally known,’ said Mr. Kenwigs, dropping his voice; ‘but her figure was such, at that time, that the sign of the Britannia, over in the Holloway Road, was painted from it!’ ‘But only see what it is now,’ urged the married lady.
‘She looks a deal more like her own daughter,’ said the married lady.
‘A great deal more.’ Mr. Kenwigs was about to make some further observations, most probably in confirmation of this opinion, when another married lady, who had looked in to keep up Mrs. Kenwigs’s spirits, and help to clear off anything in the eating and drinking way that might be going about, put in her head to announce that she had just been down to answer the bell, and that there was a gentleman at the door who wanted to see Mr. Kenwigs ‘most particular.’ Shadowy visions of his distinguished relation flitted through the brain of Mr. Kenwigs, as this message was delivered; and under their influence, he dispatched Morleena to show the gentleman up straightway.
How do you find yourself, sir?’ Nicholas shook hands, kissed his old pupils all round, intrusted a large parcel of toys to the guardianship of Morleena, bowed to the doctor and the married ladies, and inquired after Mrs. Kenwigs in a tone of interest, which went to the very heart and soul of the nurse, who had come in to warm some mysterious compound, in a little saucepan over the fire.
At this juncture, proclamation was made by another married lady, that the baby had begun to eat like anything; whereupon the two married ladies, already mentioned, rushed tumultuously into the bedroom to behold him in the act.
‘He desired me to give his kindest love,’ said Nicholas.
‘His kindest love,’ resumed Nicholas; ‘and to say that he had no time to write, but that he was married to Miss Petowker.’ Mr. Kenwigs started from his seat with a petrified stare, caught his second daughter by her flaxen tail, and covered his face with his pocket-handkerchief.
The hyseters he has eat, and the pints of ale he has drank, in this house--!’ ‘It’s very trying, and very hard to bear, we know,’ said one of the married ladies; ‘but think of your dear darling wife.’ ‘Oh yes, and what she’s been a undergoing of, only this day,’ cried a great many voices.
Then, the matrons again expatiated on the expediency of taking the good gentleman to bed; observing that he would be better tomorrow, and that they knew what was the wear and tear of some men’s minds when their wives were taken as Mrs. Kenwigs had been that day, and that it did him great credit, and there was nothing to be ashamed of in it; far from it; they liked to see it, they did, for it showed a good heart.
At length, Morleena (who quite forgot she had fainted, when she found she was not noticed) announced that a chamber was ready for her afflicted parent; and Mr. Kenwigs, having partially smothered his four daughters in the closeness of his embrace, accepted the doctor’s arm on one side, and the support of Nicholas on the other, and was conducted upstairs to a bedroom which been secured for the occasion.
Nicholas, on returning Home from it, receives a mysterious and important Disclosure from the Lips of Mrs. Nickleby The square in which the counting-house of the brothers Cheeryble was situated, although it might not wholly realise the very sanguine expectations which a stranger would be disposed to form on hearing the fervent encomiums bestowed upon it by Tim Linkinwater, was, nevertheless, a sufficiently desirable nook in the heart of a busy town like London, and one which occupied a high place in the affectionate remembrances of several grave persons domiciled in the neighbourhood, whose recollections, however, dated from a much more recent period, and whose attachment to the spot was far less absorbing, than were the recollections and attachment of the enthusiastic Tim.
I wish that she could have seen us in our prosperity, and shared it, and had the happiness of knowing how dearly we loved her in it, as we did when we were two poor boys; but that was not to be.
At half-past ten--late hours for the square--there appeared a little tray of sandwiches and a bowl of bishop, which bishop coming on the top of the double-diamond, and other excitements, had such an effect upon Tim Linkinwater, that he drew Nicholas aside, and gave him to understand, confidentially, that it was quite true about the uncommonly handsome spinster, and that she was to the full as good-looking as she had been described--more so, indeed--but that she was in too much of a hurry to change her condition, and consequently, while Tim was courting her and thinking of changing his, got married to somebody else.
Still at the same time, his attentions are--that is, as far as it goes, and to a certain extent of course--a flattering sort of thing; and although I should never dream of marrying again with a dear girl like Kate still unsettled in life--’ ‘Surely, mother, such an idea never entered your brain for an instant?’ said Nicholas.
‘Bless my heart, Nicholas my dear,’ returned his mother in a peevish tone, ‘isn’t that precisely what I am saying, if you would only let me speak?
‘Every time I go to the window,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, ‘he kisses one hand, and lays the other upon his heart--of course it’s very foolish of him to do so, and I dare say you’ll say it’s very wrong, but he does it very respectfully--very respectfully indeed--and very tenderly, extremely tenderly.
And last evening,’ added Mrs. Nickleby, with increased confusion, ‘he called gently over the wall, as I was walking in the garden, and proposed marriage, and an elopement.
I would not shame you by seeming to take them to heart, or treat them earnestly for an instant.
Absurd old idiot!’ So saying, Nicholas kissed his mother, and bade her good-night, and they retired to their respective chambers.
To do Mrs. Nickleby justice, her attachment to her children would have prevented her seriously contemplating a second marriage, even if she could have so far conquered her recollections of her late husband as to have any strong inclinations that way.
But, although there was no evil and little real selfishness in Mrs. Nickleby’s heart, she had a weak head and a vain one; and there was something so flattering in being sought (and vainly sought) in marriage at this time of day, that she could not dismiss the passion of the unknown gentleman quite so summarily or lightly as Nicholas appeared to deem becoming.
Smike unexpectedly encounters a very old Friend, who invites him to his House, and will take no Denial Quite unconscious of the demonstrations of their amorous neighbour, or their effects upon the susceptible bosom of her mama, Kate Nickleby had, by this time, begun to enjoy a settled feeling of tranquillity and happiness, to which, even in occasional and transitory glimpses, she had long been a stranger.
Living under the same roof with the beloved brother from whom she had been so suddenly and hardly separated: with a mind at ease, and free from any persecutions which could call a blush into her cheek, or a pang into her heart, she seemed to have passed into a new state of being.
‘Not in--’ ‘Not in your brother, my dear,’ returned Miss La Creevy, anticipating the close of the sentence, ‘for he is always the same affectionate good-natured clever creature, with a spice of the--I won’t say who--in him when there’s any occasion, that he was when I first knew you.
‘Not in health?’ ‘N--n--o; perhaps not in health exactly,’ said Miss La Creevy, pausing to consider, ‘although he is a worn and feeble creature, and has that in his face which it would wring my heart to see in yours.
Now, he is another being--the same willing, harmless, faithful, loving creature--but the same in nothing else.’ ‘Surely this will all pass off,’ said Kate.
This ceremony had, of course, to be succeeded by a second kissing of Kate and Mrs. Nickleby, and a gathering together of the little basket and the brown-paper parcel, during which proceedings, ‘the omnibus,’ as Miss La Creevy protested, ‘swore so dreadfully, that it was quite awful to hear it.’ At length and at last, it made a feint of going away, and then Miss La Creevy darted out, and darted in, apologising with great volubility to all the passengers, and declaring that she wouldn’t purposely have kept them waiting on any account whatever.
Leaving it to pursue its journey at the pleasure of the conductor aforementioned, who lounged gracefully on his little shelf behind, smoking an odoriferous cigar; and leaving it to stop, or go on, or gallop, or crawl, as that gentleman deemed expedient and advisable; this narrative may embrace the opportunity of ascertaining the condition of Sir Mulberry Hawk, and to what extent he had, by this time, recovered from the injuries consequent on being flung violently from his cabriolet, under the circumstances already detailed.
Mr. Pyke and Mr. Pluck sat drinking hard in the next room, now and then varying the monotonous murmurs of their conversation with a half-smothered laugh, while the young lord--the only member of the party who was not thoroughly irredeemable, and who really had a kind heart--sat beside his Mentor, with a cigar in his mouth, and read to him, by the light of a lamp, such scraps of intelligence from a paper of the day, as were most likely to yield him interest or amusement.
He is here, good sir, waiting your pleasure, here in London, walking the streets at noonday; carrying it off jauntily; looking for you, I swear,’ said Ralph, his face darkening, and his own hatred getting the upper hand of him, for the first time, as this gay picture of Nicholas presented itself; ‘if we were only citizens of a country where it could be safely done, I’d give good money to have him stabbed to the heart and rolled into the kennel for the dogs to tear.’ As Ralph, somewhat to the surprise of his old client, vented this little piece of sound family feeling, and took up his hat preparatory to departing, Lord Frederick Verisopht looked in.
And I only wish, with all my heart and soul, that any one of us came out of this matter half as well as he does.’ So saying, Lord Frederick Verisopht walked out of the room, leaving Ralph Nickleby and Sir Mulberry in most unpleasant astonishment.
What those meditations were, and how the poor creature’s heart sunk within him when he thought--when did he, for a moment, cease to think?--of his late home, and the dear friends and familiar faces with which it was associated, cannot be told.
To prepare the mind for such a heavy sleep, its growth must be stopped by rigour and cruelty in childhood; there must be years of misery and suffering, lightened by no ray of hope; the chords of the heart, which beat a quick response to the voice of gentleness and affection, must have rusted and broken in their secret places, and bear the lingering echo of no old word of love or kindness.
I’ve only been a married man fower days, ‘account of poor old feyther deein, and puttin’ it off.
Drat it all, thot’s what I want to know.’ So, in order that he might begin to enjoy himself at once, and lose no time, Mr. Browdie gave his wife a hearty kiss, and succeeded in wresting another from Miss Squeers, after a maidenly resistance of scratching and struggling on the part of that young lady, which was not quite over when they reached the Saracen’s Head.
To have seen Miss Squeers now, divested of the brown beaver, the green veil, and the blue curl-papers, and arrayed in all the virgin splendour of a white frock and spencer, with a white muslin bonnet, and an imitative damask rose in full bloom on the inside thereof--her luxuriant crop of hair arranged in curls so tight that it was impossible they could come out by any accident, and her bonnet-cap trimmed with little damask roses, which might be supposed to be so many promising scions of the big rose--to have seen all this, and to have seen the broad damask belt, matching both the family rose and the little roses, which encircled her slender waist, and by a happy ingenuity took off from the shortness of the spencer behind,--to have beheld all this, and to have taken further into account the coral bracelets (rather short of beads, and with a very visible black string) which clasped her wrists, and the coral necklace which rested on her neck, supporting, outside her frock, a lonely cornelian heart, typical of her own disengaged affections--to have contemplated all these mute but expressive appeals to the purest feelings of our nature, might have thawed the frost of age, and added new and inextinguishable fuel to the fire of youth.
‘But you see ‘Tilda IS married at last.’ ‘And I stond threat for a soight o’ Lunnun, schoolmeasther,’ said John, vigorously attacking the pie.
‘One of them things that young men do when they get married,’ returned Squeers; ‘and as runs through with their money like nothing at all!
‘Well,’ said Squeers, turning to his daughter, ‘it’s your turn to be married next.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>6, in the court, is there?’ said Nicholas.
He made my heart ache very often.’ ‘It is a good heart,’ said Nicholas, ‘that disentangles itself from the close avocations of every day, to heed such things.
Country!’ cried Tim, with a contemptuous emphasis; ‘don’t you know that I couldn’t have such a court under my bedroom window, anywhere, but in London?’ With which inquiry, Tim turned his back, and pretending to be absorbed in his accounts, took an opportunity of hastily wiping his eyes when he supposed Nicholas was looking another way.
Mystery and disappointment are not absolutely indispensable to the growth of love, but they are, very often, its powerful auxiliaries.
‘Out of sight, out of mind,’ is well enough as a proverb applicable to cases of friendship, though absence is not always necessary to hollowness of heart, even between friends, and truth and honesty, like precious stones, are perhaps most easily imitated at a distance, when the counterfeits often pass for real.
Thus it is, that it often attains its most luxuriant growth in separation and under circumstances of the utmost difficulty; and thus it was, that Nicholas, thinking of nothing but the unknown young lady, from day to day and from hour to hour, began, at last, to think that he was very desperately in love with her, and that never was such an ill-used and persecuted lover as he.
Still, though he loved and languished after the most orthodox models, and was only deterred from making a confidante of Kate by the slight considerations of having never, in all his life, spoken to the object of his passion, and having never set eyes upon her, except on two occasions, on both of which she had come and gone like a flash of lightning--or, as Nicholas himself said, in the numerous conversations he held with himself, like a vision of youth and beauty much too bright to last--his ardour and devotion remained without its reward.
The young lady appeared no more; so there was a great deal of love wasted (enough indeed to have set up half-a-dozen young gentlemen, as times go, with the utmost decency), and nobody was a bit the wiser for it; not even Nicholas himself, who, on the contrary, became more dull, sentimental, and lackadaisical, every day.
To get through them with the greater dispatch, Tim Linkinwater proposed that they should remain at the counting-house, for a week or so, until ten o’clock at night; to this, as nothing damped the zeal of Nicholas in the service of his kind patrons--not even romance, which has seldom business habits--he cheerfully assented.
I said you loved her to distraction.’ ‘That’s true, Newman,’ replied Nicholas, with his characteristic vehemence.
Newman then went on to say, that the young lady was an only child, that her mother was dead, that she resided with her father, and that she had been induced to allow her lover a secret interview, at the intercession of her servant, who had great influence with her.
To know something of the life of one in whom I felt such interest; to see her in the street, to pass the house in which she lived, to meet her sometimes in her walks, to hope that a day might come when I might be in a condition to tell her of my love, this was the utmost extent of my thoughts.
Thinking it best to take the hint in good part, Nicholas descended, without further remonstrance, but with a countenance bespeaking anything rather than the hope and rapture of a passionate lover.
At sight of the young lady, Nicholas started and changed colour; his heart beat violently, and he stood rooted to the spot.
‘Don’t take it to heart,’ said Nicholas; ‘it’s of no consequence; you see I don’t care about it; you followed the wrong person, that’s all.’ That WAS all.
I shouldn’t have had half as much thought myself!’ ‘Mama,’ said Kate, bending over her work so that her face was almost hidden, ‘before you were married--’ ‘Dear me, Kate,’ interrupted Mrs. Nickleby, ‘what in the name of goodness graciousness makes you fly off to the time before I was married, when I’m talking to you about his thoughtfulness and attention to me?
I was going to ask, mama, before you were married, had you many suitors?’ ‘Suitors, my dear!’ cried Mrs. Nickleby, with a smile of wonderful complacency.
‘I understand it now, my dear,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, laying her hand on Kate’s; ‘don’t be alarmed, my love, it’s not directed to you, and is not intended to frighten anybody.
‘Kate, my love, pray be quiet.’ ‘Won’t you sip the goblet?’ urged the stranger, with his head imploringly on one side, and his right hand on his breast.
‘Pray, begone.’ ‘Why is it,’ said the old gentleman, coming up a step higher, and leaning his elbows on the wall, with as much complacency as if he were looking out of window, ‘why is it that beauty is always obdurate, even when admiration is as honourable and respectful as mine?’ Here he smiled, kissed his hand, and made several low bows.
This is private property, sir; you ought to know that.’ ‘I do know,’ said the old gentleman, laying his finger on his nose, with an air of familiarity, most reprehensible, ‘that this is a sacred and enchanted spot, where the most divine charms’--here he kissed his hand and bowed again--‘waft mellifluousness over the neighbours’ gardens, and force the fruit and vegetables into premature existence.
Perhaps Kate thought so, for she ventured to glance at his living portrait with some attention, as he took off his black velvet cap, and, exhibiting a perfectly bald head, made a long series of bows, each accompanied with a fresh kiss of the hand.
‘Catch the crystal globules--catch ‘em--bottle ‘em up--cork ‘em tight--put sealing wax on the top--seal ‘em with a cupid--label ‘em “Best quality”--and stow ‘em away in the fourteen binn, with a bar of iron on the top to keep the thunder off!’ Issuing these commands, as if there were a dozen attendants all actively engaged in their execution, he turned his velvet cap inside out, put it on with great dignity so as to obscure his right eye and three-fourths of his nose, and sticking his arms a-kimbo, looked very fiercely at a sparrow hard by, till the bird flew away, when he put his cap in his pocket with an air of great satisfaction, and addressed himself with respectful demeanour to Mrs. Nickleby.
I am not a youth, ma’am, as you see; and although beings like you can never grow old, I venture to presume that we are fitted for each other.’ ‘Really, Kate, my love!’ said Mrs. Nickleby faintly, and looking another way.
If you bless me with your hand and heart, you can apply to the Lord Chancellor or call out the military if necessary--sending my toothpick to the commander-in-chief will be sufficient--and so clear the house of them before the ceremony is performed.
After that, love, bliss and rapture; rapture, love and bliss.
As to my being young enough to marry again, that perhaps may be so, or it may not be; but I couldn’t think of it for an instant, not on any account whatever.
Towards their conclusion, the suitor evinced a very irreverent degree of inattention, and Mrs. Nickleby had scarcely finished speaking, when, to the great terror both of that lady and her daughter, he suddenly flung off his coat, and springing on the top of the wall, threw himself into an attitude which displayed his small-clothes and grey worsteds to the fullest advantage, and concluded by standing on one leg, and repeating his favourite bellow with increased vehemence.
‘Has he been making love to either of you?’ ‘Yes,’ said Kate.
Broke his poor wife’s heart, turned his daughters out of doors, drove his sons into the streets; it was a blessing he went mad at last, through evil tempers, and covetousness, and selfishness, and guzzling, and drinking, or he’d have drove many others so.
‘Tak’ whatever thou like’st,’ said John, ‘and when a’s gane, ca’ for more.’ Without stopping to explain, Nicholas kissed the blushing Mrs. Browdie, and handed her to her seat.
‘I have the best reason to be impressed with the feeling, mind,’ said Nicholas; ‘for if it had not been for your kindness of heart, my good friend, when I had no right or reason to expect it, I know not what might have become of me or what plight I should have been in by this time.’ ‘Talk aboot soom’at else,’ replied John, gruffly, ‘and dinnot bother.’ ‘It must be a new song to the same tune then,’ said Nicholas, smiling.
‘Especially,’ observed Mrs. Browdie, looking very sly, ‘after what we know about past and gone love matters.’ ‘We know, indeed!’ said Nicholas, shaking his head.
‘I know what life is before you, and if you was my bitterest and deadliest enemy, I could wish you nothing worse.’ ‘Couldn’t you wish to be married to him yourself, if that was the case?’ inquired Mrs. Browdie, with great suavity of manner.
Nothing of this had been unobserved by Mr. Squeers, who, so long as the attention of the company was fixed upon other objects, hugged himself to think that his son and heir should be fattening at the enemy’s expense.
At all events,’ thought Nicholas, coming to the real point in his mind, ‘there can be no danger of any prior occupation of her affections in that quarter; that’s quite clear.’ Is selfishness a necessary ingredient in the composition of that passion called love, or does it deserve all the fine things which poets, in the exercise of their undoubted vocation, have said of it?
Here was Nicholas Nickleby, who would have scorned the thought of counting how the chances stood of his rising in favour or fortune with the brothers Cheeryble, now that their nephew had returned, already deep in calculations whether that same nephew was likely to rival him in the affections of the fair unknown--discussing the matter with himself too, as gravely as if, with that one exception, it were all settled; and recurring to the subject again and again, and feeling quite indignant and ill-used at the notion of anybody else making love to one with whom he had never exchanged a word in all his life.
There was undoubted selfishness in all this, and yet Nicholas was of a most free and generous nature, with as few mean or sordid thoughts, perhaps, as ever fell to the lot of any man; and there is no reason to suppose that, being in love, he felt and thought differently from other people in the like sublime condition.
Notwithstanding all that has been said and sung to the contrary, there is no well-established case of morning having either deferred or hastened its approach by the term of an hour or so for the mere gratification of a splenetic feeling against some unoffending lover: the sun having, in the discharge of his public duty, as the books of precedent report, invariably risen according to the almanacs, and without suffering himself to be swayed by any private considerations.
I wish, too, to see your mother and sister: to know them, Mr. Nickleby, and have an opportunity of relieving their minds by assuring them that any trifling service we have been able to do them is a great deal more than repaid by the zeal and ardour you display.--Not a word, my dear sir, I beg.
The intelligence that they were to have a visitor--and such a visitor--next day, awakened in the breast of Mrs. Nickleby mingled feelings of exultation and regret; for whereas on the one hand she hailed it as an omen of her speedy restoration to good society and the almost-forgotten pleasures of morning calls and evening tea-drinkings, she could not, on the other, but reflect with bitterness of spirit on the absence of a silver teapot with an ivory knob on the lid, and a milk-jug to match, which had been the pride of her heart in days of yore, and had been kept from year’s end to year’s end wrapped up in wash-leather on a certain top shelf which now presented itself in lively colours to her sorrowing imagination.
Dear mama,’ said Kate, in great agitation, ‘I know no difference between this home and that in which we were all so happy for so many years, except that the kindest and gentlest heart that ever ached on earth has passed in peace to heaven.’ ‘Kate my dear, Kate,’ cried Mrs. Nickleby, folding her in her arms.
‘I have so often thought,’ sobbed Kate, ‘of all his kind words--of the last time he looked into my little room, as he passed upstairs to bed, and said “God bless you, darling.” There was a paleness in his face, mama--the broken heart--I know it was--I little thought so--then--’ A gush of tears came to her relief, and Kate laid her head upon her mother’s breast, and wept like a little child.
It is an exquisite and beautiful thing in our nature, that when the heart is touched and softened by some tranquil happiness or affectionate feeling, the memory of the dead comes over it most powerfully and irresistibly.
It would almost seem as though our better thoughts and sympathies were charms, in virtue of which the soul is enabled to hold some vague and mysterious intercourse with the spirits of those whom we dearly loved in life.
At the tea-table there was plenty of conversation on a great variety of subjects, nor were there wanting jocose matters of discussion, such as they were; for young Mr. Cheeryble’s recent stay in Germany happening to be alluded to, old Mr. Cheeryble informed the company that the aforesaid young Mr. Cheeryble was suspected to have fallen deeply in love with the daughter of a certain German burgomaster.
This was the pride which swelled Mrs. Nickleby’s heart that night, and this it was which left upon her face, glistening in the light when they returned home, traces of the most grateful tears she had ever shed.
Affecting to consider himself but a type of all humanity, he was at little pains to conceal his true character from the world in general, and in his own heart he exulted over and cherished every bad design as it had birth.
You were useful; not too honest, not too delicate, not too nice of hand or heart; but useful.’ ‘Useful, indeed!’ said the man.
I know you of old for a ready scoundrel, but you never had a stout heart; and hard work, with (maybe) chains upon those legs of yours, and shorter food than when I “pinched” and “ground” you, has blunted your wits, or you would not come with such a tale as this to me.
‘Go up, for the love of Gracious.
A married woman has no property.’ ‘Not a solitary single individual dem, my soul,’ and Mr. Mantalini, raising himself upon his elbow.
He was too weak; he was too good; he was a dem’d fine fellow, but he loved too strong; he could not bear her to be cross, and call him wicked names.
I often think now, I am sure, that how we ever could go through with it is quite astonishing, and that is just the evil of having a large connection and being a great deal sought after, which I would recommend all young married people steadily to resist; though of course, and it’s perfectly clear, and a very happy thing too, I think, that very few young married people can be exposed to such temptations.
This done, he made divers ungainly movements in his chair, and singling out one particular fly on the ceiling from the other flies there asleep, fixed his eyes upon him, and began to roar a meek sentiment (supposed to be uttered by a gentle swain fast pining away with love and despair) in a voice of thunder.
If he stands there,’ cried Nicholas, burning with fury, ‘looking so calmly upon those who know his black and dastardly heart, he’ll drive me mad.’ To all these exclamations John Browdie answered not a word, but he retained his hold upon Nicholas; and when he was silent again, spoke.
This being purely a labour of love, Mr. Squeers readily complied, and leaving the room for the purpose, almost immediately returned, supporting a sleek personage with an oily face, who, bursting from him, and giving to view the form and face of Mr. Snawley, made straight up to Smike, and tucking that poor fellow’s head under his arm in a most uncouth and awkward embrace, elevated his broad-brimmed hat at arm’s length in the air as a token of devout thanksgiving, exclaiming, meanwhile, ‘How little did I think of this here joyful meeting, when I saw him last!
My heart yearned towards him.
‘This is your pocket-book,’ said Ralph, producing one from his coat; ‘the certificates of your first marriage and of the boy’s birth, and your wife’s two letters, and every other paper that can support these statements directly or by implication, are here, are they?’ ‘Every one of ‘em, sir.’ ‘And you don’t object to their being looked at here, so that these people may be convinced of your power to substantiate your claim at once in law and reason, and you may resume your control over your own son without more delay.
You won’t let me love you when I want to.
‘He never loved nobody,’ bawled Squeers, through the keyhole.
‘He never loved me; he never loved Wackford, who is next door but one to a cherubim.
How can you expect that he’ll love his father?
He’ll never love his father, he won’t.
‘Your romance, sir,’ said Ralph, lingering for a moment, ‘is destroyed, I take it.
Nature does not seem to have implanted in his breast one lingering feeling of affection for him, and surely she can never err.’ ‘My dear sir,’ replied brother Charles, ‘you fall into the very common mistake of charging upon Nature, matters with which she has not the smallest connection, and for which she is in no way responsible.
‘Parents who never showed their love, complain of want of natural affection in their children; children who never showed their duty, complain of want of natural feeling in their parents; law-makers who find both so miserable that their affections have never had enough of life’s sun to develop them, are loud in their moralisings over parents and children too, and cry that the very ties of nature are disregarded.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>‘She is the daughter,’ said Mr. Cheeryble, ‘of a lady who, when she was a beautiful girl herself, and I was very many years younger, I--it seems a strange word for me to utter now--I loved very dearly.
‘My dear brother Ned,’ continued Mr. Cheeryble, ‘was to have married her sister, but she died.
She married her choice; and I wish I could add that her after-life was as happy as God knows I ever prayed it might be!’ A short silence intervened, which Nicholas made no effort to break.
‘If trial and calamity had fallen as lightly on his head, as in the deepest truth of my own heart I ever hoped (for her sake) it would, his life would have been one of peace and happiness,’ said the old gentleman calmly.
He readily availed himself of the money which, to give her but one hour’s peace of mind, I would have poured out as freely as water--nay, he often sent her back for more--and yet even while he squandered it, he made the very success of these, her applications to me, the groundwork of cruel taunts and jeers, protesting that he knew she thought with bitter remorse of the choice she had made, that she had married him from motives of interest and vanity (he was a gay young man with great friends about him when she chose him for her husband), and venting in short upon her, by every unjust and unkind means, the bitterness of that ruin and disappointment which had been brought about by his profligacy alone.
Her father lay in some secret place to avoid his creditors, reduced, between sickness and poverty, to the verge of death, and she, a child,--we might almost think, if we did not know the wisdom of all Heaven’s decrees--who should have blessed a better man, was steadily braving privation, degradation, and everything most terrible to such a young and delicate creature’s heart, for the purpose of supporting him.
She was attended, sir,’ said brother Charles, ‘in these reverses, by one faithful creature, who had been, in old times, a poor kitchen wench in the family, who was then their solitary servant, but who might have been, for the truth and fidelity of her heart--who might have been--ah!
It was in substance this: That proudly resisting all offers of permanent aid and support from her late mother’s friends, because they were made conditional upon her quitting the wretched man, her father, who had no friends left, and shrinking with instinctive delicacy from appealing in their behalf to that true and noble heart which he hated, and had, through its greatest and purest goodness, deeply wronged by misconstruction and ill report, this young girl had struggled alone and unassisted to maintain him by the labour of her hands.
That for two long years, toiling by day and often too by night, working at the needle, the pencil, and the pen, and submitting, as a daily governess, to such caprices and indignities as women (with daughters too) too often love to inflict upon their own sex when they serve in such capacities, as though in jealousy of the superior intelligence which they are necessitated to employ,--indignities, in ninety-nine cases out of every hundred, heaped upon persons immeasurably and incalculably their betters, but outweighing in comparison any that the most heartless blackleg would put upon his groom--that for two long years, by dint of labouring in all these capacities and wearying in none, she had not succeeded in the sole aim and object of her life, but that, overwhelmed by accumulated difficulties and disappointments, she had been compelled to seek out her mother’s old friend, and, with a bursting heart, to confide in him at last.
‘Does he requite her affection?’ ‘True kindness, considerate self-denying kindness, is not in his nature,’ returned Mr. Cheeryble.
The mother was a gentle, loving, confiding creature, and although he wounded her from their marriage till her death as cruelly and wantonly as ever man did, she never ceased to love him.
Such are his jealousy and hatred of me, that if he knew his daughter had opened her heart to me, he would render her life miserable with his reproaches; although--this is the inconsistency and selfishness of his character--although if he knew that every penny she had came from me, he would not relinquish one personal desire that the most reckless expenditure of her scanty stock could gratify.’ ‘An unnatural scoundrel!’ said Nicholas, indignantly.
Frank is a very good fellow--a very fine fellow--but we are afraid that he might be a little flighty and thoughtless in such a delicate matter, and that he might, perhaps--that he might, in short, be too susceptible (for she is a beautiful creature, sir; just what her poor mother was), and falling in love with her before he knew well his own mind, carry pain and sorrow into that innocent breast, which we would be the humble instruments of gradually making happy.
What if I do love and reverence this good and lovely creature.
Should I not appear a most arrogant and shallow coxcomb if I gravely represented that there was any danger of her falling in love with me?
Has not this excellent man a right to my best and heartiest services, and should any considerations of self deter me from rendering them?’ Asking himself such questions as these, Nicholas mentally answered with great emphasis ‘No!’ and persuading himself that he was a most conscientious and glorious martyr, nobly resolved to do what, if he had examined his own heart a little more carefully, he would have found he could not resist.
To the row of houses indicated to him by Mr. Charles Cheeryble, Nicholas directed his steps, without much troubling his head with such matters as these; and at this row of houses--after traversing a very dirty and dusty suburb, of which minor theatricals, shell-fish, ginger-beer, spring vans, greengrocery, and brokers’ shops, appeared to compose the main and most prominent features--he at length arrived with a palpitating heart.
But how the graces and elegancies which she had dispersed about the poorly-furnished room went to the heart of Nicholas!
Now, Madeline, my love, quick, quick!
I am not skilled in disguising my feelings, and if I were, I could not hide my heart from you.
I am your faithful servant, humbly devoted to you from this hour, devoted in strict truth and honour to him who sent me here, and in pure integrity of heart, and distant respect for you.
A giant among pigmies, a giant, a giant!’ Ralph looked at the old dog with a quiet smile as he chuckled on in this strain, and Newman Noggs in the closet felt his heart sink within him as the prospect of dinner grew fainter and fainter.
Yes, and time costs money; it’s rather an expensive article to some people we could name, or I forget my trade.’ In rejoinder to this sally, old Arthur again raised his hands, again chuckled, and again ejaculated ‘What a man it is!’ which done, he dragged the low chair a little nearer to Ralph’s high stool, and looking upwards into his immovable face, said, ‘What would you say to me, if I was to tell you that I was--that I was--going to be married?’ ‘I should tell you,’ replied Ralph, looking coldly down upon him, ‘that for some purpose of your own you told a lie, and that it wasn’t the first time and wouldn’t be the last; that I wasn’t surprised and wasn’t to be taken in.’ ‘Then I tell you seriously that I am,’ said old Arthur.
I ask again--he, he, he!--what should you say to me if I was to tell you that I was going to be married?’ ‘To some old hag?’ said Ralph.
Dark eyes, long eyelashes, ripe and ruddy lips that to look at is to long to kiss, beautiful clustering hair that one’s fingers itch to play with, such a waist as might make a man clasp the air involuntarily, thinking of twining his arm about it, little feet that tread so lightly they hardly seem to walk upon the ground--to marry all this, sir, this--hey, hey!’ ‘This is something more than common drivelling,’ said Ralph, after listening with a curled lip to the old sinner’s raptures.
‘But old Arthur Gride and matrimony is a most anomalous conjunction of words; old Arthur Gride and dark eyes and eyelashes, and lips that to look at is to long to kiss, and clustering hair that he wants to play with, and waists that he wants to span, and little feet that don’t tread upon anything--old Arthur Gride and such things as these is more monstrous still; but old Arthur Gride marrying the daughter of a ruined “dashing man” in the Rules of the Bench, is the most monstrous and incredible of all.
Secondly, he enlarged upon the character of her father, arguing, that even taking it for granted that he loved her in return with the utmost affection of which he was capable, yet he loved himself a great deal better; which Ralph said it was quite unnecessary to say anything more about, as that was very natural, and probable enough.
Now, if I offer myself to Bray as his son-in-law, upon one simple condition that the moment I am fast married he shall be quietly released, and have an allowance to live just t’other side the water like a gentleman (he can’t live long, for I have asked his doctor, and he declares that his complaint is one of the Heart and it is impossible), and if all the advantages of this condition are properly stated and dwelt upon to him, do you think he could resist me?
‘If you married this girl without me,’ said Ralph, ‘you must pay my debt in full, because you couldn’t set her father free otherwise.
For the third and last article, I require that you execute a bond to me, this day, binding yourself in the payment of these two sums, before noon of the day of your marriage with Madeline Bray.
If not, marry her without me if you can.
Finding that it was impossible to make any impression upon his staunch friend, Arthur Gride, who had prepared himself for some such result before he came, consented with a heavy heart to the proposed treaty, and upon the spot filled up the bond required (Ralph kept such instruments handy), after exacting the condition that Mr. Nickleby should accompany him to Bray’s lodgings that very hour, and open the negotiation at once, should circumstances appear auspicious and favourable to their designs.
‘I don’t know who she may be, or what she may be,’ he said: ‘but I pity her with all my heart and soul; and I can’t help her, nor can I any of the people against whom a hundred tricks, but none so vile as this, are plotted every day!
Here is an offer of marriage, that many a titled father would leap at, for his child.
‘If we are married, it will be destiny, according to that.’ ‘Then think, Mr. Bray,’ said Ralph, hastily substituting for this argument considerations more nearly allied to earth, ‘think what a stake is involved in the acceptance or rejection of these proposals of my friend.’ ‘How can I accept or reject,’ interrupted Mr. Bray, with an irritable consciousness that it really rested with him to decide.
It’s my interest that you should marry your daughter to my friend Gride, because then he sees me paid--in part, that is.
That her suitor is an old man?
Why, how often do men of family and fortune, who haven’t your excuse, but have all the means and superfluities of life within their reach, how often do they marry their daughters to old men, or (worse still) to young men without heads or hearts, to tickle some idle vanity, strengthen some family interest, or secure some seat in Parliament!
‘He is quite well now.’ It might have moved a very hard and worldly heart to see the young and beautiful creature, whose certain misery they had been contriving but a minute before, throw her arms about her father’s neck, and pour forth words of tender sympathy and love, the sweetest a father’s ear can know, or child’s lips form.
This wretched life, my love, of daily labour and fatigue, is more than you can bear, I am sure it is.
Poor Madeline!’ With these and many more kind words, Mr. Bray drew his daughter to him and kissed her cheek affectionately.
Miss Madeline, I kiss your hand.’ ‘We will shake hands, Gride,’ said Mr. Bray, extending his, as old Arthur bowed.
Madeline, my love, your hand here.’ ‘Oh dear!
After an ineffectual clutch, intended to detain and carry them to his lips, old Arthur gave his own fingers a mumbling kiss, and with many amorous distortions of visage went in pursuit of his friend, who was by this time in the street.
He is acting a virtuous part, and so considerate and affectionate, sir, that the daughter scarcely knew him.
we may wait with confidence for this day week.’ CHAPTER 48 Being for the Benefit of Mr. Vincent Crummles, and positively his last Appearance on this Stage It was with a very sad and heavy heart, oppressed by many painful ideas, that Nicholas retraced his steps eastward and betook himself to the counting-house of Cheeryble Brothers.
It would be a poor compliment to Nicholas’s better nature, and one which he was very far from deserving, to insinuate that the solution, and such a solution, of the mystery which had seemed to surround Madeline Bray, when he was ignorant even of her name, had damped his ardour or cooled the fervour of his admiration.
But, reverence for the truth and purity of her heart, respect for the helplessness and loneliness of her situation, sympathy with the trials of one so young and fair and admiration of her great and noble spirit, all seemed to raise her far above his reach, and, while they imparted new depth and dignity to his love, to whisper that it was hopeless.
Mr. Crummles was unfeignedly glad to see him, and starting up from before a small dressing-glass, with one very bushy eyebrow stuck on crooked over his left eye, and the fellow eyebrow and the calf of one of his legs in his hand, embraced him cordially; at the same time observing, that it would do Mrs. Crummles’s heart good to bid him goodbye before they went.
Nicholas, having highly commended the resolution, Mr. Crummles went on to impart such further intelligence relative to their mutual friends as he thought might prove interesting; informing Nicholas, among other things, that Miss Snevellicci was happily married to an affluent young wax-chandler who had supplied the theatre with candles, and that Mr. Lillyvick didn’t dare to say his soul was his own, such was the tyrannical sway of Mrs Lillyvick, who reigned paramount and supreme.
The company amounted in number to some twenty-five or thirty, being composed of such members of the theatrical profession, then engaged or disengaged in London, as were numbered among the most intimate friends of Mr. and Mrs. Crummles.
The board being now clear of the more substantial articles of food, and punch, wine, and spirits being placed upon it and handed about, the guests, who had been previously conversing in little groups of three or four, gradually fell off into a dead silence, while the majority of those present glanced from time to time at Mr. Snittle Timberry, and the bolder spirits did not even hesitate to strike the table with their knuckles, and plainly intimate their expectations, by uttering such encouragements as ‘Now, Tim,’ ‘Wake up, Mr. Chairman,’ ‘All charged, sir, and waiting for a toast,’ and so forth.
I shall be very glad tomorrow morning to think that I saw you again, but now I almost wish you hadn’t come.’ Nicholas was about to return a cheerful reply, when he was greatly disconcerted by the sudden apparition of Mrs. Grudden, who it seemed had declined to attend the supper in order that she might rise earlier in the morning, and who now burst out of an adjoining bedroom, habited in very extraordinary white robes; and throwing her arms about his neck, hugged him with great affection.
‘Lord ha’ mercy, what do you think they’d do without me?’ Nicholas submitted to another hug with even a better grace than before, if that were possible, and waving his hat as cheerfully as he could, took farewell of the Vincent Crummleses.
‘Bless my heart, Kate!’ cried Mrs. Nickleby, with her wonted suddenness, ‘what a colour you have got; why, you’re quite flushed!’ ‘Oh, mama!
I declare I’m quite sorry to think he should be in love with a German lady, that I am.’ ‘He said very positively that it was no such thing, mama,’ returned Kate.
I shall tell him point-blank next time he comes, that I wish he would marry one of his own country-women; and see what he says to that.’ ‘Pray don’t think of such a thing, mama,’ returned Kate, hastily; ‘not for the world.
Indeed, there sprung up quite a flirtation between Miss La Creevy and Tim Linkinwater, who said a thousand jocose and facetious things, and became, by degrees, quite gallant, not to say tender.
This avowal was considered so honourable to Tim, that neither Mrs. Nickleby nor Miss La Creevy could sufficiently extol it; and stimulated by their praises, Tim launched out into several other declarations also manifesting the disinterestedness of his heart, and a great devotion to the fair sex: which were received with no less approbation.
Advancing to the door of the mysterious apartment, they were not a little surprised to hear a human voice, chanting with a highly elaborated expression of melancholy, and in tones of suffocation which a human voice might have produced from under five or six feather-beds of the best quality, the once popular air of ‘Has she then failed in her truth, the beautiful maid I adore?’ Nor, on bursting into the room without demanding a parley, was their astonishment lessened by the discovery that these romantic sounds certainly proceeded from the throat of some man up the chimney, of whom nothing was visible but a pair of legs, which were dangling above the grate; apparently feeling, with extreme anxiety, for the top bar whereon to effect a landing.
Do you know him, ma’am?’ ‘Kate, my dear,’ said Mrs. Nickleby, deliberately sitting herself down in a chair with that sort of desperate resignation which seemed to imply that now matters had come to a crisis, and all disguise was useless, ‘you will have the goodness, my love, to explain precisely how this matter stands.
It’s a very hard case--harder than anything I was ever exposed to, before I married your poor dear papa, though I suffered a good deal of annoyance then--but that, of course, I expected, and made up my mind for.
It happened, too, that the instant the old gentleman saw her, he stopped short, skipped suddenly on his feet, and fell to kissing his hand violently: a change of demeanour which almost terrified the little portrait painter out of her senses, and caused her to retreat behind Tim Linkinwater with the utmost expedition.
My love, my life, my bride, my peerless beauty.
‘She is come!’ said the old gentleman, laying his hand upon his heart.
And therefore I think it my duty to tell that gentleman that he is mistaken, that I am the lady who he was told by some impertinent person was niece to the Council of Paving-stones, and that I do beg and entreat of him to go quietly away, if it’s only for,’ here Mrs. Nickleby simpered and hesitated, ‘for MY sake.’ It might have been expected that the old gentleman would have been penetrated to the heart by the delicacy and condescension of this appeal, and that he would at least have returned a courteous and suitable reply.
‘I, my love,’ replied Mrs. Nickleby, with a desperate calmness.
‘Why, Kate,’ said Nicholas, drawing his sister towards him and kissing her, ‘let me see your face.
My heart is very full; you do not know how full it is.’ He wrung Nicholas’s hand before he released it; and glancing, for a moment, at the brother and sister as they stood together, as if there were something in their strong affection which touched him very deeply, withdrew into his chamber, and was soon the only watcher under that quiet roof.
Let me think.’ The result of his cogitations appeared to be unfavourable, for he folded the garment once more, laid it aside, and mounted on a chair to get down another, chirping while he did so: Young, loving, and fair, Oh what happiness there!
I’ll be married in the bottle-green.
‘And what do YOU want?’ ‘I’ll be married in the bottle-green,’ cried Arthur Gride.
‘It’s a deal too good to be married in, master,’ rejoined Peg, after a short inspection of the suit.
I always say the same of you.’ ‘That’s “Curse Mr. Noggs with all my heart!” then, if you do,’ thought Newman, as Gride hurried out.
‘I saw Bray again this morning, and proposed the day after tomorrow (as you suggested) for the marriage.
Restrain your youthful ardour for eight-and-forty hours, and leave her to the father.
Can you stand idly by, and let that unnatural marriage take place without one attempt to save her?’ ‘What do you mean?’ exclaimed Nicholas, starting up; ‘marriage!
‘Do you know that within one day, by means of your uncle Ralph, she will be married to a man as bad as he, and worse, if worse there is?
Rage, astonishment, indignation, and a storm of passions, rushed through the listener’s heart, as the plot was laid bare.
The mere circumstance of the compact between Ralph Nickleby and Gride would not invalidate the marriage, or render Bray averse to it, who, if he did not actually know of the existence of some such understanding, doubtless suspected it.
Every feeling of sympathy for her forlorn condition, and of admiration for her heroism and fortitude, aggravated the indignation which shook him in every limb, and swelled his heart almost to bursting.
But, if Nicholas’s own heart embarrassed him, Newman’s came to his relief.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>‘It made ma cry when she knew it,’ interposed Miss Morleena, ‘but we kept it from her for a long time; and pa was very low in his spirits, but he is better now; and I was very ill, but I am better too.’ ‘Would you give your great-uncle Lillyvick a kiss if he was to ask you, Morleena?’ said the collector, with some hesitation.
She’s not an aunt of mine, and I’ll never call her one.’ Immediately upon the utterance of these words, Mr. Lillyvick caught Miss Morleena up in his arms, and kissed her; and, being by this time at the door of the house where Mr. Kenwigs lodged (which, as has been before mentioned, usually stood wide open), he walked straight up into Mr Kenwigs’s sitting-room, and put Miss Morleena down in the midst.
‘Uncle,’ said Mrs. Kenwigs, ‘to think that you should have turned your back upon me and my dear children, and upon Kenwigs which is the author of their being--you who was once so kind and affectionate, and who, if anybody had told us such a thing of, we should have withered with scorn like lightning--you that little Lillyvick, our first and earliest boy, was named after at the very altar!
‘Was it property that we ever thought of?’ ‘No,’ cried Mrs. Kenwigs, ‘I scorn it.’ ‘So do I,’ said Mr. Kenwigs, ‘and always did.’ ‘My feelings have been lancerated,’ said Mrs. Kenwigs, ‘my heart has been torn asunder with anguish, I have been thrown back in my confinement, my unoffending infant has been rendered uncomfortable and fractious, Morleena has pined herself away to nothing; all this I forget and forgive, and with you, uncle, I never can quarrel.
And Mr. and Mrs. Kenwigs both said, with strong feelings and tears of sympathy, that everything happened for the best; and conjured the good collector not to give way to unavailing grief, but to seek consolation in the society of those affectionate relations whose arms and hearts were ever open to him.
‘Out of affection and regard for you, Susan and Kenwigs,’ said Mr Lillyvick, ‘and not out of revenge and spite against her, for she is below it, I shall, tomorrow morning, settle upon your children, and make payable to the survivors of them when they come of age of marry, that money that I once meant to leave ‘em in my will.
Last night, the sacrifice of a young, affectionate, and beautiful creature, to such a wretch, and in such a cause, had seemed a thing too monstrous to succeed; and the warmer he grew, the more confident he felt that some interposition must save her from his clutches.
Come, sir, address yourself to your business at once.’ Nicholas could very well discern that the irritability and impatience of this speech were assumed, and that Bray, in his heart, was rejoiced at any interruption which promised to engage the attention of his daughter.
‘Madeline,’ said her father impatiently, ‘my love, what are you doing?’ ‘Miss Bray expects an inclosure perhaps,’ said Nicholas, speaking very distinctly, and with an emphasis she could scarcely misunderstand.
Oh, madam, if you have but one thought of him who sent me here, but one last lingering care for your own peace of mind and heart, I do for God’s sake urge you to give me a hearing.’ She attempted to pass him, but Nicholas gently detained her.
‘I speak of this marriage,’ returned Nicholas, ‘of this marriage, fixed for tomorrow, by one who never faltered in a bad purpose, or lent his aid to any good design; of this marriage, the history of which is known to me, better, far better, than it is to you.
Report this,’ said Madeline, ‘to my dear friend and benefactor, and, taking with you my prayers and thanks for him and for yourself, leave me for ever!’ ‘Not until I have besought you, with all the earnestness and fervour by which I am animated,’ cried Nicholas, ‘to postpone this marriage for one short week.
Reflect, reflect, before it is too late, on the mockery of plighting to him at the altar, faith in which your heart can have no share--of uttering solemn words, against which nature and reason must rebel--of the degradation of yourself in your own esteem, which must ensue, and must be aggravated every day, as his detested character opens upon you more and more.
I do NOT love this gentleman.
By accepting it, and by that step alone, I can release my father who is dying in this place; prolong his life, perhaps, for many years; restore him to comfort--I may almost call it affluence; and relieve a generous man from the burden of assisting one, by whom, I grieve to say, his noble heart is little understood.
Do not think so poorly of me as to believe that I feign a love I do not feel.
If I cannot, in reason or in nature, love the man who pays this price for my poor hand, I can discharge the duties of a wife: I can be all he seeks in me, and will.
Defer this marriage for a week.
Have mercy on me, sir, I beseech, and do not pierce my heart with such appeals as these.
I--I--must not, will not, remain here for another instant.’ ‘If this were a plot,’ said Nicholas, with the same violent rapidity with which she spoke, ‘a plot, not yet laid bare by me, but which, with time, I might unravel; if you were (not knowing it) entitled to fortune of your own, which, being recovered, would do all that this marriage can accomplish, would you not retract?’ ‘No, no, no!
And God be with you, sir, and my grateful heart and blessing!’ She was gone.
“Faint heart never won fair lady.” Why was my heart so faint?
I won’t eat more than I can help, and I know you love your old master too much to eat more than YOU can help, don’t you, Peg?’ ‘Don’t I what?’ said Peg.
‘Oh, dear, I wish the devil had this woman!’ cried Arthur: ‘love him too much to eat more than you can help at his expense.’ ‘At his what?’ said Peg.
You are to be married tomorrow morning.’ ‘N--n--no,’ rejoined Gride.
‘You, the disappointed lover?
I have been no lover of this lady’s.
No contract or engagement, no word of love, has ever passed between us.
I’ll beg it of her with kisses,’ said Arthur Gride.
‘Yes, and she’ll tell me, and pay them back, and we’ll laugh together, and hug ourselves, and be very merry, when we think of the poor youth that wanted to have her, but couldn’t because she was bespoke by me!’ This taunt brought such an expression into the face of Nicholas, that Arthur Gride plainly apprehended it to be the forerunner of his putting his threat of throwing him into the street in immediate execution; for he thrust his head out of the window, and holding tight on with both hands, raised a pretty brisk alarm.
And now I’ll go to sleep till half-past five, when I must get up to be married, Peg!’ With that, he jocularly tapped Mrs. Sliderskew under the chin, and appeared, for the moment, inclined to celebrate the close of his bachelor days by imprinting a kiss on her shrivelled lips.
Arthur Gride had enrobed himself in his marriage garments of bottle-green, a full hour before Mrs. Sliderskew, shaking off her more heavy slumbers, knocked at his chamber door; and he had hobbled downstairs in full array and smacked his lips over a scanty taste of his favourite cordial, ere that delicate piece of antiquity enlightened the kitchen with her presence.
‘Here is an old man about to be forced in marriage upon a girl; and to this old man there comes a handsome young fellow--you said he was handsome, didn’t you?’ ‘No!’ snarled Arthur Gride.
Philanthropy’s sake?’ ‘Not for love of the lady,’ replied Gride, ‘for he said that no word of love--his very words--had ever passed between ‘em.’ ‘He said!’ repeated Ralph, contemptuously.
I thought she would have broken her heart.
‘This marriage,’ answered Bray.
The air, carriage, and very look and expression of the brother were all reflected in the sister, but softened and refined to the nicest limit of feminine delicacy and attraction.
But if I have a girl’s weakness, I have a woman’s heart, and it is not you who in a cause like this can turn that from its purpose.’ ‘And what may your purpose be, most lofty lady?’ said Ralph.
I myself, avowing to her father from whom I come and by whom I am commissioned, will render it an act of greater baseness, meanness, and cruelty in him if he still dares to force this marriage on.
And HE wanting to marry Miss Madeline too!
‘Bless my heart, Kate!’ so the good lady argued; ‘if the Mr. Cheerybles don’t want this young lady to be married, why don’t they file a bill against the Lord Chancellor, make her a Chancery ward, and shut her up in the Fleet prison for safety?--I have read of such things in the newspapers a hundred times.
Or, if they are so very fond of her as Nicholas says they are, why don’t they marry her themselves--one of them I mean?
And even supposing they don’t want her to be married, and don’t want to marry her themselves, why in the name of wonder should Nicholas go about the world, forbidding people’s banns?’ ‘I don’t think you quite understand,’ said Kate, gently.
‘I have been married myself I hope, and I have seen other people married.
I am not to be held accountable for that; though, at the same time, as the circumstances speak for themselves, I shall take the liberty, my love, of saying that I do understand them, and perfectly well too; whatever you and Nicholas may choose to think to the contrary.
Why is such a great fuss made because this Miss Magdalen is going to marry somebody who is older than herself?
Jane Dibabs--the Dibabses lived in the beautiful little thatched white house one story high, covered all over with ivy and creeping plants, with an exquisite little porch with twining honysuckles and all sorts of things: where the earwigs used to fall into one’s tea on a summer evening, and always fell upon their backs and kicked dreadfully, and where the frogs used to get into the rushlight shades when one stopped all night, and sit up and look through the little holes like Christians--Jane Dibabs, SHE married a man who was a great deal older than herself, and WOULD marry him, notwithstanding all that could be said to the contrary, and she was so fond of him that nothing was ever equal to it.
On whom could the sweet soft voice, the light step, the delicate hand, the quiet, cheerful, noiseless discharge of those thousand little offices of kindness and relief which we feel so deeply when we are ill, and forget so lightly when we are well--on whom could they make so deep an impression as on a young heart stored with every pure and true affection that women cherish; almost a stranger to the endearments and devotion of its own sex, save as it learnt them from itself; and rendered, by calamity and suffering, keenly susceptible of the sympathy so long unknown and so long sought in vain?
Now, she would seem to open her whole heart to her unhappy victim; the next time they met, she would receive him with the most distant and studious reserve, as if a new light had broken in upon her, and, guessing his intentions, she had resolved to check them in the bud; as if she felt it her bounden duty to act with Spartan firmness, and at once and for ever to discourage hopes which never could be realised.
These seem very slight things, and I dare say you will be amused at my making them of so much importance; at the same time, my dear, I can assure you (and you’ll find this out, Nicholas, for yourself one of these days, if you ever fall in love with anybody; as I trust and hope you will, provided she is respectable and well conducted, and of course you’d never dream of falling in love with anybody who was not), I say, I can assure you that a great deal more depends upon these little things than you would suppose possible.
If you cough in the passage before you open the door, or whistle carelessly, or hum a tune, or something of that sort, to let them know you’re coming, it’s always better; because, of course, though it’s not only natural but perfectly correct and proper under the circumstances, still it is very confusing if you interrupt young people when they are--when they are sitting on the sofa, and--and all that sort of thing: which is very nonsensical, perhaps, but still they will do it.’ The profound astonishment with which her son regarded her during this long address, gradually increasing as it approached its climax in no way discomposed Mrs. Nickleby, but rather exalted her opinion of her own cleverness; therefore, merely stopping to remark, with much complacency, that she had fully expected him to be surprised, she entered on a vast quantity of circumstantial evidence of a particularly incoherent and perplexing kind; the upshot of which was, to establish, beyond the possibility of doubt, that Mr. Frank Cheeryble had fallen desperately in love with Kate.
What kind of return would that be which would be comprised in our permitting their nephew, their only relative, whom they regard as a son, and for whom it would be mere childishness to suppose they have not formed plans suitably adapted to the education he has had, and the fortune he will inherit--in our permitting him to marry a portionless girl: so closely connected with us, that the irresistible inference must be, that he was entrapped by a plot; that it was a deliberate scheme, and a speculation amongst us three?
Now, how would you feel, if they were married, and the brothers, coming here on one of those kind errands which bring them here so often, you had to break out to them the truth?
I humbly pray to God in heaven.’ It sounded like the prayer of a broken heart.
Rumours having gone abroad that Arthur was to be married that morning, very particular inquiries were made after the bride, who was held by the majority to be disguised in the person of Mr. Ralph Nickleby, which gave rise to much jocose indignation at the public appearance of a bride in boots and pantaloons, and called forth a great many hoots and groans.
The iron heart of the grim old clock, undisturbed by all the noise without, still beat heavily within its dusty case; the tottering presses slunk from the sight, as usual, in their melancholy corners; the echoes of footsteps returned the same dreary sound; the long-legged spider paused in his nimble run, and, scared by the sight of men in that his dull domain, hung motionless on the wall, counterfeiting death until they should have passed him by.
‘Sir.’ ‘We’ll avoid these precious morsels of morality if you please, and talk of business.’ ‘With all my heart, sir,’ rejoined Squeers, ‘and first let me say--’ ‘First let ME say, if you please.--Noggs!’ Newman presented himself when the summons had been twice or thrice repeated, and asked if his master called.
The certificates are all genuine, Snawley HAD another son, he HAS been married twice, his first wife IS dead, none but her ghost could tell that she didn’t write that letter, none but Snawley himself can tell that this is not his son, and that his son is food for worms!
You, who win money and revenge, at the same time and by the same process, and who are, at all events, sure of money, if not of revenge; or I, who am only sure of spending money in any case, and can but win bare revenge at last?’ As Mr. Squeers could only answer this proposition by shrugs and smiles, Ralph bade him be silent, and thankful that he was so well off; and then, fixing his eyes steadily upon him, proceeded to say: First, that Nicholas had thwarted him in a plan he had formed for the disposal in marriage of a certain young lady, and had, in the confusion attendant on her father’s sudden death, secured that lady himself, and borne her off in triumph.
Secondly, that by some will or settlement--certainly by some instrument in writing, which must contain the young lady’s name, and could be, therefore, easily selected from others, if access to the place where it was deposited were once secured--she was entitled to property which, if the existence of this deed ever became known to her, would make her husband (and Ralph represented that Nicholas was certain to marry her) a rich and prosperous man, and most formidable enemy.
Let me but retrieve this one small portion of my loss and disgrace; let me but defeat him in this one hope, dear to his heart as I know it must be; let me but do this; and it shall be the first link in such a chain which I will wind about him, as never man forged yet.’ CHAPTER 57 How Ralph Nickleby’s Auxiliary went about his Work, and how he prospered with it It was a dark, wet, gloomy night in autumn, when in an upper room of a mean house situated in an obscure street, or rather court, near Lambeth, there sat, all alone, a one-eyed man grotesquely habited, either for lack of better garments or for purposes of disguise, in a loose greatcoat, with arms half as long again as his own, and a capacity of breadth and length which would have admitted of his winding himself in it, head and all, with the utmost ease, and without any risk of straining the old and greasy material of which it was composed.
So attired, and in a place so far removed from his usual haunts and occupations, and so very poor and wretched in its character, perhaps Mrs Squeers herself would have had some difficulty in recognising her lord: quickened though her natural sagacity doubtless would have been by the affectionate yearnings and impulses of a tender wife.
He said once, he wished he was a donkey, because then he wouldn’t have a father as didn’t love him!
I’m a sort of a lawyer, Slider, of first-rate standing, and understanding too; I’m the intimate friend and confidential adwiser of pretty nigh every man, woman, and child that gets themselves into difficulties by being too nimble with their fingers, I’m--’ Mr. Squeers’s catalogue of his own merits and accomplishments, which was partly the result of a concerted plan between himself and Ralph Nickleby, and flowed, in part, from the black bottle, was here interrupted by Mrs. Sliderskew.
‘Ha, ha, ha!’ she cried, folding her arms and wagging her head; ‘and so he wasn’t married after all, wasn’t he.
Not married after all?’ ‘No,’ replied Squeers, ‘that he wasn’t!’ ‘And a young lover come and carried off the bride, eh?’ said Peg.
I’m even with him.’ ‘More than even, Slider,’ returned Squeers; ‘you’d have been even with him if he’d got married; but with the disappointment besides, you’re a long way ahead.
Show ‘em to somebody else, and take their advice.’ Mr. Squeers would, very likely, have carried on the farce of being offended a little longer, if Mrs. Sliderskew, in her anxiety to restore herself to her former high position in his good graces, had not become so extremely affectionate that he stood at some risk of being smothered by her caresses.
‘Now you see,’ said Peg, kneeling down on the floor beside him, and staying his impatient hand; ‘what’s of no use we’ll burn; what we can get any money by, we’ll keep; and if there’s any we could get him into trouble by, and fret and waste away his heart to shreds, those we’ll take particular care of; for that’s what I want to do, and what I hoped to do when I left him.’ ‘I thought,’ said Squeers, ‘that you didn’t bear him any particular good-will.
“Madeline Bray--come of age or marry--the said Madeline”--here, burn THAT!’ Eagerly throwing towards the old woman a parchment that he caught up for the purpose, Squeers, as she turned her head, thrust into the breast of his large coat, the deed in which these words had caught his eye, and burst into a shout of triumph.
It needed no such reflections as those which the memory of old days, and wanderings among scenes where our childhood has been passed, usually awaken in the most insensible minds, to soften the heart of Nicholas, and render him more than usually mindful of his drooping friend.
There was the old house too, which they would pass every day, looking up at the tiny window through which the sun used to stream in and wake him on the summer mornings--they were all summer mornings then--and climbing up the garden-wall and looking over, Nicholas could see the very rose-bush which had come, a present to Kate, from some little lover, and she had planted with her own hands.
You have so often told me we shall meet again--so very often lately, and now I feel the truth of that so strongly--that I can even bear to part from you.’ The trembling voice and tearful eye, and the closer grasp of the arm which accompanied these latter words, showed how they filled the speaker’s heart; nor were there wanting indications of how deeply they had touched the heart of him to whom they were addressed.
‘You will forgive me; I could not help it, but though I would have died to make her happy, it broke my heart to see--I know he loves her dearly--Oh!
who could find that out so soon as I?’ The words which followed were feebly and faintly uttered, and broken by long pauses; but, from them, Nicholas learnt, for the first time, that the dying boy, with all the ardour of a nature concentrated on one absorbing, hopeless, secret passion, loved his sister Kate.
They embraced, and kissed each other on the cheek.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>From that moment, his heart began to fail him.
What if we tell you that a poor unfortunate boy: a child in everything but never having known one of those tender endearments, or one of those lightsome hours which make our childhood a time to be remembered like a happy dream through all our after life: a warm-hearted, harmless, affectionate creature, who never offended you, or did you wrong, but on whom you have vented the malice and hatred you have conceived for your nephew, and whom you have made an instrument for wreaking your bad passions upon him: what if we tell you that, sinking under your persecution, sir, and the misery and ill-usage of a life short in years but long in suffering, this poor creature has gone to tell his sad tale where, for your part in it, you must surely answer?’ ‘If you tell me,’ said Ralph; ‘if you tell me that he is dead, I forgive you all else.
In course of time, he married her.
The same love of gain which led him to contract this marriage, led to its being kept strictly private; for a clause in her father’s will declared that if she married without her brother’s consent, the property, in which she had only some life interest while she remained single, should pass away altogether to another branch of the family.
The brother would give no consent that the sister didn’t buy, and pay for handsomely; Mr. Nickleby would consent to no such sacrifice; and so they went on, keeping their marriage secret, and waiting for him to break his neck or die of a fever.
He did neither, and meanwhile the result of this private marriage was a son.
The brother lingered on; Mr. Nickleby’s wife constantly urged him to avow their marriage; he peremptorily refused.
Angry quarrels and recriminations took place, and when they had been married nearly seven years, and were within a few weeks of the time when the brother’s death would have adjusted all, she eloped with a younger man, and left him.’ Here he paused, but Ralph did not stir, and the brothers signed to him to proceed.
He might have been disappointed in some intention he had formed, or he might have had some natural affection, but he WAS grieved at THAT, and I was confirmed in my design of opening up the secret one day, and making it a means of getting money from him.
The meeting between him and those whom he had left there was not without strong emotion on both sides; for they had been informed by his letters of what had occurred: and, besides that his griefs were theirs, they mourned with him the death of one whose forlorn and helpless state had first established a claim upon their compassion, and whose truth of heart and grateful earnest nature had, every day, endeared him to them more and more.
When he awoke, he found Kate sitting by his bedside, who, seeing that he had opened his eyes, stooped down to kiss him.
I might strive to disguise my real feelings from anybody but you; but I will tell you that--briefly and plainly, Kate--that I love her.’ Kate’s eyes brightened, and she was going to make some reply, when Nicholas laid his hand upon her arm, and went on: ‘Nobody must know this but you.
Sometimes, I try to think that the time may come when I may honestly tell her this; but it is so far off; in such distant perspective, so many years must elapse before it comes, and when it does come (if ever) I shall be so unlike what I am now, and shall have so outlived my days of youth and romance--though not, I am sure, of love for her--that even I feel how visionary all such hopes must be, and try to crush them rudely myself, and have the pain over, rather than suffer time to wither them, and keep the disappointment in store.
I am afraid,’ she added, her momentary composure forsaking her, ‘I am afraid I may not have said, strongly enough, how deeply I felt such disinterested love, and how earnestly I prayed for his future happiness.
How base would it be of me to take advantage of the circumstances which placed her here, or of the slight service I was happily able to render her, and to seek to engage her affections when the result must be, if I succeeded, that the brothers would be disappointed in their darling wish of establishing her as their own child, and that I must seem to hope to build my fortunes on their compassion for the young creature whom I had so meanly and unworthily entrapped: turning her very gratitude and warmth of heart to my own purpose and account, and trading in her misfortunes!
‘I don’t regret having done what was honourable and right, of course; but I do regret that this should have ever happened--at least sometimes I regret it, and sometimes I--I don’t know what I say; I am but a weak girl, Nicholas, and it has agitated me very much.’ It is no vaunt to affirm that if Nicholas had had ten thousand pounds at the minute, he would, in his generous affection for the owner of the blushing cheek and downcast eye, have bestowed its utmost farthing, in perfect forgetfulness of himself, to secure her happiness.
But all he could do was to comfort and console her by kind words; and words they were of such love and kindness, and cheerful encouragement, that poor Kate threw her arms about his neck, and declared she would weep no more.
‘What man,’ thought Nicholas proudly, while on his way, soon afterwards, to the brothers’ house, ‘would not be sufficiently rewarded for any sacrifice of fortune by the possession of such a heart as Kate’s, which, but that hearts weigh light, and gold and silver heavy, is beyond all praise?
But I am thinking like a lover, or like an ass: which I suppose is pretty nearly the same.’ Checking thoughts so little adapted to the business on which he was bound, by such self-reproofs as this and many others no less sturdy, he proceeded on his way and presented himself before Tim Linkinwater.
Did he mention Cheeryble Brothers at all?’ ‘Yes,’ said Nicholas, ‘many and many a time.’ ‘That was right of him,’ returned Tim, wiping his eyes; ‘that was very right of him.’ ‘And he mentioned your name a score of times,’ said Nicholas, ‘and often bade me carry back his love to Mr. Linkinwater.’ ‘No, no, did he though?’ rejoined Tim, sobbing outright.
And he sent his love to me, did he?
His love too!’ Tim was so completely overcome by this little mark of recollection, that he was quite unequal to any more conversation at the moment.
If he had previously sustained his firmness and fortitude, it had been by an effort which had cost him no little pain; but the warm welcome, the hearty manner, the homely unaffected commiseration, of the good old man, went to his heart, and no inward struggle could prevent his showing it.
‘If ever one mortal had reason to be penetrated with love and reverence for another: with such attachment as would make the hardest service in his behalf a pleasure and delight: with such grateful recollections as must rouse the utmost zeal and fidelity of his nature: those are the feelings which I should entertain for you, and do, from my heart and soul, believe me!’ ‘I do believe you,’ replied the old gentleman, ‘and I am happy in the belief.
I know that to anyone but myself--to you, who consider the immeasurable distance between me and this young lady, who is now your ward, and the object of your peculiar care--my loving her, even in thought, must appear the height of rashness and presumption.
But who can see her as I have seen, who can know what her life has been, and not love her?
He recounted, as nearly as he could, what had passed between himself and Kate that morning: speaking of her with such warmth of pride and affection, and dwelling so cheerfully upon the confidence they had of overcoming any selfish regrets and living contented and happy in each other’s love, that few could have heard him unmoved.
He had to pass a poor, mean burial-ground--a dismal place, raised a few feet above the level of the street, and parted from it by a low parapet-wall and an iron railing; a rank, unwholesome, rotten spot, where the very grass and weeds seemed, in their frouzy growth, to tell that they had sprung from paupers’ bodies, and had struck their roots in the graves of men, sodden, while alive, in steaming courts and drunken hungry dens.
Dying beside Nicholas, loving him, and looking upon him as something like an angel.
Here was the young lord dead, his companion abroad and beyond his reach, ten thousand pounds gone at one blow, his plot with Gride overset at the very moment of triumph, his after-schemes discovered, himself in danger, the object of his persecution and Nicholas’s love, his own wretched boy; everything crumbled and fallen upon him, and he beaten down beneath the ruins and grovelling in the dust.
That his, of all others, should have been the hands to rescue his miserable child; that he should have been his protector and faithful friend; that he should have shown him that love and tenderness which, from the wretched moment of his birth, he had never known; that he should have taught him to hate his own parent and execrate his very name; that he should now know and feel all this, and triumph in the recollection; was gall and madness to the usurer’s heart.
The dead boy’s love for Nicholas, and the attachment of Nicholas to him, was insupportable agony.
You needn’t hurry back, my love, if there is, for we don’t dine just yet, and there’s plenty of time.
‘This,’ he said, ‘is a copy of the will of Madeline’s maternal grandfather, bequeathing her the sum of twelve thousand pounds, payable either upon her coming of age or marrying.
The fortune is but a small one; but we love Madeline; and such as it is, we would rather see you allied to her with that, than to any other girl we know who has three times the money.
Will you become a suitor to her for her hand?’ ‘No, sir.
I interested myself in the recovery of that instrument, believing that her hand was already pledged to one who has a thousand times the claims upon her gratitude, and, if I mistake not, upon her heart, that I or any other man can ever urge.
How dare you think, Frank, that we would have you marry for money, when youth, beauty, and every amiable virtue and excellence were to be had for love?
How dared you, Frank, go and make love to Mr. Nickleby’s sister without telling us first what you meant to do, and letting us speak for you?’ ‘I hardly dared to hope--’ ‘You hardly dared to hope!
Madeline’s heart IS occupied.
If our poor mother had only lived to see us now, Ned, how proud it would have made her dear heart at last!’ Thus apostrophised, brother Ned, who had entered with Mrs. Nickleby, and who had been before unobserved by the young men, darted forward, and fairly hugged brother Charles in his arms.
Let me see Kate, let me kiss her.
Turn ‘em out, Ned, every one!’ Brother Charles began the clearance by leading the blushing girl to the door, and dismissing her with a kiss.
‘It’s a pleasant thing,’ said Tim, ‘to people like us, who have passed all our lives in the world alone, to see young folks that we are fond of, brought together with so many years of happiness before them.’ ‘Ah!’ cried the little woman with all her heart, ‘that it is!’ ‘Although,’ pursued Tim ‘although it makes one feel quite solitary and cast away.
‘It’s almost enough to make us get married after all, isn’t it?’ said Tim.
Why shouldn’t we both be married, instead of sitting through the long winter evenings by our solitary firesides?
Why shouldn’t we make one fireside of it, and marry each other?’ ‘Oh, Mr. Linkinwater, you’re joking!’ ‘No, no, I’m not.
Now, do, my dear!’ Five minutes after this honest and straightforward speech, little Miss La Creevy and Tim were talking as pleasantly as if they had been married for a score of years, and had never once quarrelled all the time; and five minutes after that, when Miss La Creevy had bustled out to see if her eyes were red and put her hair to rights, Tim moved with a stately step towards the drawing-room, exclaiming as he went, ‘There an’t such another woman in all London!
I shouldn’t have had the heart to put on gentleman’s clothes.
Surrounded by every fascination of love and hope, his warm heart yearned towards plain John Browdie.
Isn’t it enough that I paid two pound fourteen for you, and took you out of prison and let you live here like a gentleman, but must you go on like this: breaking my heart besides?’ ‘I will never break its heart, I will be a good boy, and never do so any more; I will never be naughty again; I beg its little pardon,’ said Mr. Mantalini, dropping the handle of the mangle, and folding his palms together; ‘it is all up with its handsome friend!
Encouraging the train of ideas which flocked upon him, he could almost persuade himself that he sat again outside the coach, with Squeers and the boys; that he heard their voices in the air; and that he felt again, but with a mingled sensation of pain and pleasure now, that old sinking of the heart, and longing after home.
When Nicholas began to describe Madeline, he sat with his mouth wide open, nudging Mrs. Browdie from time to time, and exclaiming under his breath that she must be ‘raa’ther a tidy sart,’ and when he heard at last that his young friend had come down purposely to communicate his good fortune, and to convey to him all those assurances of friendship which he could not state with sufficient warmth in writing--that the only object of his journey was to share his happiness with them, and to tell them that when he was married they must come up to see him, and that Madeline insisted on it as well as he--John could hold out no longer, but after looking indignantly at his wife, and demanding to know what she was whimpering for, drew his coat sleeve over his eyes and blubbered outright.
Bide till I coom back; on’y bide till I coom back, and ecod we’ll make a day of it.’ Giving his wife a hearty kiss, and Nicholas a no less hearty shake of the hand, John mounted his horse and rode off: leaving Mrs. Browdie to apply herself to hospitable preparations, and his young friend to stroll about the neighbourhood, and revisit spots which were rendered familiar to him by many a miserable association.
It was expected that Tim Linkinwater and Miss La Creevy would have made a third couple on the occasion, but they declined, and two or three weeks afterwards went out together one morning before breakfast, and, coming back with merry faces, were found to have been quietly married that day.
Sir Mulberry Hawk lived abroad for some years, courted and caressed, and in high repute as a fine dashing fellow.
Within a stone’s throw was another retreat, enlivened by children’s pleasant voices too; and here was Kate, with many new cares and occupations, and many new faces courting her sweet smile (and one so like her own, that to her mother she seemed a child again), the same true gentle creature, the same fond sister, the same in the love of all about her, as in her girlish days.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>THE “Lay of the Last Minstrel,” Scott’s first romantic tale, was published in January, 1805, and won for its author his first great success.
George Ellis playfully observed to Scott that “the personal appearance of the Minstrel who, though the Last, is by far the most charming of all minstrels, is by no means compensated by the idea of an author shorn of his picturesque beard, deprived of his harp, and writing letters to his intimate friends.” The Minstrel of the Lay was but a creature of imagination; the Minstrel of “Marmion” is Scott himself.
Deep graved in every British heart, Oh never let those names depart!
For talents mourn, untimely lost When best employed, and wanted most; Mourn genius high, and lore profound, And wit that loved to play, not wound; And all the reasoning powers divine, To penetrate, resolve, combine; And feelings keen, and fancy’s glow— They sleep with him who sleeps below: And if thou mourn’st they could not save From error him who owns this grave, Be every harsher thought suppressed, And sacred be the last long rest.
_Here_, where the end of earthly things Lays heroes, patriots, bards, and kings; Where stiff the hand, and still the tongue, Of those who fought, and spoke, and sung; _Here_, where the fretted aisles prolong The distant notes of holy song, As if some angel spoke again, “All peace on earth, goodwill to men;” If ever from an English heart, Oh, _here_ let prejudice depart, And, partial feeling cast aside, Record that Fox a Briton died!
From this high theme how can I part, Ere half unloaded is my heart!
But thou, my friend, canst fitly tell, (For few have read romance so well) How still the legendary lay O’er poet’s bosom holds its sway; How on the ancient minstrel strain Time lays his palsied hand in vain; And how our hearts at doughty deeds, By warriors wrought in steely weeds, Still throb for fear and pity’s sake; As when the Champion of the Lake Enters Morgana’s fated house, Or in the Chapel Perilous, Despising spells and demons’ force, Holds converse with the unburied corse; Or when, Dame Ganore’s grace to move, (Alas, that lawless was their love!)
The mightiest chiefs of British song Scorned not such legends to prolong: They gleam through Spenser’s elfin dream, And mix in Milton’s heavenly theme; And Dryden, in immortal strain, Had raised the Table Round again, But that a ribald king and court Bade him toil on, to make them sport; Demanded for their niggard pay, Fit for their souls, a looser lay, Licentious satire, song, and play; The world defrauded of the high design, Profaned the God-given strength, and marred the lofty line.
Warmed by such names, well may we then, Though dwindled sons of little men, Essay to break a feeble lance In the fair fields of old romance; Or seek the moated castle’s cell, Where long through talisman and spell, While tyrants ruled, and damsels wept, Thy Genius, Chivalry, hath slept: There sound the harpings of the North, Till he awake and sally forth, On venturous quest to prick again, In all his arms, with all his train, Shield, lance, and brand, and plume, and scarf, Fay, giant, dragon, squire, and dwarf, And wizard with his want of might, And errant maid on palfrey white.
Around the Genius weave their spells, Pure Love, who scarce his passion tells; Mystery, half veiled and half revealed; And Honour, with his spotless shield; Attention, with fixed eye; and Fear, That loves the tale she shrinks to hear; And gentle Courtesy; and Faith, Unchanged by sufferings, time, or death; And Valour, lion-mettled lord, Leaning upon his own good sword.
Well has thy fair achievement shown A worthy meed may thus be won; Ytene’s oaks—beneath whose shade Their theme the merry minstrels made, Of Ascapart, and Bevis bold, And that Red King, who, while of old, Through Boldrewood the chase he led, By his loved huntsman’s arrow bled— Ytene’s oaks have heard again Renewed such legendary strain; For thou hast sung how he of Gaul, That Amadis so famed in hall, For Oriana foiled in fight The necromancer’s felon might; And well in modern verse hast wove Partenopex’s mystic love: Hear, then, attentive to my lay, A knightly tale of Albion’s elder day.
A blithe salute, in martial sort, The minstrels well might sound, For, as Lord Marmion crossed the court, He scattered angels round.
Stout heart, and open hand!
A blazoned shield, in battle won, Ne’er guarded heart so bold.” XII.
Here may you keep your arms from rust, May breathe your war-horse well; Seldom hath passed a week but just Or feat of arms befell: The Scots can rein a mettled steed, And love to couch a spear; St. George!
Unmarked, at least unrecked, the taunt, Careless the knight replied, “No bird whose feathers gaily flaunt Delights in cage to bide; Norham is grim and grated close, Hemmed in by battlement and fosse, And many a darksome tower; And better loves my lady bright To sit in liberty and light, In fair Queen Margaret’s bower.
We hold our greyhound in our hand, Our falcon on our glove; But where shall we find leash or band For dame that loves to rove?
“Nay, if with royal James’s bride The lovely Lady Heron bide, Behold me here a messenger, Your tender greetings prompt to bear; For to the Scottish court addressed, I journey at our King’s behest, And pray you, of your grace, provide For me and mine, a trusty guide.
Little he loves such risks, I know; Yet in your guard, perchance, will go.” XXII.
“Here is a holy Palmer come From Salem first, and last from Rome: One that hath kissed the blessèd tomb, And visited each holy shrine In Araby and Palestine; On hills of Armenie hath been, Where Noah’s ark may yet be seen; By that Red Sea, too, hath he trod, Which parted at the prophet’s rod; In Sinai’s wilderness he saw The Mount where Israel heard the law, Mid thunder-dint and flashing levin, And shadows, mists, and darkness, given.
He shows Saint James’s cockle-shell; Of fair Montserrat, too, can tell; And of that grot where olives nod, Where, darling of each heart and eye, From all the youth of Sicily, Saint Rosalie retired to God.
I love such holy ramblers; still They know to charm a weary hill, With song, romance, or lay: Some jovial tale, or glee, or jest, Some lying legend, at the least, They bring to cheer the way.” XXVI.
Lord Marmion then his boon did ask; The Palmer took on him the task, So he would march with morning tide, To Scottish court to be his guide.
But not more blithe that silvan court, Than we have been at humbler sport; Though small our pomp, and mean our game Our mirth, dear Mariott, was the same.
No longer, from thy mountains dun, The yeoman hears the well-known gun, And while his honest heart glows Warm, At thought of his paternal farm, Round to his mates a brimmer fills, And drinks, “The Chieftain of the Hills!” No fairy forms, in Yarrow’s bowers, Trip o’er the walks, or tend the flowers, Fair as the elves whom Janet saw By moonlight dance on Carterhaugh; No youthful baron’s left to grace The forest-sheriff’s lonely chase, And ape, in manly step and tone, The majesty of Oberon: And she is gone, whose lovely face Is but her least and lowest grace; Though if to sylphid queen ’twere given To show our earth the charms of Heaven, She could not glide along the air, With form more light, or face more fair.
Yet cherish the remembrance still, Of the lone mountain and the rill; For trust, dear boys, the time will come When fiercer transport shall be dumb, And you will think right frequently, But, well I hope, without a sigh, On the free hours that we have spent Together, on the brown hill’s bent.
When, musing on companions gone, We doubly feel ourselves alone, Something, my friend, we yet may gain; There is a pleasure in this pain: It soothes the love of lonely rest, Deep in each gentler heart impressed.
Far in the mirror, bright and blue, Each hill’s huge outline you may view; Shaggy with heath, but lonely bare, Nor tree, nor bush, nor brake, is there, Save where of land yon slender line Bears thwart the lake the scattered pine.
Yet him whose heart is ill at ease Such peaceful solitudes displease; He loves to drown his bosom’s jar Amid the elemental war: And my black Palmer’s choice had been Some ruder and more savage scene, Like that which frowns round dark Lochskene.
Fair too she was, and kind had been As she was fair, but ne’er had seen For her a timid lover sigh, Nor knew the influence of her eye.
Black was her garb, her rigid rule Reformed on Benedictine school; Her cheek was pale, her form was spare; Vigils, and penitence austere, Had early quenched the light of youth, But gentle was the dame, in sooth: Though, vain of her religious sway, She loved to see her maids obey; Yet nothing stern was she in cell, And the nuns loved their Abbess well.
Her kinsmen bade her give her hand To one who loved her for her land; Herself, almost heart-broken now, Was bent to take the vestal vow, And shroud, within Saint Hilda’s gloom, Her blasted hopes and withered bloom.
They rested them in fair Melrose; But though alive he loved it well, Not there his relics might repose; For, wondrous tale to tell!
At length, an effort sent apart The blood that curdled to her heart, And light came to her eye, And colour dawned upon her cheek, A hectic and a fluttered streak, Like that left on the Cheviot peak, By autumn’s stormy sky; And when her silence broke at length, Still as she spoke she gathered strength, And armed herself to bear.
He saw young Clara’s face more fair, He knew her of broad lands the heir, Forgot his vows, his faith forswore, And Constance was beloved no more.
’Tis an old tale, and often told; But did my fate and wish agree, Ne’er had been read, in story old, Of maiden true betrayed for gold, That loved, or was avenged, like me.
When, loyal in his love and faith, Wilton found overthrow or death, Beneath a traitor’s spear?
Had fortune my last hope betrayed, This packet, to the King conveyed, Had given him to the headsman’s stroke, Although my heart that instant broke.
Like April morning clouds, that pass, With varying shadow, o’er the grass, And imitate, on field and furrow, Life’s chequered scene of joy and sorrow; Like streamlet of the mountain North, Now in a torrent racing forth, Now winding slow its silver train, And almost slumbering on the plain; Like breezes of the Autumn day, Whose voice inconstant dies away, And ever swells again as fast, When the ear deems its murmur past; Thus various, my romantic theme Flits, winds, or sinks, a morning dream.
Need I to thee, dear Erskine, tell I love the license all too well, In sounds now lowly, and now strong, To raise the desultory song?
“Or, if to touch such chord be thine, Restore the ancient tragic line, And emulate the notes that rung From the wild harp, which silent hung By silver Avon’s holy shore, Till twice a hundred years rolled o’er; When she, the bold enchantress, came, With fearless hand and heart on flame!
From the pale willow snatched the treasure, And swept it with a kindred measure, Till Avon’s swans, while rung the grove With Montfort’s hate and Basil’s love, Awakening at the inspired strain, Deemed their own Shakespeare lived again.” Thy friendship thus thy judgment wronging, With praises not to me belonging, In task more meet for mightiest powers, Wouldst thou engage my thriftless hours.
He’ll say, from youth he loved to see The white sail gliding by the tree.
Though no broad river swept along, To claim, perchance, heroic song; Though sighed no groves in summer gale, To prompt of love a softer tale; Though scarce a puny streamlet’s speed Claimed homage from a shepherd’s reed; Yet was poetic impulse given, By the green hill and clear blue heaven.
It was a barren scene, and wild, Where naked cliffs were rudely piled; But ever and anon between Lay velvet tufts of loveliest green; And well the lonely infant knew Recesses where the wallflower grew, And honeysuckle loved to crawl Up the low crag and ruined wall.
whose speech too oft I broke With gambol rude and timeless joke: For I was wayward, bold, and wild, A self-willed imp, a grandame’s child; But, half a plague, and half a jest, Was still endured, beloved, caressed.
Theirs was the glee of martial breast, And laughter theirs at little jest; And oft Lord Marmion deigned to aid, And mingle in the mirth they made; For though, with men of high degree, The proudest of the proud was he, Yet, trained in camps, he knew the art To win the soldier’s hardy heart.
They love a captain to obey, Boisterous as March, yet fresh as May; With open hand, and brow as free, Lover of wine and minstrelsy; Ever the first to scale a tower, As venturous in a lady’s bower: Such buxom chief shall lead his host From India’s fires to Zembla’s frost.
The harp full deftly can he strike, And wake the lover’s lute alike; To dear Saint Valentine, no thrush Sings livelier from a spring-tide bush, No nightingale her lovelorn tune More sweetly warbles to the moon.
Where shall the lover rest, Whom the fates sever From his true maiden’s breast, Parted for ever?
Yet fatal strength they boast to steel Their minds to bear the wounds they feel, Even while they writhe beneath the smart Of civil conflict in the heart.
Marmion, whose steady heart and eye Ne’er changed in worst extremity; Marmion, whose soul could scantly brook, Even from his king, a haughty look: Whose accent of command controlled, In camps, the boldest of the bold; Thought, look, and utterance failed him now— Fall’n was his glance, and flushed his brow: For either in the tone, Or something in the Palmer’s look, So full upon his conscience strook, That answer he found none.
His conscience slept, he deemed her well, And safe secured in distant cell; But, wakened by her favourite lay, And that strange Palmer’s boding say, That fell so ominous and drear Full on the object of his fear, To aid remorse’s venomed throes Dark tales of convent-vengeance rose; And Constance, late betrayed and scorned, All lovely on his soul returned; Lovely as when, at treacherous call, She left her convent’s peaceful wall, Crimsoned with shame, with terror mute, Dreading alike, escape, pursuit, Till love, victorious o’er alarms, Hid fears and blushes in his arms.
Oh, why should man’s success remove The very charms that wake his love!
While thus in Marmion’s bosom strove Repentance and reviving love, Like whirlwinds, whose contending sway I’ve seen Loch Vennachar obey, Their host the Palmer’s speech had heard, And, talkative, took up the word: “Ay, reverend Pilgrim, you, who stray From Scotland’s simple land away, To visit realms afar, Full often learn the art to know Of future weal, or future woe, By word, or sign, or star; Yet might a knight his fortune hear, If, knightlike, he despises fear, Not far from hence; if fathers old Aright our hamlet legend told.” These broken words the menials move, For marvels still the vulgar love, And, Marmion giving license cold, His tale the host thus gladly told: XIX.
There floated Haco’s banner trim, Above Norwayan warriors grim, Savage of heart, and large of limb; Threatening both continent and isle, Bute, Arran, Cunninghame, and Kyle.
‘I know,’ he said—his voice was hoarse, And broken seemed its hollow force— ‘I know the cause, although untold, Why the king seeks his vassal’s hold: Vainly from me my liege would know His kingdom’s future weal or woe But yet, if strong his arm and heart, His courage may do more than art.
If he go down, thou soon shalt know Whate’er these airy sprites can show; If thy heart fail thee in the strife, I am no warrant for thy life.’ XXIII.
“The vision made our monarch start, But soon he manned his noble heart, And in the first career they ran, The Elfin Knight fell, horse and man; Yet did a splinter of his lance Through Alexander’s visor glance, And razed the skin—a puny wound.
Apart, and nestling in the hay Of a waste loft, Fitz-Eustace lay; Scarce by the pale moonlight, were seen The foldings of his mantle green: Lightly he dreamt, as youth will dream Of sport by thicket, or by stream Of hawk or hound, of ring or glove, Or, lighter yet, of lady’s love.
If fails his heart, if his limbs fail, Benumbing death is in the gale: His paths, his landmarks, all unknown, Close to the hut, no more his own, Close to the aid he sought in vain, The morn may find the stiffened swain: The widow sees, at dawning pale, His orphans raise their feeble wail: And, close beside him, in the snow, Poor Yarrow, partner of their woe, Couches upon his master’s breast, And licks his cheek to break his rest.
Then happy those, since each must drain His share of pleasure, share of pain, Then happy those, beloved of Heaven, To whom the mingled cup is given; Whose lenient sorrows find relief, Whose joys are chastened by their grief.
Nor did the actions next his end, Speak more the father than the friend: Scarce had lamented Forbes paid The tribute to his minstrel’s shade; The tale of friendship scarce was told, Ere the narrator’s heart was cold— Far may we search before we find A heart so manly and so kind!
Whistling they came, and free of heart, But soon their mood was changed; Complaint was heard on every part, Of something disarranged.
Bevis lies dying in his stall: To Marmion who the plight dare tell, Of the good steed he loves so well?” Gaping for fear and ruth, they saw The charger panting on his straw; Till one who would seem wisest, cried, “What else but evil could betide, With that cursed Palmer for our guide?
Here, too, are twilight nooks and dells; And oft, in such, the story tells, The damsel kind, from danger freed, Did grateful pay her champion’s meed.” He spoke to cheer Lord Marmion’s mind; Perchance to show his lore designed; For Eustace much had pored Upon a huge romantic tome, In the hall-window of his home, Imprinted at the antique dome Of Caxton, or De Worde, Therefore he spoke—but spoke in vain, For Marmion answered nought again.
Their mutual greetings duly made, The Lion thus his message said:— “Though Scotland’s king hath deeply swore Ne’er to knit faith with Henry more, And strictly hath forbid resort From England to his royal court; Yet, for he knows Lord Marmion’s name, And honours much his warlike fame, My liege hath deemed it shame, and lack Of courtesy, to turn him back: And, by his order, I, your guide, Must lodging fit and fair provide, Till finds King James meet time to see The flower of English chivalry.” IX.
though now thy miry court But pens the lazy steer and sheep, Thy turrets rude and tottered keep, Have been the minstrel’s loved resort.
“Of all the palaces so fair, Built for the royal dwelling, In Scotland far beyond compare, Linlithgow is excelling; And in its park, in jovial June, How sweet the merry linnet’s tune, How blithe the blackbird’s lay; The wild-buck bells from ferny brake, The coot dives merry on the lake; The saddest heart might pleasure take To see all nature gay.
His simple majesty of face, His solemn bearing, and his pace So stately gliding on, Seemed to me ne’er did limner paint So just an image of the Saint, Who propped the Virgin in her faint— The loved Apostle John!
“In vain,” said he, “to rest I spread My burning limbs, and couched my head: Fantastic thoughts returned; And, by their wild dominion led, My heart within me burned.
Lord Marmion viewed the landscape bright— He viewed it with a chief’s delight— Until within him burned his heart And lightning from his eye did part, As on the battle-day; Such glance did falcon never dart, When stooping on his prey.
Such dusky grandeur clothed the height, Where the huge castle holds its state, And all the steep slope down, Whose ridgy back heaves to the sky, Piled deep and massy, close and high, Mine own romantic town!
But northward far, with purer blaze, On Ochil mountains fell the rays, And as each heathy top they kissed, It gleamed a purple amethyst.
Fitz Eustace’ heart felt closely pent; As if to give his rapture vent, The spur he to his charger lent, And raised his bridle hand, And making demivolte in air, Cried, “Where’s the coward that would not dare To fight for such a land!” The Lindesay smiled his joy to see; Nor Marmion’s frown repressed his glee.
There stays the minstrel, till he fling His hand o’er every Border string, And fit his harp the pomp to sing, Of Scotland’s ancient court and king, In the succeeding lay.
Oh, how altered now, When safe amid thy mountain court Thou sitt’st, like empress at her sport, And liberal, unconfined, and free, Flinging thy white arms to the sea, For thy dark cloud, with umbered lower, That hung o’er cliff, and lake, and tower, Thou gleam’st against the western ray Ten thousand lines of brighter day.
Not she, the championess of old, In Spenser’s magic tale enrolled, She for the charméd spear renowned, Which forced each knight to kiss the ground— Not she more changed, when, placed at rest, What time she was Malbecco’s guest, She gave to flow her maiden vest; When from the corslet’s grasp relieved, Free to the sight her bosom heaved; Sweet was her blue eye’s modest smile, Erst hidden by the aventayle; And down her shoulders graceful rolled Her locks profuse, of paly gold.
They who whilom, in midnight fight, Had marvelled at her matchless might, No less her maiden charms approved, But looking liked, and liking loved.
She charmed at once, and tamed the heart, Incomparable Britomarte!
Truce to these thoughts!—for, as they rise, How gladly I avert mine eyes, Bodings, or true or false, to change, For Fiction’s fair romantic range, Or for tradition’s dubious light, That hovers ’twixt the day and night: Dazzling alternately and dim, Her wavering lamp I’d rather trim, Knights, squires, and lovely dames, to see Creation of my fantasy, Than gaze abroad on reeky fen, And make of mists invading men.
Who love not more the night of June Than dull December’s gloomy noon?
But who shall teach my harp to gain A sound of the romantic strain, Whose Anglo-Norman tones whilere Could win the royal Henry’s ear, Famed Beauclerc called, for that he loved The minstrel, and his lay approved?
for thou hast known, And loved the minstrel’s varying tone, Who, like his Border sires of old, Waked a wild measure rude and bold, Till Windsor’s oaks, and Ascot plain, With wonder heard the Northern strain.
bold in thy applause, The bard shall scorn pedantic laws; And, as the ancient art could stain Achievements on the storied pane, Irregularly traced and planned, But yet so glowing and so grand— So shall he strive in changeful hue, Field, feast, and combat to renew, And loves, and arms, and harpers’ glee, And all the pomp of chivalry.
Well loved that splendid monarch aye The banquet and the song, By day the tourney, and by night The merry dance, traced fast and light, The maskers quaint, the pageant bright, The revel loud and long.
The dazzling lamps, from gallery gay, Cast on the Court a dancing ray; Here to the harp did minstrels sing; There ladies touched a softer string; With long-eared cap and motley vest The licensed fool retailed his jest; His magic tricks the juggler plied; At dice and draughts the gallants vied; While some, in close recess apart, Courted the ladies of their heart, Nor courted them in vain; For often in the parting hour Victorious Love asserts his power O’er coldness and disdain; And flinty is her heart, can view To battle march a lover true— Can hear, perchance, his last adieu, Nor own her share of pain.
he had that merry glance That seldom lady’s heart resists.
Lightly from fair to fair he flew, And loved to plead, lament, and sue— Suit lightly won and short-lived pain, For monarchs seldom sigh in vain.
X. O’er James’s heart, the courtiers say, Sir Hugh the Heron’s wife held sway: To Scotland’s Court she came, To be a hostage for her lord, Who Cessford’s gallant heart had gored, And with the king to make accord Had sent his lovely dame.
Nor to that lady free alone Did the gay king allegiance own; For the fair Queen of France Sent him a turquoise ring and glove, And charged him, as her knight and love, For her to break a lance; And strike three strokes with Scottish brand, And march three miles on Southron land, And bid the banners of his band In English breezes dance.
young Lochinvar is come out of the west, Through all the wide Border his steed was the best; And save his good broadsword, he weapons had none, He rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone; So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war, There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.
He stayed not for brake, and he stopped not for stone; He swam the Esk river, where ford there was none; But ere he alighted at Netherby gate, The bride had consented, the gallant came late; For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war, Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.
come ye in peace here, or come ye in war, Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?” “I long wooed your daughter, my suit you denied; Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide; And now am I come, with this lost love of mine, To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far, That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar.” The bride kissed the goblet: the knight took it up, He quaffed off the wine, and he threw down the cup.
So daring in love, and so dauntless in war, Have ye e’er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?
He paused, and led where Douglas stood, And with stern eye the pageant viewed— I mean that Douglas, sixth of yore, Who coronet of Angus bore, And, when his blood and heart were high, Did the third James in camp defy, And all his minions led to die On Lauder’s dreary flat: Princes and favourites long grew tame, And trembled at the homely name Of Archibald Bell-the-Cat; The same who left the dusky vale Of Hermitage in Liddisdale, Its dungeons and its towers, Where Bothwell’s turrets brave the air, And Bothwell bank is blooming fair, To fix his princely bowers.
He wears their motto on his blade, Their blazon o’er his towers displayed; Yet loves his sovereign to oppose, More than to face his country’s foes.
In answer nought could Angus speak; His proud heart swelled well-nigh to break: He turned aside, and down his cheek A burning tear there stole.
His hand the monarch sudden took; That sight his kind heart could not brook: “Now, by the Bruce’s soul, Angus, my hasty speech forgive!
A child will weep a bramble’s smart, A maid to see her sparrow part, A stripling for a woman’s heart: But woe awaits a country when She sees the tears of bearded men.
De Wilton and Lord Marmion wooed Clara de Clare, of Gloucester’s blood; Idle it were of Whitby’s dame, To say of that same blood I came; And once, when jealous rage was high, Lord Marmion said despiteously, Wilton was traitor in his heart, And had made league with Martin Swart, When he came here on Simnel’s part And only cowardice did restrain His rebel aid on Stokefield’s plain, And down he threw his glove: the thing Was tried, as wont, before the king; Where frankly did De Wilton own That Swart in Gueldres he had known; And that between them then there went Some scroll of courteous compliment.
A purer heart, a lovelier maid, Ne’er sheltered her in Whitby’s shade, No, not since Saxon Edelfled: Only one trace of earthly strain, That for her lover’s loss She cherishes a sorrow vain, And murmurs at the cross.
Perchance you may a marvel deem That Marmion’s paramour (For such vile thing she was) should scheme Her lover’s nuptial hour; But o’er him thus she hoped to gain, As privy to his honour’s stain, Illimitable power: For this she secretly retained Each proof that might the plot reveal, Instructions with his hand and seal; And thus Saint Hilda deigned, Through sinners’ perfidy impure, Her house’s glory to secure And Clare’s immortal weal.
The camp doth move; Dunedin’s streets are empty now, Save when, for weal of those they love, To pray the prayer, and vow the vow, The tottering child, the anxious fair, The grey-haired sire, with pious care, To chapels and to shrines repair— Where is the Palmer now?
No audience had Lord Marmion sought; Ever he feared to aggravate Clara de Clare’s suspicious hate; And safer ’twas, he thought, To wait till, from the nuns removed, The influence of kinsmen loved, And suit by Henry’s self approved, Her slow consent had wrought.
His was no flickering flame, that dies Unless when fanned by looks and sighs, And lighted oft at lady’s eyes; He longed to stretch his wide command O’er luckless Clara’s ample land; Besides, when Wilton with him vied, Although the pang of humbled pride The place of jealousy supplied, Yet conquest, by that meanness won He almost loathed to think upon, Led him, at times, to hate the cause Which made him burst through honour’s laws If e’er he loved, ’twas her alone Who died within that vault of stone.
At tolling of a bell, forth came The convent’s venerable dame, And prayed Saint Hilda’s Abbess rest With her, a loved and honoured guest, Till Douglas should a barque prepare To waft her back to Whitby fair.

The iron chest is bolted hard, A huntsman sits, its constant guard; Around his neck his horn is hung, His hanger in his belt is slung; Before his feet his blood-hounds lie: And ’twere not for his gloomy eye, Whose withering glance no heart can brook, As true a huntsman doth he look, As bugle e’er in brake did sound, Or ever hallooed to a hound.

WHILE great events were on the gale, And each hour brought a varying tale, And the demeanour, changed and cold, Of Douglas fretted Marmion bold, And, like the impatient steed of war He snuffed the battle from afar; And hopes were none, that back again Herald should come from Terouenne, Where England’s king in leaguer lay, Before decisive battle-day; Whilst these things were, the mournful Clare Did in the dame’s devotions share: For the good countess ceaseless prayed To Heaven and saints, her sons to aid, And with short interval did pass From prayer to book, from book to mass, And all in high baronial pride— A life both dull and dignified; Yet as Lord Marmion nothing pressed Upon her intervals of rest, Dejected Clara well could bear The formal state, the lengthened prayer, Though dearest to her wounded heart The hours that she might spend apart.
Above the rest, a turret square Did o’er its Gothic entrance bear, Of sculpture rude, a stony shield; The bloody heart was in the field, And in the chief three mullets stood, The cognisance of Douglas blood.
Fitz-Eustace, loitering with his bow, To practise on the gull and crow, Saw her, at distance, gliding slow, And did by Mary swear— Some lovelorn fay she might have been, Or, in romance, some spell-bound queen; For ne’er, in work-day world, was seen A form so witching fair.
Was it that, seared by sinful scorn, My heart could neither melt nor burn?

Your heart resembles him even more than your genius: you have the same noble enthusiasm for your sublime profession; the same lofty freedom from envy, and the spirit that depreciates; the same generous desire not to war with but to serve artists in your art; aiding, strengthening, advising, elevating the timidity of inexperience, and the vague aspirations of youth.
By the intuition of a kindred mind, you have equalled the learning of Winckelman, and the plastic poetry of Goethe, in the intimate comprehension of the antique.
I love it not the less because it has been little understood and superficially judged by the common herd: it was not meant for them.
I love it not the more because it has found enthusiastic favorers amongst the Few.
My affection for my work is rooted in the solemn and pure delight which it gave me to conceive and to perform.
Your serener existence, uniform and holy, my lot denies,--if my heart covets.
The fruit of these mystic studies is seen in &quot;Zanoni&quot; and &quot;A strange Story,&quot; romances which were a labour of love to the author, and into which he threw all the power he possessed,--power re-enforced by multifarious reading and an instinctive appreciation of Oriental thought.
In &quot;Zanoni&quot; the author introduces us to two human beings who have achieved immortality: one, Mejnour, void of all passion or feeling, calm, benignant, bloodless, an intellect rather than a man; the other, Zanoni, the pupil of Mejnour, the representative of an ideal life in its utmost perfection, possessing eternal youth, absolute power, and absolute knowledge, and withal the fullest capacity to enjoy and to love, and, as a necessity of that love, to sorrow and despair.
By his love for Viola Zanoni is compelled to descend from his exalted state, to lose his eternal calm, and to share in the cares and anxieties of humanity; and this degradation is completed by the birth of a child.
Finally, he gives up the life which hangs on that of another, in order to save that other, the loving and beloved wife, who has delivered him from his solitude and isolation.
Wife and child are mortal, and to outlive them and his love for them is impossible.
But Mejnour, who is the impersonation of thought,--pure intellect without affection,--lives on.
Bulwer has himself justly characterised this work, in the Introduction, as a romance and not a romance, as a truth for those who can comprehend it, and an extravagance for those who cannot.
The most obvious interpretation of the types is, that in Zanoni the author depicts to us humanity, perfected, sublimed, which lives not for self, but for others; in Mejnour, as we have before said, cold, passionless, self-sufficing intellect; in Glyndon, the young Englishman, the mingled strength and weakness of human nature; in the heartless, selfish artist, Nicot, icy, soulless atheism, believing nothing, hoping nothing, trusting and loving nothing; and in the beautiful, artless Viola, an exquisite creation, pure womanhood, loving, trusting and truthful.
As a work of art the romance is one of great power.
The chief interest of the story for the ordinary reader centres, not in its ghostly characters and improbable machinery, the scenes in Mejnour&#39;s chamber in the ruined castle among the Apennines, the colossal and appalling apparitions on Vesuvius, the hideous phantom with its burning eye that haunted Glyndon, but in the loves of Viola and the mysterious Zanoni, the blissful and the fearful scenes through which they pass, and their final destiny, when the hero of the story sacrifices his own &quot;charmed life&quot; to save hers, and the Immortal finds the only true immortality in death.
Among the striking passages in the work are the pathetic sketch of the old violinist and composer, Pisani, with his sympathetic &quot;barbiton&quot; which moaned, groaned, growled, and laughed responsive to the feelings of its master; the description of Viola&#39;s and her father&#39;s triumph, when &quot;The Siren,&quot; his masterpiece, is performed at the San Carlo in Naples; Glyndon&#39;s adventure at the Carnival in Naples; the death of his sister; the vivid pictures of the Reign of Terror in Paris, closing with the downfall of Robespierre and his satellites; and perhaps, above all, the thrilling scene where Zanoni leaves Viola asleep in prison when his guards call him to execution, and she, unconscious of the terrible sacrifice, but awaking and missing him, has a vision of the procession to the guillotine, with Zanoni there, radiant in youth and beauty, followed by the sudden vanishing of the headsman,--the horror,--and the &quot;Welcome&quot; of her loved one to Heaven in a myriad of melodies from the choral hosts above.
I refer those who do me the honour to read &quot;Zanoni&quot; with more attention than is given to ordinary romance, to the Poem of &quot;King Arthur,&quot; for suggestive conjecture into most of the regions of speculative research, affecting the higher and more important condition of our ultimate being, which have engaged the students of immaterial philosophy in my own age.
It absolutely went to his heart when a customer entered his shop: he watched the movements of the presumptuous intruder with a vindictive glare; he fluttered around him with uneasy vigilance,--he frowned, he groaned, when profane hands dislodged his idols from their niches.
&quot;On the contrary; people make the adoration of Shakespeare the excuse for attacking everybody else.
He listened to my conception, which was sufficiently trite and prosaic, with his usual patience; and then, thoughtfully turning to his bookshelves, took down an old volume, and read to me, first, in Greek, and secondly, in English, some extracts to the following effect:-- &quot;Plato here expresses four kinds of mania, by which I desire to understand enthusiasm and the inspiration of the gods: Firstly, the musical; secondly, the telestic or mystic; thirdly, the prophetic; and fourthly, that which belongs to love.&quot;
The author, then pursuing his comment upon Plato, observes, that &quot;one of these manias may suffice (especially that which belongs to love) to lead back the soul to its first divinity and happiness; but that there is an intimate union with them all; and that the ordinary progress through which the soul ascends is, primarily, through the musical; next, through the telestic or mystic; thirdly, through the prophetic; and lastly, through the enthusiasm of love.&quot;
&quot;Is your work a romance?&quot;
&quot;It is a romance, and it is not a romance.
They appeared to excite more curiosity than I had presumed to anticipate; and I renewed, with better heart, my laborious undertaking.
(She was a virgin of a glorious beauty, but regarded not her beauty...Negligence itself is art in those favoured by Nature, by love, and by the heavens.)
Strange as it may appear to the fairer reader, this grotesque personage had yet formed those ties which ordinary mortals are apt to consider their especial monopoly,--he was married, and had one child.
What is more strange yet, his wife was a daughter of quiet, sober, unfantastic England: she was much younger than himself; she was fair and gentle, with a sweet English face; she had married him from choice, and (will you believe it?)
she yet loved him.
How she came to marry him, or how this shy, unsocial, wayward creature ever ventured to propose, I can only explain by asking you to look round and explain first to ME how half the husbands and half the wives you meet ever found a mate!
Natural or not, they married.
This young wife loved her husband; and young and gentle as she was, she might almost be said to be the protector of the two.
And then she would so patiently, perhaps (for in true love there is not always the finest taste) so DELIGHTEDLY, listen to those storms of eccentric and fitful melody, and steal him--whispering praises all the way--from the unwholesome night-watch to rest and sleep!
All that he knew was, that he loved and blessed her.
But then, to counteract all these acquisitions, the strange habits of Pisani, and the incessant watch and care which he required from his wife, often left the child alone with an old nurse, who, to be sure, loved her dearly, but who was in no way calculated to instruct her.
Her youth had been all love, and her age was all superstition.
Boy or man, thou wilt never be a poet, if thou hast not felt the ideal, the romance, the Calypso&#39;s isle that opened to thee when for the first time the magic curtain was drawn aside, and let in the world of poetry on the world of prose!
Her recitations became full of unconscious power; her voice moved the heart to tears, or warmed it into generous rage.
It was no premature woman comprehending the love or the jealousy that the words expressed; her art was one of those strange secrets which the psychologists may unriddle to us if they please, and tell us why children of the simplest minds and the purest hearts are often so acute to distinguish, in the tales you tell them, or the songs you sing, the difference between the true art and the false, passion and jargon, Homer and Racine,--echoing back, from hearts that have not yet felt what they repeat, the melodious accents of the natural pathos.
Apart from her studies, Viola was a simple, affectionate, but somewhat wayward child,--wayward, not in temper, for that was sweet and docile; but in her moods, which, as I before hinted, changed from sad to gay and gay to sad without an apparent cause.
Rightly, then, in a typical sense, might this fair creature, so airy in her shape, so harmonious in her beauty, so unfamiliar in her ways and thoughts,--rightly might she be called a daughter, less of the musician than the music, a being for whom you could imagine that some fate was reserved, less of actual life than the romance which, to eyes that can see, and hearts that can feel, glides ever along WITH the actual life, stream by stream, to the Dark Ocean.
And therefore it seemed not strange that Viola herself, even in childhood, and yet more as she bloomed into the sweet seriousness of virgin youth, should fancy her life ordained for a lot, whether of bliss or woe, that should accord with the romance and reverie which made the atmosphere she breathed.
Frequently she would climb through the thickets that clothed the neighbouring grotto of Posilipo,--the mighty work of the old Cimmerians,--and, seated by the haunted Tomb of Virgil, indulge those visions, the subtle vagueness of which no poetry can render palpable and defined; for the Poet that surpasses all who ever sang, is the heart of dreaming youth!
It was one of his most successful airs from his beloved opera,--the Siren in the act of charming the waves and the winds to sleep.
Viola had thrown herself on his breast, and kissed him, with happy eyes that smiled through her sunny hair.
Pisani said nothing, but disappeared with the violin; and presently they heard the Familiar from the house-top (whither, when thoroughly out of humour, the musician sometimes fled), whining and sighing as if its heart were broken.
He was not one of those fond, caressing fathers whose children are ever playing round their knees; his mind and soul were so thoroughly in his art that domestic life glided by him, seemingly as if THAT were a dream, and the heart the substantial form and body of existence.
No, Pisani; often, with the keen susceptibility of childhood, poor Viola had stolen from the room to weep at the thought that thou didst not love her.
He feels THAT by the electric sympathy which ever the one heart has at once with a vast audience.
He sees his Viola on the stage, radiant in her robes and gems,--he hears her voice thrilling through the single heart of the thousands!
And while yet she gazed, and the glow returned to her heart, the stranger half rose, as if to recall the audience to a sense of the courtesy due to one so fair and young; and the instant his voice gave the signal, the audience followed it by a burst of generous applause.
Only when all was over, and she saw her father and felt his joy, did this wild spell vanish before the sweeter one of the household and filial love.
Yet again, as she turned from the stage, she looked back involuntarily, and the stranger&#39;s calm and half-melancholy smile sank into her heart,--to live there, to be recalled with confused memories, half of pleasure, and half of pain.
Pass over the congratulations of the good Cardinal-Virtuoso, astonished at finding himself and all Naples had been hitherto in the wrong on a subject of taste,--still more astonished at finding himself and all Naples combining to confess it; pass over the whispered ecstasies of admiration which buzzed in the singer&#39;s ear, as once more, in her modest veil and quiet dress, she escaped from the crowd of gallants that choked up every avenue behind the scenes; pass over the sweet embrace of father and child, returning through the starlit streets and along the deserted Chiaja in the Cardinal&#39;s carriage; never pause now to note the tears and ejaculations of the good, simple-hearted mother,--see them returned; see the well-known room, venimus ad larem nostrum (We come to our own house.
They were not those of a girl whose heart, for the first time reached through the eye, sighs its natural and native language of first love.
It was not so much admiration, though the face that reflected itself on every wave of her restless fancies was of the rarest order of majesty and beauty; nor a pleased and enamoured recollection that the sight of this stranger had bequeathed: it was a human sentiment of gratitude and delight, mixed with something more mysterious, of fear and awe.
It was a something found that had long been sought for by a thousand restless yearnings and vague desires, less of the heart than mind; not as when youth discovers the one to be beloved, but rather as when the student, long wandering after the clew to some truth in science, sees it glimmer dimly before him, to beckon, to recede, to allure, and to wane again.
The WHY I will tell you: because I saw in your heart a nobler ambition than that of the woman&#39;s vanity; it was the daughter that interested me.
&quot;A simple heart may be its own best guide, and so, go on, and prosper.
and Viola&#39;s heart sank within her; the poetry of the stage was gone.
&quot;And,&quot; said the cavalier, turning back, and gently laying his hand on hers,--&quot;and, perhaps, before we meet, you may have suffered: known the first sharp griefs of human life,--known how little what fame can gain, repays what the heart can lose; but be brave and yield not,--not even to what may seem the piety of sorrow.
What has preserved it through each disfavour of birth and circumstances,--why are its leaves as green and fair as those of the vine behind you, which, with all its arms, can embrace the open sunshine?
So with a gallant heart, through every adverse accident of sorrow and of fate to turn to the sun, to strive for the heaven; this it is that gives knowledge to the strong and happiness to the weak.
Here comes our prince of gamesters, Cetoxa; be sure that he already must have made acquaintance with so wealthy a cavalier; he has that attraction to gold which the magnet has to steel.
I bought the pillion the other day of a poet who loves his comfort; it has been newly stuffed for your special accommodation.
Shall we rest at the Volscian Anxur,--the modern Terracina,--where the lofty rock stands like the giant that guards the last borders of the southern land of love?
Dreary and desolate, their miasma is to the gardens we have passed what the rank commonplace of life is to the heart when it has left love behind.
Turn the hippogriff loose to graze: he loves the acanthus that wreathes round yon broken columns.
Monuments of murder, how poor the thoughts, how mean the memories ye awaken, compared with those that speak to the heart of man on the heights of Phyle, or by thy lone mound, grey Marathon!
But thou, Zanoni,--thou hast refused to live ONLY in the intellect; thou hast not mortified the heart; thy pulse still beats with the sweet music of mortal passion; thy kind is to thee still something warmer than an abstraction,--thou wouldst look upon this Revolution in its cradle, which the storms rock; thou wouldst see the world while its elements yet struggle through the chaos!
Among the more remarkable guests were Condorcet, then in the prime of his reputation, the correspondent of the king of Prussia, the intimate of Voltaire, the member of half the academies of Europe,--noble by birth, polished in manners, republican in opinions.
But two men there were, seated next to each other, who joined not in the general talk: the one a stranger newly arrived in Paris, where his wealth, his person, and his accomplishments, had already made him remarked and courted; the other, an old man, somewhere about seventy,--the witty and virtuous, brave, and still light-hearted Cazotte, the author of &quot;Le Diable Amoureux.&quot;
&quot;You have not shaken it off,&quot; returned the stranger, bravely; &quot;it is on you still,--on you at this hour; it beats in your heart; it kindles in your reason; it will speak in your tongue!&quot;
&quot;Fire, fire, fire in the heart, the entrails: I burn!&quot;
cried the old man,--&quot;what but loved and cherished thee?
why should I love mankind?
He selected an orphan of the lowest extraction, whose defects of person and constitution only yet the more moved his pity, and finally engrossed his affection.
In this outcast he not only loved a son, he loved a theory!
To save money for his protege,--for the only thing in the world he loved,--this became the patron&#39;s passion.
How could I love mankind if I did not?&quot;
Oh, if ever I can repay you,--if ever you want the heart&#39;s blood of Rene Dumas!&quot;
(As he did not wish that his charger (the hippogriff) should take any further excursions into the higher regions for the present, he bound him at the sea-shore to a green myrtle between a laurel and a pine.)
They make way for thee, at the orchestra,--they no longer jeer and wink, when, with a fierce fondness, thou dost caress thy Familiar, that plains, and wails, and chides, and growls, under thy remorseless hand.
The whole labour of love and sorrow fell on Viola.
Viola&#39;s heart guessed all at a single glance; she sprung to his knees; she clasped them,--&quot;Father, father, _I_ am left thee still!&quot;
Broken instrument, broken heart, withered laurel-wreath!--the setting sun through the vine-clad lattice streamed on all!
Deaf is the heart to which the Lares call from the desolate floors in vain.
And then, to hear elsewhere the name of father, mother, child,--as if death came alone to you,--to see elsewhere the calm regularity of those lives united in love and order, keeping account of happy hours, the unbroken timepiece of home, as if nowhere else the wheels were arrested, the chain shattered, the hands motionless, the chime still!
And there, from thy casement, and there, from without thy door, thou seest still the tree, solitary as thyself, and springing from the clefts of the rock, but forcing its way to light,--as, through all sorrow, while the seasons yet can renew the verdure and bloom of youth, strives the instinct of the human heart!
And all love that spoke not of the altar only shocked and repelled her.
But besides that, as grief and solitude ripened her heart, and made her tremble at times to think how deeply it could feel, her vague and early visions shaped themselves into an ideal of love.
By the gossips of Naples, his existence, supposed so extraordinary, was wellnigh forgotten; but the heart of Viola was more faithful.
She began to like, perhaps to love him, but as a sister loves; a sort of privileged familiarity sprung up between them.
Here, turning to the others, he added, &quot;You must often have felt, gentlemen, each and all of you, especially when sitting alone at night, a strange and unaccountable sensation of coldness and awe creep over you; your blood curdles, and the heart stands still; the limbs shiver; the hair bristles; you are afraid to look up, to turn your eyes to the darker corners of the room; you have a horrible fancy that something unearthly is at hand; presently the whole spell, if I may so call it, passes away, and you are ready to laugh at your own weakness.
But to change the subject,--how advances the love affair?&quot;
&quot;You must not marry her.
He had died at length, it was supposed, of grief for the sudden death of a great-grandchild, the only creature he had ever appeared to love.
He had enjoyed, almost to the reaction of satiety, the gay revelries of Naples, when he fell in love with the face and voice of Viola Pisani.
But his love, like his ambition, was vague and desultory.
It did not satisfy his whole heart and fill up his whole nature; not from want of strong and noble passions, but because his mind was not yet matured and settled enough for their development.
As there is one season for the blossom, another for the fruit; so it is not till the bloom of fancy begins to fade, that the heart ripens to the passions that the bloom precedes and foretells.
Joyous alike at his lonely easel or amidst his boon companions, he had not yet known enough of sorrow to love deeply.
It is the shallow sensualists of France, who, in their salon-language, call love &quot;a folly,&quot;--love, better understood, is wisdom.
He could not venture the hazard of seriously proposing marriage to an Italian actress; but the modest dignity of the girl, and something good and generous in his own nature, had hitherto made him shrink from any more worldly but less honourable designs.
He attended the theatre; he stole behind the scenes to converse with her; he filled his portfolio with countless sketches of a beauty that charmed him as an artist as well as lover; and day after day he floated on through a changing sea of doubt and irresolution, of affection and distrust.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I read your heart.
But Viola, contrary to her gentle habit, turned with an evident impatience from the address of her lover.
Viola, who was in the character of one who loved, but without return, never felt so acutely the part she played.
The mysterious warning of Zanoni then suddenly occurred to him; he had forgotten it in the interest of his lover&#39;s quarrel with Viola.
In all that concerned the weaknesses of the heart, Gionetta had large experience; and when, three nights before, Viola, on returning from the theatre, had wept bitterly, the nurse had succeeded in extracting from her a confession that she had seen one,--not seen for two weary and eventful years,--but never forgotten, and who, alas!
Gionetta could not comprehend all the vague and innocent emotions that swelled this sorrow; but she resolved them all, with her plain, blunt understanding, to the one sentiment of love.
Confidante to Viola&#39;s entire and deep heart she never could be,--for that heart never could have words for all its secrets.
The ravisher has no heart for repentance, but he has a hand that can murder.
Orphan, I do not speak to you in the language of your wooers; enough that I know pity, and am not ungrateful for affection.
I read your heart while I speak, and I see not one thought that should give you shame.
I say not that you love me yet; happily, the fancy may be roused long before the heart is touched.
The Englishman, Glyndon, loves thee well,--better, perhaps, than I can ever love; if not worthy of thee, yet, he has but to know thee more to deserve thee better.
Forget me; teach thyself to return and deserve his love; and I tell thee that thou wilt be honoured and be happy.&quot;
And yet, much as his words were calculated to humble or irritate, to produce indignation or excite shame, those were not the feelings with which her eyes streamed and her heart swelled.
The woman at that moment was lost in the child; and AS a child, with all its exacting, craving, yet innocent desire to be loved, weeps in unrebuking sadness when its affection is thrown austerely back upon itself,--so, without anger and without shame, wept Viola.
Look into thy heart, and thou wilt see that till again my shadow crossed thy path, there had grown up for this thine equal a pure and calm affection that would have ripened into love.
Do not think that I could nourish a love unsought and unreturned.
It is not love that I feel for thee, stranger.
&quot;No, not love,--if that be love which I have heard and read of, and sought to simulate on the stage,--but a more solemn, fearful, and, it seems to me, almost preternatural attraction, which makes me associate thee, waking or dreaming, with images that at once charm and awe.
Thinkest thou, if it were love, that I could speak to thee thus; that,&quot; she raised her looks suddenly to his, &quot;mine eyes could thus search and confront thine own?
Forewarn, rebuke, bruise my heart, reject the not unworthy gratitude it offers thee, if thou wilt, but come not always to me as an omen of grief and trouble.
Nor did her humility seem unwomanly or abject, nor that of mistress to lover, of slave to master, but rather of a child to its guardian, of a neophyte of the old religion to her priest.
He looked at her with a strange expression of kindness, of sorrow, yet of tender affection, in his eyes; but his lips were stern, and his voice cold, as he replied,-- &quot;Do you know what you ask, Viola?
Do you guess the danger to yourself--perhaps to both of us--which you court?
As a calamity, I shun what to man seems the fairest fate,--the love of the daughters of earth.
I bid thee banish from thy heart all thought of me, but as one whom the Future cries aloud to thee to avoid.
Glyndon, if thou acceptest his homage, will love thee till the tomb closes upon both.
I, too,&quot; he added with emotion,--&quot;I, too, might love thee!&quot;
&quot;Yes, Viola, I might love thee; but in that love what sorrow and what change!
The flower gives perfume to the rock on whose heart it grows.
If the Englishman love thee worthily, thy honour will be dear to him as his own; if not, there are yet other lands where love will be truer, and virtue less in danger from fraud and force.
I know your love for her.
He listened; and not the soul he had questioned, but the heart replied.
As the attraction that holds the earth in space, is the attraction that fixes the soul to earth.
You love Viola Pisani; you have for rival one of the most powerful and relentless of the Neapolitan princes.
&quot;Because you are constitutionally brave; you are fond of excitement and mystery; you like to be the hero of a romance.
&quot;But there is another course left to you: do you love Viola Pisani truly and fervently?--if so, marry her, and take a bride to your native land.&quot;
&quot;Your love, then, is but selfish lust, and I advise you to your own happiness no more.
Honourable and generous love may even now work out your happiness, and effect your escape; a frantic and selfish passion will but lead you to misery and doom.&quot;
&quot;Then you will marry her?&quot;
However, he had a brave English heart within his breast, and he recovered himself quickly.
&quot;I mean, then,&quot; continued Glyndon, resolutely, though somewhat disconcerted,--&quot;I mean you to understand, that, though I am not to be persuaded or compelled by a stranger to marry Viola Pisani, I am not the less determined never tamely to yield her to another.&quot;
But take my advice; wait yet nine days, and tell me then if you will marry the fairest and the purest creature that ever crossed your path.&quot;
&quot;But if you love her, why--why--&quot; &quot;Why am I anxious that she should wed another?--to save her from myself!
She can be all to the man she loves,--all that man can desire in wife.
Her soul, developed by affection, will elevate your own; it will influence your fortunes, exalt your destiny; you will become a great and a prosperous man.
In spite of his love for Viola, and his natural terror of such a rival, he felt himself irresistibly drawn towards the very man he had most cause to suspect and dread.
And of all the signs of a corrupt heart and a feeble head, the tendency of incredulity is the surest.
Yet, ever and anon, with the suspicion of worldly knowledge, he strove to persuade himself that Zanoni had at least some sinister object in inducing him to what his English pride and manner of thought considered a derogatory marriage with the poor actress.
It was also a notable contradiction in this person, who was addicted to the most extravagant excesses in every passion, whether of hate or love, implacable in revenge, and insatiable in debauch, that he was in the habit of uttering the most beautiful sentiments of exalted purity and genial philanthropy.
No love that did not embrace all mankind, as warm for Indus and the Pole as for the hearth of home, was worthy the breast of a generous man.
&quot;Observe,&quot; said Nicot, &quot;how much that we now cherish as a virtue will then be rejected as meanness.
&quot;I know thus much, that you are beneath my care if it be necessary to warn you against him; his own lips show the hideousness of his heart.
And THIS is not a harsh, but a loving law,--the REAL law of improvement; the wiser the few in one generation, the wiser will be the multitude the next!&quot;
I press not yet for your decision; but what man of genius ever asked more to cheer his path to the grave than love and glory?&quot;
&quot;And were this so,&quot; he said, after a pause, &quot;would it be so sweet a lot to outlive all you loved, and to recoil from every human tie?
And with these projects mingled also the vision of a love purer and serener than his life yet had known.
Insensibly before him there rose the scenes of a home, with his art sufficing for all excitement, and Viola&#39;s love circling occupation with happiness and content; and in the midst of these fantasies of a future that might be at his command, he was recalled to the present by the clear, strong voice of Mervale, the man of common-sense.
&quot;I know not all the gossip of Naples, and therefore cannot answer; but I know this, that in England no one would believe that a young Englishman, of good fortune and respectable birth, who marries a singer from the theatre of Naples, has not been lamentably taken in.
Clarence Glyndon returns to England; he marries a lady of fortune equal to his own, of friends and parentage that advance rational ambition.
Clarence Glyndon, with an easy fortune while single, has a large family which his fortune, unaided by marriage, can just rear up to callings more plebeian than his own.
You must have a feeling,--a faith in whatever is self-sacrificing and divine, whether in religion or in art, in glory or in love; or Common-sense will reason you out of the sacrifice, and a syllogism will debase the Divine to an article in the market.
Fearful of being influenced by Zanoni&#39;s counsels and his own heart, he had for the last two days shunned an interview with the young actress.
But after a night following his last conversation with Zanoni, and that we have just recorded with Mervale,--a night coloured by dreams so distinct as to seem prophetic, dreams that appeared so to shape his future according to the hints of Zanoni that he could have fancied Zanoni himself had sent them from the house of sleep to haunt his pillow,--he resolved once more to seek Viola; and though without a definite or distinct object, he yielded himself up to the impulse of his heart.
); and when that luxury has been known, when you have breathed that atmosphere of fairy-land, then you will no longer wonder why the heart ripens into fruit so sudden and so rich beneath the rosy skies and the glorious sunshine of the South.
And her very innocence, chilled at the strangeness of virgin passion, might well ascribe to magic what hearts more experienced would have resolved to love.
and the girl pressed her hand to her heart with wild energy; &quot;thou lightest every spot but this.
Phantoms float before me at night; and a fluttering, like the wing of a bird, within my heart, seems as if the spirit were terrified, and would break its cage.&quot;
You must know already that I love thee!
&quot;But you do not love this destiny, glittering though it seem; your heart is not in the vocation which your gifts adorn.&quot;
&quot;Once I loved to be the priestess of song and music; now I feel only that it is a miserable lot to be slave to a multitude.&quot;
&quot;Fly, then, with me,&quot; said the artist, passionately; &quot;quit forever the calling that divides that heart I would have all my own.
Viola, I adore thee; tell me that I do not worship in vain.&quot;
&quot;Thou art good and fair,&quot; said Viola, gazing on her lover, as he pressed nearer to her, and clasped her hand in his; &quot;but what should I give thee in return?&quot;
&quot;Love, love,--only love!&quot;
&quot;A sister&#39;s love?&quot;
I miss thee not; I think not of thee: no, I love thee not; and I will give myself only where I love.&quot;
&quot;But I would teach thee to love me; fear it not.
Nay, such love as thou describest, in our tranquil climates, is the love of innocence and youth.&quot;
she said, rising, but not conscious of the thoughts, half of shame, half suspicion, that passed through the mind of her lover.
You do not understand, you could not comprehend, the nature of her whom you think to love.
Gradually the rigour and tension of that wonderful face relaxed, the colour returned, the pulse beat: the heart animated the frame.
&quot;You err,&quot; said Viola, hastily, and with a deep sigh; &quot;he pleads for you: he informed me of your love; he besought me not--not to reject it.&quot;
It so happened that, about a month previous to the date on which our story has now entered, a paralytic affection had disabled Bernardi from the duties of his calling.
But it is not enough to a heart truly kind to send and give; more charitable is it to visit and console.
His grandchild, his little Beatrice, fell ill, suddenly and dangerously ill, of one of those rapid fevers common to the South; and Viola was summoned from her strange and fearful reveries of love or fancy, to the sick-bed of the young sufferer.
I will go and say to him, &#39;Signor, we are beggars in all else, but yesterday we were rich in love.
Let us die blessing God that the thing we love survives us.&#39;&quot;
Why did thy heart beat, Viola?
If thou canst so readily believe ill of those who have aided and yet would serve thee, thy disease is of the heart; and--nay, weep not!
&quot;And this,&quot; he added, in an altered tone, &quot;because, if thou wouldst heed my counsels, methinks I could guide a guileless heart to a happy fate.&quot;
A dark load was lifted from her heart: her step seemed to tread on air; she would have sung for very delight as she went gayly home.
It is such happiness to the pure to love,--but oh, such more than happiness to believe in the worth of the one beloved.
He did not love her in return.
But did she ask for love?
Did she herself love?
Now, suddenly, her heart felt an impulse; a new-born instinct, that bade it commune with itself, bade it disentangle its web of golden fancies,--made her wish to look upon her inmost self as in a glass.
Upsprung from the embrace of Love and Soul--the Eros and the Psyche--their beautiful offspring, Genius!
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes.
And yet he never spoke to her in the language of flattery, and almost of adoration, to which she had been accustomed.
And so trustful, obedient, and entire was the allegiance that Viola now owned to his dominion, that, unwelcome as that subject was, she restrained her heart, and listened to him in silence.
And then she pressed back the tears that gushed to her eyes; and with a strange pleasure in the midst of pain,--the pleasure of one who sacrifices heart itself to the one who commands that heart,--she answered falteringly, &quot;If thou CANST ordain it, why--&quot; &quot;Speak on.&quot;
His images have the majesty, not of the god, but the savage; utterly free, like the sublimer schools, from the common-place of imitation,--apart, with them, from the conventional littleness of the Real,--he grasps the imagination, and compels it to follow him, not to the heaven, but through all that is most wild and fantastic upon earth; a sorcery, not of the starry magian, but of the gloomy wizard,--a man of romance whose heart beat strongly, griping art with a hand of iron, and forcing it to idealise the scenes of his actual life.
&quot;A great master,&quot; said Nicot, &quot;but I do not love the school.&quot;
&quot;I do not love, but I am awed by it.
We love the beautiful and serene, but we have a feeling as deep as love for the terrible and dark.&quot;
That exquisite repose, that perfect sense of beauty, that strength without effort, that breathing moral of high art, which speaks to the mind through the eye, and raises the thoughts, by the aid of tenderness and love, to the regions of awe and wonder,--ay!
Zanoni was right: the material world shrunk from his gaze; he viewed Nature as from a mountain-top afar; and as the waves of his unquiet heart became calm and still, again the angel eyes of Viola beamed on them as a holy star.
He saw the lover, as he passed, conversing with his mistress by those mute gestures which have survived all changes of languages, the same now as when the Etruscan painted yon vases in the Museo Borbonico.
For all speculators, Utopians, alterers of the world, and wanderers from the high road, were equally hateful to him; but he could have hugged the Frenchman at that moment.
&quot;Yes, I hear he is courting the girl I mean to marry.&quot;
&quot;I, Jean Nicot, propose to marry the girl; marry her!
&quot;I may offer her marriage as well as yourself.&quot;
I love virtue, and I cannot do better than imitate Cato.
Will you marry me?&#39;
It seemed to me as if, while I lavished my heart and my youth upon visions of beauty, I was losing the beautiful realities of actual life.
And I envied the merry fisherman, singing as he passed below my casement, and the lover conversing with his mistress.&quot;
See the true artist, when abroad in men&#39;s thoroughfares, ever observant, ever diving into the heart, ever alive to the least as to the greatest of the complicated truths of existence; descending to what pedants would call the trivial and the frivolous.
The heart must rest, that the mind may be active.
As the ballast to the ship, so to the spirit are faith and love.
With your whole heart, affections, humanity, centred in one object, your mind and aspirations will become equally steadfast and in earnest.
I offer you that music in her love.&quot;
&quot;But am I sure that she does love me?&quot;
&quot;Artist, no; she loves you not at present; her affections are full of another.
But if I could transfer to you, as the loadstone transfers its attraction to the magnet, the love that she has now for me,--if I could cause her to see in you the ideal of her dreams--&quot; &quot;Is such a gift in the power of man?&quot;
&quot;I offer it to you, if your love be lawful, if your faith in virtue and yourself be deep and loyal; if not, think you that I would disenchant her with truth to make her adore a falsehood?&quot;
&quot;But if,&quot; persisted Glyndon,--&quot;if she be all that you tell me, and if she love you, how can you rob yourself of so priceless a treasure?&quot;
&quot;Oh, shallow and mean heart of man!&quot;
exclaimed Zanoni, with unaccustomed passion and vehemence, &quot;dost thou conceive so little of love as not to know that it sacrifices all--love itself--for the happiness of the thing it loves?
I press this upon you, because I love her, and because I fear that with me her fate will be less fair than with yourself.
The day after his attempt on Viola, his uncle, the Cardinal --, from whom he has large expectations of land and gold, sent for him, and forbade him, on pain of forfeiting all the possessions which his schemes already had parcelled out, to pursue with dishonourable designs one whom the Cardinal had heeded and loved from childhood.
I tell thee again, because a lover is a watcher by night and day; because love never sleeps when danger menaces the beloved one!&quot;
&quot;And yet,&quot; said Zanoni, &quot;if I told thee that I could initiate thee into the secrets of that magic which the philosophy of the whole existing world treats as a chimera, or imposture; if I promised to show thee how to command the beings of air and ocean, how to accumulate wealth more easily than a child can gather pebbles on the shore, to place in thy hands the essence of the herbs which prolong life from age to age, the mystery of that attraction by which to awe all danger and disarm all violence and subdue man as the serpent charms the bird,--if I told thee that all these it was mine to possess and to communicate, thou wouldst listen to me then, and obey me without a doubt!&quot;
No neophyte must have, at his initiation, one affection or desire that chains him to the world.
He must be pure from the love of woman, free from avarice and ambition, free from the dreams even of art, or the hope of earthly fame.
Two loves I have of comfort and despair, Which like two spirits do suggest me still.
The laws of attraction, of electricity, and of the yet more mysterious agency of that great principal of life, which, if drawn from the universe, would leave the universe a grave, were but the code in which the Theurgy of old sought the guides that led it to a legislation and science of its own.
And it stirred in the virgin&#39;s heart,--this new, unfathomable, and divine emotion!
Was it only the ordinary affection of the pulse and the fancy, of the eye to the Beautiful, of the ear to the Eloquent, or did it not justify the notion she herself conceived of it,--that it was born not of the senses, that it was less of earthly and human love than the effect of some wondrous but not unholy charm?
.... &quot;How instantaneously leaped into life the power with which thou swayest my heart in its ebb and flow.
They tell me of love, and my very life of the stage breathes the language of love into my lips.
No; again and again, I know THAT is not the love that I feel for thee!--it is not a passion, it is a thought!
I ask not to be loved again.
I would give worlds, though we were apart, though oceans rolled between us, to know the hour in which thy gaze was lifted to the stars,--in which thy heart poured itself in prayer.
Only thine eyes and thy soft, calm smile haunt me; as when I look upon the moon, all that passes into my heart is her silent light.
They beat with the gladness of the morning wind,--so beats my heart in the freshness and light that make up the thoughts of thee!
.... &quot;Often in my childhood I have mused and asked for what I was born; and my soul answered my heart and said, &#39;THOU WERT BORN TO WORSHIP!&#39;
And then I thought that I should see thee again this day, and so sprung my heart to the new morning which thou bringest me from the skies.
I said, &#39;what to thee this history of the heart of a child?&#39;
&quot;&#39;Viola,&#39; didst thou answer, with that voice, so inexpressibly calm and earnest!--&#39;Viola, the darkness of a child&#39;s heart is often but the shadow of a star.
And musing, thou didst feel that it was not the vine-leaves or the moonlight that made the bird give melody to night, and that the secret of its music was the presence of a thing beloved.&#39;
I startle when I look even at the words I have written; they seem not to come from myself, but are the signs of another language which thou hast taught my heart, and which my hand traces rapidly, as at thy dictation.
.... &quot;Formerly, when I was to appear upon the stage, my heart beat more loudly.
No, it is not love that I feel for thee, Zanoni; or why did I hear thee without anger, why did thy command seem to me not a thing impossible?
As the strings of the instrument obey the hand of the master, thy look modulates the wildest chords of my heart to thy will.
I almost think I could love him, whoever it be, on whom thou wouldst shed the rays that circumfuse thyself.
Whatever thou hast touched, I love; whatever thou speakest of, I love.
Thou seemest to me the source of all love; too high and too bright to be loved thyself, but darting light into other objects, on which the eye can gaze less dazzled.
No, no; it is not love that I feel for thee, and therefore it is that I do not blush to nourish and confess it.
Shame on me if I loved, knowing myself so worthless a thing to thee!
Give me back the careless dreams of my youth,---my liberty of heart that sung aloud as it walked the earth.
Thy kiss still glows upon my hand; is that hand mine to bestow?
Thy kiss claimed and hallowed it to thyself.
Thou art fond of one maxim, which thou repeatest in a thousand forms,--that the beauty of the soul is faith; that as ideal loveliness to the sculptor, faith is to the heart; that faith, rightly understood, extends over all the works of the Creator, whom we can know but through belief; that it embraces a tranquil confidence in ourselves, and a serene repose as to our future; that it is the moonlight that sways the tides of the human sea.
At night I was so sad; not a blossom that had not closed itself up, as if never more to open to the sun; and the night itself, in the heart as on the earth, has ripened the blossoms into flowers.
A Venetian noble might be a fribble, or an assassin,--a scoundrel, or a dolt; worthless, or worse than worthless, yet he might have sat to Titian, and his portrait may be inestimable,--a few inches of painted canvas a thousand times more valuable than a man with his veins and muscles, brain, will, heart, and intellect!
The Neapolitan bowed over the hand he pressed; but as he touched it a shiver came over him, and his heart stood still.
All stratagems fair in love, as in war.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The stern condition on which we hold our nobler and diviner gifts darkens our vision towards the future of those for whom we know the human infirmities of jealousy or hate or love.
Mejnour, all around me is mist and haze; I have gone back in our sublime existence; and from the bosom of the imperishable youth that blooms only in the spirit, springs up the dark poison-flower of human love.
What else to me can be human love?
And in this exquisite nature of hers,--more pure, more spiritual, even in its young affections than ever heretofore the countless volumes of the heart, race after race, have given to my gaze: there is yet a deep-buried feeling that warns me of inevitable woe.
Thou austere and remorseless Hierophant,--thou who hast sought to convert to our brotherhood every spirit that seemed to thee most high and bold,--even thou knowest, by horrible experience, how vain the hope to banish FEAR from the heart of woman.
I pant for a living confidant,--for one who in the old time has himself known jealousy and love.
She had loved the dim and solemn fancies that beset her as she looked into the lengthened gloom of the grotto, or, ascending to the tomb, gazed from the rock on the dwarfed figures of the busy crowd that seemed to creep like insects along the windings of the soil below; and now, at noon, she bent thither her thoughtful way.
&quot;After three months&#39; marriage, there is no different between ugliness and beauty.
If I presume to place myself in the list, it is because I am the only one who loves thee honestly, and woos thee fairly.
Has the Prince di -- ever spoken to thee of marriage; or the beautiful imposter Zanoni, or the young blue-eyed Englishman, Clarence Glyndon?
It is marriage,--it is a home, it is safety, it is reputation, that I offer to thee; and these last when the straight form grows crooked, and the bright eyes dim.
Are you so enamoured of this career that you scorn even to think of security and honour?
She would not reply to his questions; she did not seem to listen to his protestations of love, till suddenly, as Nicot&#39;s terrible picture of the world&#39;s judgment of that profession which to her younger thoughts had seemed the service of Song and the Beautiful, forced itself upon her, she raised her face from her hands, and, looking steadily upon the Englishman, said, &quot;False one, dost thou talk of me of love?&quot;
&quot;By my honour, words fail to tell thee how I love!&quot;
And at that moment, had Glyndon answered as his better angel would have counselled, perhaps, in that revolution of her whole mind which the words of Nicot had effected, which made her despise her very self, sicken of her lofty dreams, despair of the future, and distrust her whole ideal,--perhaps, I say, in restoring her self-esteem,--he would have won her confidence, and ultimately secured her love.
At last, he faltered forth, &quot;Do all of thy profession, beautiful Viola, exact marriage as the sole condition of love?&quot;
was he to be thus mystically cajoled and hurried into a rash marriage, because Zanoni, a mere stranger, told him with a grave face that he must decide before the clock struck a certain hour?
But is it in your love that Zanoni has crossed your path?
He was most touched--touched to the heart, that they liked the macaroni.
The guide was a conversable, garrulous fellow, like most of his country and his calling; and Mervale, who possessed a sociable temper, loved to amuse or to instruct himself on every incidental occasion.
But then, as the minutes passed, and he appeared not, Mervale, whose heart was as good at least as human hearts are in general, grew seriously alarmed.
I know that you have insulted her whom you profess to love.
A fiercer desire than that of love burns in my veins,--the desire not to resemble but to surpass my kind; the desire to penetrate and to share the secret of your own existence--the desire of a preternatural knowledge and unearthly power.
Say!--if I marry Viola, wilt thou be my master,--my guide?
I renounce love.
The love of Viola has vanished from my heart.
A fire, the train of which had been long laid, was lighted at his heart,--the asbestos-fire that, once lit, is never to be quenched.
He had said aright,--LOVE HAD VANISHED FROM HIS HEART; there was no longer a serene space amidst its disordered elements for human affection to move and breathe.
By Heaven, I love thee better than myself, For I came hither armed against myself.
Her thoughts had advanced to that point when the heart recoils from all confidence, and feels that it cannot be comprehended.
Her heart beat violently; but fear gave way to another sentiment when she heard a voice, too well known, calling on her name.
No; but I dare not yet say that I love thee.&quot;
&quot;Thou hast read my heart; thou knowest that thou art become the lord of my destiny.
But to be bound beneath the weight of a cold obligation; to be the beggar on the eyes of indifference; to cast myself on one who loves me not,--THAT were indeed the vilest sin of my sex.
She had thrown back her clustering hair from her face while she spoke; and as she now stood, with her arms drooping mournfully, and her hands clasped together with the proud bitterness of her wayward spirit, giving new zest and charm to her singular beauty, it was impossible to conceive a sight more irresistible to the eye and the heart.
&quot;Come, Viola; believe at least in my friendship, my honour, my protection--&quot; &quot;And not thy love,&quot; said the Italian, turning on him her reproachful eyes.
He felt her heart throbbing beneath his own; her breath came warm upon his cheek.
With a deep and burning sigh, he murmured, &quot;Viola, I love thee!
Months, years passed, and thy sweet face still shone upon my heart.
It is in vain to seek for words to describe the delight--the proud, the full, the complete, and the entire delight--that filled the heart of the Neapolitan.
He whom she had considered too lofty even for love,--more humble to her than those she had half-despised!
She was silent, but her eyes spoke to him; and then slowly, as aware, at last, that the human love had advanced on the ideal, she shrank into the terrors of a modest and virtuous nature.
She did not dare,--she did not dream to ask him the question she had so fearlessly made to Glyndon; but she felt a sudden coldness,--a sense that a barrier was yet between love and love.
said he, tenderly, &quot;and canst thou think that I ask from thee one sacrifice,--still less the greatest that woman can give to love?
As my wife I woo thee, and by every tie, and by every vow that can hallow and endear affection.
they have belied love to thee indeed, if thou dost not know the religion that belongs to it!
They who truly love would seek, for the treasure they obtain, every bond that can make it lasting and secure.
Viola, weep not, unless thou givest me the holy right to kiss away thy tears!&quot;
And that beautiful face, no more averted, drooped upon his bosom; and as he bent down, his lips sought the rosy mouth: a long and burning kiss,--danger, life, the world was forgotten!
Haste, haste; and may love supply the loss of all that it has dared to sacrifice!
Had he escaped unscathed the blades of the foe,--her new treasure, the new light of her life, her lord, at last her lover?
&quot;Fair and cruel one,&quot; said he, advancing with a half-sneer upon his lip, &quot;thou wilt not too harshly blame the violence of love.&quot;
Thy lover, presumptuous though he be, is not by to save thee.
I would fain trust alone to the gentler authorities of affection.
But a truce with this: I loved your grandsire!
He spent the heat of noon in thoughtful solitude, and gradually the image of Viola returned to his heart.
It was the sleeping-chamber of the young actress, that holiest ground to a lover; and well did the place become the presiding deity: none of the tawdry finery of the profession was visible, on the one hand; none of the slovenly disorder common to the humbler classes of the South, on the other.
He had had the power to save the woman he had loved, and had foregone that power; but how was it that in this Zanoni himself had failed?
&quot;No,&quot; said the latter; &quot;hadst thou delayed the acceptance of the Arch-gift until thou hadst attained to the years, and passed through all the desolate bereavements that chilled and seared myself ere my researches had made it mine, thou wouldst have escaped the curse of which thou complainest now,--thou wouldst not have mourned over the brevity of human affection as compared to the duration of thine own existence; for thou wouldst have survived the very desire and dream of the love of woman.
&quot;You mistake,&quot; replied he who had owned the name of Mejnour,--&quot;though I care not for love, and am dead to every PASSION that agitates the sons of clay, I am not dead to their more serene enjoyments.
&quot;And still, then, Mejnour, you cherish the desire to revive our order, limited now to ourselves alone, by new converts and allies.
And you, Zanoni,&quot; continued Mejnour, after a pause,--&quot;you, even you, should this affection for a mortal beauty that you have dared, despite yourself, to cherish, be more than a passing fancy; should it, once admitted into your inmost nature, partake of its bright and enduring essence,--even you may brave all things to raise the beloved one into your equal.
Can you see sickness menace her; danger hover around; years creep on; the eyes grow dim; the beauty fade, while the heart, youthful still, clings and fastens round your own,--can you see this, and know it is yours to--&quot; &quot;Cease!&quot;
&quot;When you told her you loved her,--when you clasped her to your breast, you renounced all power to foresee her future lot, or protect her from harm.
&quot;To-morrow, at this hour, our bark will be bounding over yonder ocean, and the weight of ages will have fallen from my heart!
His immense wealth, his imperious pride, his unscrupulous and daring character, made him an object of no inconsiderable fear to a feeble and timid court; and the ministers of the indolent government willingly connived at excesses which allured him at least from ambition.
It was a long, oval hall, the whole of one side opening by a marble colonnade upon a court or garden, in which the eye rested gratefully upon cool fountains and statues of whitest marble, half-sheltered by orange-trees.
To the Frenchmen, in particular, there was something startling in his intimate knowledge of the minutest events in their own capital and country, and his profound penetration (evinced but in epigrams and sarcasms) into the eminent characters who were then playing a part upon the great stage of continental intrigue.
He mused a moment, and, slipping a piece of gold into the porter&#39;s hand, said that he was commissioned to seek the Signor Zanoni upon an errand of life and death, and easily won his way across the court, and into the interior building.
An Englishman is welcome everywhere; and even were he a Dutchman, your friendship would invest his presence with attraction.
Pledge me in a sentiment, &#39;Long life to the fortunate lover,--a quick release to the baffled suitor&#39;?&quot;
The English are said to love their potations warm and pungent.&quot;
Still the guests stirred not, and still Zanoni continued, with glittering eye and mocking lip, to lavish his stores of intellect and anecdote; when suddenly the moon rose, and shed its rays over the flowers and fountains in the court without, leaving the room itself half in shadow, and half tinged by a quiet and ghostly light.
I remember that in the midst of our clamorous gayety, my eye fell upon the cavalier Signor Zanoni, whose conversation had so enchanted us all; and I felt a certain chill come over me to perceive that he wore the same calm and unsympathising smile upon his countenance which had characterised it in his singular and curious stories of the court of Louis XIV.
He rallied me on some court gossip, which had honoured my name by associating it with a certain beautiful and distinguished Sicilian lady, and affected to treat with contempt that which, had it been true, I should have regarded as a boast.
&#39;He would monopolize all fortune and all love.
She is here, it is true, not by her own choice; he carried her hither by force, but he will pretend that she adores him.
All Naples knows that the Pisani despises at once your gold and your love; that force alone could have brought her under your roof; and that you refuse to produce her, because you fear her complaints, and know enough of the chivalry your vanity sneers at to feel assured that the gentlemen of France are not more disposed to worship beauty than to defend it from wrong.&#39;
And did Zanoni really feel love for Viola?
He no longer reverted to the belief that Zanoni or Viola had sought to dupe him into marriage.
Did he any longer love Viola himself?
No; when that morning he had heard of her danger, he had, it is true, returned to the sympathies and the fears of affection; but with the death of the prince her image faded from his heart, and he felt no jealous pang at the thought that she had been saved by Zanoni,--that at that moment she was perhaps beneath his roof.
&quot;If not,&quot; replied the stranger, &quot;why do you cherish the hope and the wild faith to be yourself a Zanoni?
Young man, if thy imagination is vivid, if thy heart is daring, if thy curiosity is insatiate, I will accept thee as my pupil.
Still, like the wind, he leaves in thy heart the seeds that may bear the blossom and the fruit.
&quot;I give thee, Glyndon,--I give thee no more the option of happy love and serene enjoyment.
But I have ample gifts to bestow upon thee, if thou wilt abandon the hope that gnaws thy heart, and the realisation of which even _I_ have not the power to foresee.
Men desire four things in life,--love, wealth, fame, power.
For this, and for this alone, I surrendered the love of Viola; this, and this alone, must be my recompense.&quot;
Glyndon turned, and his heart beat when he perceived that the stranger, whose footsteps he had not heard upon the pebbles, whose approach he had not beheld in the moonlight, was once more by his side.
He strove to answer; but the voice touched a chord at his heart, and the words failed him.
Thou hast decided thine own career; thou hast renounced love; thou hast rejected wealth, fame, and the vulgar pomps of power.
Around this spot, which, in the heart of a Christian land, retained the vestige of the old idolatry (for just such were the chapels that in the pagan age were dedicated to the demon-saints of mythology), gathered six or seven miserable and squalid wretches, whom the curse of the leper had cut off from mankind.
Glyndon&#39;s heart somewhat failed him as he looked around, and the question he desired to ask died upon his lips.
&quot;Why, signor,&quot; said the bravo, with a gay laugh, &quot;hermits of my class seldom love the confessional.
With that the robber, as if he loved permission to talk at his will, hemmed thrice, and began with much humour; though, as his tale proceeded, the memories it roused seemed to carry him farther than he at first intended, and reckless and light-hearted ease gave way to that fierce and varied play of countenance and passion of gesture which characterise the emotions of his countrymen.
Of course there could be no marriage in the case; and when I was born, the monk gravely declared my appearance to be miraculous.
So, instead of spoiling parchment, I made love to the notary&#39;s daughter.
But my Ninetta loved me, and took care that I should not lie out in the streets with the Lazzaroni.
Her father found her an excellent marriage in the person of a withered old picture-dealer.
She took the spouse, and very properly clapped the door in the face of the lover.
At last old Bilboa got uppermost; out flashed his knife; down it came, but not in my heart.
They wanted to pistol the captain, but that was against my laws: so we gagged him, for he scolded as loud as if we were married to him; left him and the rest of his crew on board our own vessel, which was terribly battered; clapped our black flag on the Frenchman&#39;s, and set off merrily, with a brisk wind in our favour.
my fate would have it that I should fall in love with a silk-mercer&#39;s daughter.
Ah, how I loved her!--the pretty Clara!
Yes, I loved her so well that I was seized with horror at my past life!
I resolved to repent, to marry her, and settle down into an honest man.
Had I married Clara, I had been as gentle a mercer as ever handled a measure.&quot;
I, soft soul, would not commit another crime to gain my bread, for Clara was still at my heart with her sweet eyes; so, limiting my rogueries to the theft of a beggar&#39;s rags, which I compensated by leaving him my galley attire instead, I begged my way to the town where I left Clara.
She had died, perhaps of love, more likely of shame.
A road which had once been broad and paved with rough flags, but which now was half-obliterated by long grass and rank weeds, conducted to the outer court of the castle hard by; the gates were open, and half the building in this part was dismantled; the ruins partially hid by ivy that was the growth of centuries.
But on entering the inner court, Glyndon was not sorry to notice that there was less appearance of neglect and decay; some wild roses gave a smile to the grey walls, and in the centre there was a fountain in which the waters still trickled coolly, and with a pleasing murmur, from the jaws of a gigantic Triton.
For several days Mejnour refused to confer with Glyndon on the subjects nearest to his heart.
What we call the heart appeared to have merged into the intellect.
&quot;Your ancestor attained that secret; he died rather than survive the only thing he loved.
As a patient on whom, slowly and by degrees, the agencies of mesmerism are brought to bear, he acknowledged to his heart the growing force of that vast and universal magnetism which is the life of creation, and binds the atom to the whole.
A mortal cold struck to the Englishman&#39;s heart, and his blood froze.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Mejnour passed his hand over the young man&#39;s heart,--it beat loud, regularly, and boldly.
answered Glyndon, in his heart; but he felt that his lips moved not.
Zanoni was seated on a fragment of stone; Viola, half-reclining by his side, was looking into his face, which was bent down to her, and in her countenance was the expression of that perfect happiness which belongs to perfect love.
&quot;Because the heart is never ignorant; because the mysteries of the feelings are as full of wonder as those of the intellect.
&quot;For the enigmas are but love&#39;s common language, and love should solve them.
&quot;And yet,&quot; she continued, &quot;I am now assured of what I at first believed,--that the feelings which attracted me towards thee at first were not those of love.
But shall we not grow old together, and our eyes be accustomed to a change which the heart shall not share!&quot;
&quot;But were it so,&quot; muttered Zanoni; and then looking steadfastly at Viola, he said, with a half-smile, &quot;Hast thou no curiosity to learn more of the lover thou once couldst believe the agent of the Evil One?&quot;
&quot;None; all that one wishes to know of the beloved one, I know--THAT THOU LOVEST ME!&quot;
All these men (they were great dreamers, as you desire to be) were intimate friends of mine.
Like orators whom I have heard, when I stood by the Pnyx of Athens, blazing with words like comets in the assembly, and extinguishing their ardour like holiday rockets when they were in the field.
But if thou art so enamoured of life as to care only to live on, no matter for what ends, recruiting the nerves and veins with the alchemist&#39;s vivifying elixir, why seek these dangers from the intermediate tribes?
This sudden picture of easy joy and careless ignorance, contrasting so forcibly with the intense studies and that parching desire for wisdom which had so long made up his own life, and burned at his own heart, sensibly affected Glyndon.
The flitting forms of the women in their picturesque attire, their happy laughter ringing through the cool, still air of the autumn noon, brought back to the heart, or rather perhaps to the senses, the images of his past time, the &quot;golden shepherd hours,&quot; when to live was but to enjoy.
Glyndon was about to reply to this salutation, when his eyes rested upon the face of a young girl leaning on Paolo&#39;s arm, of a beauty so attractive that his colour rose and his heart beat as he encountered her gaze.
And that rosy, pursed-up mouth that will answer so sparingly to thy flatteries, as if words were a waste of time, and kisses were their proper language.
No; but to enjoy, to love, to revel!
There is attraction in the elementary principle of light.
As he locked the door, he still heard the dying strain of that fairy music; and with a light step and a joyous heart he repaired to Paolo, inly resolving to visit again the chamber at an hour when his experiment would be safe from interruption.
Youth without love and pleasure!
&quot;Ah, Excellency, while we are young, nothing like adventure,--except love, wine, and laughter!&quot;
And do you really love me?&quot;
&quot;With my whole heart!&quot;
Perhaps Glyndon had never really loved Viola; perhaps the feelings with which she had inspired him were not of that ardent character which deserves the name of love.
However that be, he thought, as he gazed on those dark eyes, that he had never loved before.
With you, love is amusement; with us, it is life.
We love ardently; we own it boldly.
Dost thou love me now?&quot;
Mejnour with his austere wisdom,--Mejnour the enemy to love; Mejnour, whose eye will read thy heart, and refuse thee the promised secrets because the sunny face of Fillide disturbs the lifeless shadow that he calls repose,--Mejnour comes to-morrow!
A flame of silvery and azure tints sprung up from each, and lighted the apartment with a calm and yet most dazzling splendour; but presently this light grew more soft and dim, as a thin, grey cloud, like a mist, gradually spread over the room; and an icy thrill shot through the heart of the Englishman, and quickly gathered over him like the coldness of death.
Am I not thy beloved?
Kiss me, my mortal lover.&quot;
For there the prodigal beauty yet seems half to justify those graceful superstitions of a creed that, too enamoured of earth, rather brought the deities to man, than raised the man to their less alluring and less voluptuous Olympus.
The loving sky and the lovely earth are companions enough to Wisdom and to Ignorance while they love.
He loved to roam alone, chiefly at dawn, or at night, when the moon was clear (especially in each month, at its rise and full), miles and miles away over the rich inlands of the island, and to cull herbs and flowers, which he hoarded with jealous care.
Every spot of the Greek soil, &quot;that fair Fable-Land,&quot; seemed to him familiar; and as he conversed of the past and its exquisite traditions, he taught Viola to love the race from which have descended the poetry and the wisdom of the world.
His love for herself was so tender, so vigilant, and had that best and most enduring attribute, that it seemed rather grateful for the happiness in its own cares than vain of the happiness it created.
How different--how cold--to the rapture of hanging on thy smile, and listening to thy voice, when it says, &#39;I love thee!&#39;&quot;
How is it that they then stirred thy fancies and filled thy heart?
Is it common life, then, to love, and to live with the one we love?
And so night surprised them by the lonely beach; and Zanoni, allured from his sublimer projects, and bending over that tender face, forgot that, in the Harmonious Infinite which spread around, there were other worlds than that one human heart.
Now thou hast bound thyself back to the earth by its strongest chains, and the attraction to the clay is more potent than the sympathies that drew to thy charms the Dweller of the Starbeam and the Air.
I love; and in love I begin to live in the sweet humanities of another.
If wise, yet in all which makes danger powerless against myself, or those on whom I can gaze from the calm height of indifferent science, I am blind as the merest mortal to the destinies of the creature that makes my heart beat with the passions which obscure my gaze.&quot;
&quot;Thy love must be but a mockery of the name; thou canst not love as they do for whom there are death and the grave.
Because in her soul all is love.
Their attraction is but to the desires and cravings of the INTELLECT.
But to these have only been vouchsafed partial secrets; vanity and passion unfitted them for the rest; and now, without other interest than that of an experiment in science, without love, and without pity, thou exposest this new soul to the hazards of the tremendous ordeal!
Either must I be drawn down to the nature of the beloved, or hers must be lifted to my own.
As whatever belongs to true Art has always necessarily had attraction for US, whose very being is in the ideal whence Art descends, so in this fair creature I have learned, at last, the secret that bound me to her at the first glance.
At last came love; and there, as a river into the sea, it poured its restless waves, to become mute and deep and still,--the everlasting mirror of the heavens.
And is not the POET, who studies nothing but the human heart, a greater philosopher than all?
Deeming myself not pure enough to initiate so pure a heart, I invoke to her trance those fairest and most tender inhabitants of space that have furnished to poetry, which is the instinctive guess into creation, the ideas of the Glendoveer and Sylph.
And these were less pure than her own thoughts, and less tender than her own love!
They could not raise her above her human heart, for THAT has a heaven of its own.
that which is so sweet to others has its bitterness to me; for I think how soon the time may come when that sleep will be without a dream,--when the heart that dictates the name will be cold, and the lips that utter it be dumb.
What a twofold shape there is in love!
If we examine it coarsely,--if we look but on its fleshy ties, its enjoyments of a moment, its turbulent fever and its dull reaction,--how strange it seems that this passion should be the supreme mover of the world; that it is this which has dictated the greatest sacrifices, and influenced all societies and all times; that to this the loftiest and loveliest genius has ever consecrated its devotion; that, but for love, there were no civilisation, no music, no poetry, no beauty, no life beyond the brute&#39;s.
But examine it in its heavenlier shape,--in its utter abnegation of self; in its intimate connection with all that is most delicate and subtle in the spirit,--its power above all that is sordid in existence; its mastery over the idols of the baser worship; its ability to create a palace of the cottage, an oasis in the desert, a summer in the Iceland,--where it breathes, and fertilises, and glows; and the wonder rather becomes how so few regard it in its holiest nature.
True love is less a passion than a symbol.
Since I have loved her, Mejnour, it seems almost cowardice to elude the grave which devours the hearts that wrap us in their folds.
But I cherish the same desire, with a warmer heart.
The initiation is deferred,--thy days and nights are left to no other visions than those with which a contented heart enchants a guileless fancy.
A presentiment she could not define made her heart beat more quickly; and, looking into his face, she was struck with its expression: it was anxious, abstracted, perturbed.
Strange crisis in the life of woman, and in her love!
Something yet unborn begins already to divide her heart with that which had been before its only monarch.
Oh, lover,--oh, husband!&quot;
He kissed the tears from her eyes, but made no answer.
But no, thou didst not love the giver as thou dost me.
said Zanoni, tenderly; &quot;she who placed this round my neck deemed it indeed a charm, for she had superstitions like thyself; but to me it is more than the wizard&#39;s spell,--it is the relic of a sweet vanished time when none who loved me could distrust.&quot;
He said these words in a tone of such melancholy reproach that it went to the heart of Viola; but the tone changed into a solemnity which chilled back the gush of her feelings as he resumed: &quot;And this, Viola, one day, perhaps, I will transfer from my breast to thine; yes, whenever thou shalt comprehend me better,--WHENEVER THE LAWS OF OUR BEING SHALL BE THE SAME!&quot;
They returned slowly home; but fear still was in the heart of Viola, though she strove to shake it off.
Who shall say that the heart does not change with the scene,--the place where we first dwelt with the beloved one?
If a thought less kind, less trustful, enter within us, the sight of a tree under which a vow has been exchanged, a tear has been kissed away, restores us again to the hours of the first divine illusion.
But in a home where nothing speaks of the first nuptials, where there is no eloquence of association, no holy burial-places of emotions, whose ghosts are angels!--yes, who that has gone through the sad history of affection will tell us that the heart changes not with the scene!
From afar now gleam in the moonlight the columns, yet extant, of a temple which the Athenian dedicated to wisdom; and, standing on the bark that bounded on in the freshening gale, the votary who had survived the goddess murmured to himself,-- &quot;Has the wisdom of ages brought me no happier hours than those common to the shepherd and the herdsman, with no world beyond their village, no aspiration beyond the kiss and the smile of home?&quot;
Thy desire for knowledge, but petulant presumption; thy thirst for happiness, but the diseased longing for the unclean and muddied waters of corporeal pleasure; thy very love, which usually elevates even the mean, a passion that calculates treason amidst the first glow of lust.
Thy heart, amidst vulgar joys will aspire to something holier; thy ambition, amidst coarse excitement, to something beyond thy reach.
A sort of stupor succeeded to the various emotions which had chased each other in the perusal,--a stupor resembling that which follows the sudden destruction of any ardent and long-nursed hope in the human heart, whether it be of love, of avarice, of ambition.
Had not Zanoni himself confessed love for Viola; had he not fled with her as his companion?
Glyndon never paused to consider if there are no distinctions between one kind of love and another.
&quot;I wish, signor, now the Padrone is gone,--not,&quot; added Paolo, as he cast rather a frightened and suspicious glance round the room, &quot;that I mean to say anything disrespectful of him,--I wish, I say, now that he is gone, that you would take pity on yourself, and ask your own heart what your youth was meant for?
It was the easiest thing in the world for Mervale, on returning from his Continental episode of life, to settle down to his desk,--his heart had been always there.
He had lately married, not entirely for money,--no!
He had no romantic ideas of love; but he was too sensible a man not to know that a wife should be a companion,--not merely a speculation.
He chose a wife from his reason, not his heart, and a very good choice he made.
Mrs. Mervale was an excellent young woman,--bustling, managing, economical, but affectionate and good.
She held in abhorrence all levity, all flirtation, all coquetry,--small vices which often ruin domestic happiness, but which a giddy nature incurs without consideration.
But she did not think it right to love a husband over much.
She left a surplus of affection, for all her relations, all her friends, some of her acquaintances, and the possibility of a second marriage, should any accident happen to Mr. M. She kept a good table, for it suited their station; and her temper was considered even, though firm; but she could say a sharp thing or two, if Mr. Mervale was not punctual to a moment.
&quot;I hope, my love, that none of my relations are unwelcome visitors at your house.
&quot;Sir,&quot; said Mrs. Mervale, launching a premeditated sentence with more than Johnsonian dignity, &quot;permit me to remind you that Mr. Mervale is now a married man, the destined father of a family, and the present master of a household.&quot;
I myself have a great mind to marry.
The friends walked into the streets, and Mervale shrank from the irony with which Glyndon complimented him on his respectability, his station, his pursuits, his happy marriage, and his eight pictures in their handsome frames.
he exclaimed, &quot;how right you were to tell me to marry respectably; to have a solid position; to live in decorous fear of the world and one&#39;s wife; and to command the envy of the poor, the good opinion of the rich.
All at once he abandoned the decorous and formal society he had courted; he joined himself, with young and riotous associates; he plunged into the wildest excesses of the great city, where Gold reigns alike over Toil and Pleasure.
In the early years of hope and home he had loved this girl, much younger than himself, with all a brother&#39;s tenderness.
She recalled herself to him on her aunt&#39;s death by a touching and melancholy letter: she had now no home but his,--no dependence save on his affection; he wept when he read it, and was impatient till Adela arrived.
This girl, then about eighteen, concerned beneath a gentle and calm exterior much of the romance or enthusiasm that had, at her own age, characterised her brother.
She differed from him especially in a timidity of character which exceeded that usual at her age, but which the habit of self-command concealed no less carefully than that timidity itself concealed the romance I have ascribed to her.
Though, as I have said, not handsome, her countenance was interesting and pleasing; and there was that caressing kindness, that winning charm about her smile, her manners, her anxiety to please, to comfort, and to soothe which went at once to the heart, and made her lovely,--because so loving.
The delicate and generous and respectful affection of her brother was no less new to her than delightful.
It is not surprising, then, that this young creature, free and virgin from every more ardent attachment, concentrated all her grateful love on this cherished and protecting relative.
Her study by day, her dream by night, was to repay him for his affection.
Too wrapped in his own strange existence to be acutely observant of the character of others, Glyndon mistook the self-content of a generous and humble affection for constitutional fortitude; and this quality pleased and soothed him.
How often the lonely man thought to himself, &quot;My heart would be lightened of its misery, if once confessed!&quot;
&quot;I was not alone, but the associate of my wanderings was not one in whom my soul could confide,--faithful and affectionate, but without education, without faculties to comprehend me, with natural instincts rather than cultivated reason; one in whom the heart might lean in its careless hours, but with whom the mind could have no commune, in whom the bewildered spirit could seek no guide.
I know not why it was, but their licentious language infected myself; and, always desirous to be foremost in every circle, I soon exceeded even these rioters in declamations on the nature of the liberty which was about to embrace all the families of the globe,--a liberty that should pervade not only public legislation, but domestic life; an emancipation from every fetter that men had forged for themselves.
Opinion without persecution; brotherhood without jealousy; love without bondage--&#39; &quot;&#39;And life without God,&#39; added the mask as I hesitated for new images.
I left all whom I had before courted and clung to,--I came hither.
And in this love so pure, so holy, thy terror shall fade away.&quot;
But what chilled him, if possible, yet more than her wasting form and trembling nerves, was the change in her love for him; a natural terror had replaced it.
Say that thou didst not desert me from the love of another; say it again,--say it ever!--and I will pardon thee all the rest!&quot;
&quot;And he would have married me if I would!--divorced his wife to marry me!
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>It must have been in the course of the year 1791 when Viola fled from Naples with her mysterious lover, and when Glyndon sought Mejnour in the fatal castle.
The hum of the Rialto was hushed,--the last loiterers had deserted the Place of St. Mark&#39;s, and only at distant intervals might be heard the oars of the rapid gondolas, bearing reveller or lover to his home.
Though beneath thine eyes thousands have perished; though, where they burn, spring up the foul poisons of the human heart, and to those whom thou canst subject to thy will, thy presence glares in the dreams of the raving maniac, or blackens the dungeon of despairing crime, thou art not my vanquisher, but my slave!&quot;
Hark, the wail of women!--hark, the sharp shriek of thy beloved one!
And Zanoni heard distinctly in his heart, even at that distance from the chamber, the voice of Viola calling in delirium on her beloved one.
exclaimed the seer, passionately; &quot;my love for thee has made me powerless!&quot;
In the dark chamber lay Viola, in the sharpest agonies of travail; life seemed rending itself away in the groans and cries that spoke of pain in the midst of frenzy; and still, in groan and cry, she called on Zanoni, her beloved.
Husband, thy wife lives; lover, thy universe is no solitude!
joy!--father, embrace thy child!
.... Viola recovered with a rapidity that startled the physician; and the young stranger thrived as if it already loved the world to which it had descended.
In its very repose it seemed to be listening to some happy voice within its heart: it seemed itself so happy.
But Zanoni, wrapped in the sublime designs that animated the human love to which he was now awakened, forgot all, even all he had forfeited or incurred, in the love that blinded him.
Answer me, Mejnour, for in the darkness that veils me, I see only the pure eyes of the new-born; I hear only the low beating of my heart.
Answer me, thou whose wisdom is without love!
When, at the primary grades of initiation, the pupil I took from thee on the shores of the changed Parthenope, fell senseless and cowering before that Phantom-Darkness, I knew that his spirit was not formed to front the worlds beyond; for FEAR is the attraction of man to earthiest earth, and while he fears, he cannot soar.
But THOU, seest thou not that to love is but to fear; seest thou not that the power of which thou boastest over the malignant one is already gone?
If there can yet be sufficient sympathy between us, through MY eyes shalt thou see, and perhaps guard against the perils that, shapeless yet, and looming through the shadow, marshal themselves around thee and those whom thy very love has doomed.
But first parting is always more melancholy than it need be: it seems an interruption to the existence which Love shares with Love; it makes the heart feel what a void life will be when the last parting shall succeed, as succeed it must, the first.
A few days,--every hour of which seems an era to the infant, over whom bend watchful the eyes and the heart.
Solitude, serenity, the struggling desires after peace and virtue,--THESE were the elements it loved to haunt!
Bewildered, terror-stricken, the wild account confirmed by the dim impressions that never, in the depth and confidence of affection, had been closely examined, but rather banished as soon as felt,--that the life and attributes of Zanoni were not like those of mortals,--impressions which her own love had made her hitherto censure as suspicions that wronged, and which, thus mitigated, had perhaps only served to rivet the fascinated chains in which he bound her heart and senses, but which now, as Glyndon&#39;s awful narrative filled her with contagious dread, half unbound the very spells they had woven before,--Viola started up in fear, not for HERSELF, and clasped her child in her arms!
In return for all my love for thee and thine, dost thou distrust me, at the first sentence of a maniac who accuses?&quot;
Didst thou not foresee that, until the ordeal was past, there could be no equality between thy wisdom and her love?
Dost thou not know that Fear and Distrust, once sown in the heart of Love, spring up from the seed into a forest that excludes the stars?
With Glyndon&#39;s terror she felt a sympathy, against which her reason and her love struggled in vain.
The good father, a worthy and pious man, but with little education and less sense, one who held (as many of the lower Italians do to this day) even a poet to be a sort of sorcerer, seemed to shut the gates of hope upon her heart.
But Viola, as untutored as himself, was terrified by his rough and vehement eloquence,--terrified, for by that penetration which Catholic priests, however dull, generally acquire, in their vast experience of the human heart hourly exposed to their probe, Bartolomeo spoke less of danger to herself than to her child.
The chamber which, in that and every house they had inhabited, even that in the Greek isles, Zanoni had set apart to a solitude on which none might intrude, the threshold of which even Viola&#39;s step was forbid to cross, and never, hitherto, in that sweet repose of confidence which belongs to contented love, had she even felt the curious desire to disobey,--now, that chamber drew her towards it.
The monads that make up space and air seemed charged with a spiritual attraction,--to become a medium through which her spirit could pass from its clay, and confer with the spirit to which the unutterable desire compelled it.
Its temperature gradually diminished, and, becoming contracted by cooling, the rotation increased in rapidity, and zones of nebulosity were successively thrown off, in consequence of the centrifugal force overpowering the central attraction.
O lover!
O still worshipped and adored!
if thou hast ever loved me, if thou canst still pity, seek not to discover the steps that fly thee.
Zanoni, I will rear it to love thee, to call thee father!
No; thou, the wisely-terrible, canst divine what the hand trembles to record; and while I shudder at thy power,--while it is thy power I fly (our child upon my bosom),--it comforts me still to think that thy power can read the heart!
Because, if thou wert sorcerer or angel-demon, there was no peril to other but myself: and none to me, for my love was my heavenliest part; and my ignorance in all things, except the art to love thee, repelled every thought that was not bright and glorious as thine image to my eyes.
But never yet, from nobler and purer motives of self-sacrifice, did human love link itself to another, than did the forsaking wife now abandon the absent.
But what bitter doubt of her own conduct, what icy pang of remorse shot through her heart, when, as they rested for a few hours on the road to Leghorn, she heard the woman who accompanied herself and Glyndon pray for safety to reach her husband&#39;s side, and strength to share the perils that would meet her there!
She shrunk into the darkness of her own heart,--and then no voice from within consoled her.
Abandon thine idle hope of the love of woman.
unveiling all our secrets, piercing space and traversing worlds!--Mejnour, what awful learning lies hid in the ignorance of the heart that loves!&quot;
&quot;The heart,&quot; answered the mystic, coldly; &quot;ay, for five thousand years I have ransacked the mysteries of creation, but I have not yet discovered all the wonders in the heart of the simplest boor!&quot;
Icy sage, there is no self in love!
I want now no other guide but the human instincts of affection.
Though mine art fail me; though the stars heed me not; though space, with its shining myriads, is again to me but the azure void,--I return but to love and youth and hope!
But so much the greater is my merit if I disdain these excesses of the ease or the pride, since I love the elegant, and have a taste!
Such was the man who had resigned a judicial appointment (the early object of his ambition) rather than violate his philanthropical principles by subscribing to the death of a single fellow-creature; such was the virgin enemy to capital punishments; and such, Butcher-Dictator now, was the man whose pure and rigid manners, whose incorruptible honesty, whose hatred of the excesses that tempt to love and wine, would, had he died five years earlier, have left him the model for prudent fathers and careful citizens to place before their sons.
Such was the man who seemed to have no vice, till circumstance, that hotbed, brought forth the two which, in ordinary times, lie ever the deepest and most latent in a man&#39;s heart,--Cowardice and Envy.
Faithful fellows, how they love me!
&quot;Dear Payan, it is not the love,--it is the philosophy that charms me.
What noble sentiments!--what ardour of virtue!
The address, drawn up most probably by Payan (Thermidor 9), after the arrest of Robespierre, thus mentions his crippled colleague: &quot;Couthon, ce citoyen vertueux, QUI N&#39;A QUE LE COEUR ET LA TETE DE VIVANS, mais qui les a brulants de patriotisme&quot; (Couthon, that virtuous citizen, who has but the head and the heart of the living, yet possesses these all on flame with patriotism.
&quot;Nay,--do not say that it is not the LOVE that attracts thee; it IS the love!
the sublime affection for the whole human race, and indeed, for all that lives!&quot;
And Citizen Couthon, bending down, fondled the little spaniel that he invariably carried in his bosom, even to the Convention, as a vent for the exuberant sensibilities which overflowed his affectionate heart.
Ah, it is THAT which pierces the heart!
To be an object of terror to the enemies of our country,--THAT is noble; but to be an object of terror to the good, the patriotic, to those one loves and reveres,--THAT is the most terrible of human tortures at least, to a susceptible and honest heart!&quot;
&quot;How I love to hear him!&quot;
He may hate YOU, but he loves MONEY!&quot;
This hand, which thine eyes shall search in vain to discover, shall pierce thy heart.
And when (for Camille Desmoulins had a heart, which seemed dead or dormant in most of his contemporaries) that vivid child of genius and of error, shocked at the massacre of the Girondins, and repentant of his own efforts against them, began to rouse the serpent malice of Robespierre by new doctrines of mercy and toleration, Glyndon espoused his views with his whole strength and soul.
&quot;And yet,&quot; said Nicot, apparently not heeding the reply, and as if musingly to himself, &quot;it is strange to think that the butcher is as mortal as the butchered; that his life hangs on as slight a thread; that between the cuticle and the heart there is as short a passage,--that, in short, one blow can free France and redeem mankind!&quot;
Oh, Glyndon, by our old friendship, by our common art, by thy loyal English faith and good English heart, let me share thy flight!&quot;
&quot;Ah,--remember, yes!--and the lover with whom she fled.&quot;
The love of an uneducated, violent, unprincipled woman, opens with a heaven, to merge in a hell!
But come what may, I will not so basely desert one who, with all her errors, trusted her fate to my love.&quot;
&quot;True; but I left her in safety, and I did not then believe her love to be so deep and faithful.
&quot;Does he love this girl still?&quot;
He loves her.
And Fillide, I love her: and thy gold, I love THAT more!
He is not jealous of the ugly Nicot!--ha, ha!--yet Nicot loved thee well once, when his fortunes were more fair.
Who is this woman whom thy friend visits,--and does he love her?&quot;
But what if he does love a rival; what if he betrays thee; what if, wearied by thy jealousies, he designs in his flight to leave thee behind,--would such knowledge make thee happier?&quot;
Oh, thou knowest not how sweet is hatred to those who have really loved!&quot;
&quot;One condition more: thy lover designs to fly with his new love, to leave thee to thy fate; if I prove this to thee, and if I give thee revenge against thy rival, wilt thou fly with me?
I love thee!--I will wed thee!&quot;
Nicot felt he had gone too far; and with that knowledge of the evil part of our nature which his own heart and association with crime had taught him, he resolved to trust the rest to the passions of the Italian, when raised to the height to which he was prepared to lead them.
&quot;Pardon me,&quot; he said; &quot;my love made me too presumptuous; and yet it is only that love,--my sympathy for thee, beautiful and betrayed, that can induce me to wrong, with my revelations, one whom I have regarded as a brother.
Young Louis, the monarch and the lover, was victor of the Tournament at the Carousel; and all France felt herself splendid in the splendour of her gorgeous chief!
I have just returned from their courts of justice,--dens where tigers arraign their prey.
But here, from my tower of time, looking over the darksome past, and into the starry future, I learn how great hearts feel what sweetness and glory there is to die for the things they love!
And some of these young hearts had loved, and even, though in struggles, loved yet.
Did even love allure them?
Dost thou not feel the beating of my heart through the veil of thy rosy slumbers?
Those eyes of horror were gnawing into his heart.
Thou whom the sweet humanities of love shut out even from the dreams of aerial and spiritual beauty, making thy heart a universe of visions fairer than the wanderer over the rosy Hesperus can survey,--shall not the same pure affection encompass thee, even here, with a charmed atmosphere, and terror itself fall harmless on a life too innocent for wisdom?
Black Henriot flies here and there, muttering to his armed troops, &quot;Robespierre, your beloved, is in danger!&quot;
In a small chamber, in the heart of the city, sits the mother, watching over her child.
Lifted to the higher realm of passionate love, it seemed as if the fictitious genius which represents the thoughts of others was merged in the genius that grows all thought itself.
In its sleep there was that slumber, so deep and rigid, which a thunderbolt could not have disturbed; and in such sleep often it moved its arms, as to embrace the air: often its lips stirred with murmured sounds of indistinct affection,--NOT FOR HER; and all the while upon its cheeks a hue of such celestial bloom, upon its lips a smile of such mysterious joy!
Never had Viola felt before how mighty was her love for Zanoni; how thought, feeling, heart, soul, life,--all lay crushed and dormant in the icy absence to which she had doomed herself!
Glyndon paused for a few moments, and gazed with strange and mingled feelings upon that face and form, still so young, and yet so invested with that saddest of all repose,--when the heart feels old.
Ah, why then did you refuse my love; or why was mine not worthy of you?
No passion so sweet as that youthful love can return to me again.
Viola listened, but scarcely comprehended; he pressed her hand to his heart and departed.
is but permission to love thee.
But when she there, looking up to the dull building, saw the windows of the room which the belief of Glyndon&#39;s love had once made a paradise, the tiger relented at the heart; something of the woman gushed back upon her nature, dark and savage as it was.
He would repair whatever errors he had committed against her, by the self-immolation of marriage with one little congenial with himself.
He who had once revolted from marriage with the noble and gentle Viola!--he had learned in that world of wrong to know that right is right, and that Heaven did not make the one sex to be the victim of the other.
But, monster though he was, when his murderous fingers griped the throat of his benefactor, Time, and that ferment of all evil passions--the Reign of Blood--had made in the deep hell of his heart a deeper still.
The old Marquise, who, like Catherine Theot, called him &quot;son,&quot; really seemed to love him piously and disinterestedly as a mother; and as she peeled the oranges, and heaped on him the most caressing and soothing expressions, the livid ghost of a smile fluttered about his meagre lips.
Robespierre waved his hand impatiently; and the old woman, with a sigh, patted his pale cheek, kissed his forehead, and submissively withdrew.
The woman whom he loves--Teresa de Fontenai--who lies in prison, still continues to correspond with him; to urge him to save her by thy destruction: this my listeners overheard.
Hast thou--hast thou--&quot; And the tyrant, as he spoke, opened and shut both his hands, as if already grasping the lives of the writers, and one of those convulsive grimaces that seemed like an epileptic affection, to which he was subject, distorted his features.
I loved him once; I never loved them!
Bold as he was, an icy chill shot through his heart, he knew too well the tremendous system that then reigned in Paris not to be aware of his danger.
He breathed hard, he heard distinctly the loud beating of his heart.

<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Did I not tell thee that the ordeal was one of awful hazard and tremendous fears,--nay, did I not offer to resign to thee the heart that was mighty enough, while mine, Glyndon, to content me?
but to cherish and direct them to worthy ends.
They fancied an affinity existing among all the works of Nature, and that in the lowliest lay the secret attraction that might conduct them upward to the loftiest.
And if they sought, and at last discovered, how to the eye of the Spirit all the subtler modifications of being and of matter might be made apparent; if they discovered how, for the wings of the Spirit, all space might be annihilated, and while the body stood heavy and solid here, as a deserted tomb, the freed IDEA might wander from star to star,--if such discoveries became in truth their own, the sublimest luxury of their knowledge was but this, to wonder, to venerate, and adore!
Canst thou think that it is no sorrow, either to reject all human ties, all friendship, and all love, or to see, day after day, friendship and love wither from our life, as blossoms from the stem?
And now, that thou mayest be contented that the secrets are not vouchsafed to thee, learn that so utterly must the idea detach itself from what makes up the occupation and excitement of men; so must it be void of whatever would covet, or love, or hate,--that for the ambitious man, for the lover, the hater, the power avails not.
and calm, on the childlike heart, smile again, O azure Heaven, with thy night and thy morning star but as one, though under its double name of Memory and Hope!&quot;
Think no more of the sensual love that lured, and wellnigh lost thee.
But he is still so beloved by his mobs,--still so supported by his Jacobins: better delay open hostilities till the hour is more ripe.
said the visitor to him, and the very sound of his voice went straight to the heart,--&quot;your servant is arrested in the streets.
&quot;A man like you, who would save the woman he loves.&quot;
Doubtless, truth has its power, its rage, its despotism, its accents, touching, terrible, which resound in the pure heart as in the guilty conscience; and which Falsehood can no more imitate than Salmoneus could forge the thunderbolts of Heaven.
It was necessary to soothe a wronged and ulcerated heart.
They spoke to his heart as the trumpet speaks to the war-horse.
All shall be love and brotherhood; and--ho!
To-morrow, eighty heads, and hers whose pillow has been thy heart!
The Seine, in its slow waters, yet trembles with the last kiss of the rosy day; and still in the blue sky gleams the spire of Notre Dame; and still in the blue sky looms the guillotine by the Barriere du Trone.
In the intense desire and anguish of his heart, perhaps, lay a power not yet called forth; for who has not felt that the sharpness of extreme grief cuts and grinds away many of those strongest bonds of infirmity and doubt which bind down the souls of men to the cabined darkness of the hour; and that from the cloud and thunderstorm often swoops the Olympian eagle that can ravish us aloft!
Thy life has left thee, to live in the heart of a daughter of the charnel and the worm.
Happy for thee hadst thou mourned over the deaths which come by the gentle hand of Nature,--hadst thou never known how the name of mother consecrates the face of Beauty, and never, bending over thy first-born, felt the imperishable sweetness of a father&#39;s love!
They are saved, for what?--the mother, for the death of violence and shame and blood, for the doomsman&#39;s hand to put aside that shining hair which has entangled thy bridegroom kisses; the child, first and last of thine offspring, in whom thou didst hope to found a race that should hear with thee the music of celestial harps, and float, by the side of thy familiar, Adon-Ai, through the azure rivers of joy,--the child, to live on a few days as a fungus in a burial-vault, a thing of the loathsome dungeon, dying of cruelty and neglect and famine.
thou who wouldst baffle Death, learn how the deathless die if they dare to love the mortal.
Now I seize and wrap thee with the pestilence of my presence; now, evermore, till thy long race is run, mine eyes shall glow into thy brain, and mine arms shall clasp thee, when thou wouldst take the wings of the Morning and flee from the embrace of Night!&quot;
The soul that loves can dare all things.
As the heavenly visitor stood in the atmosphere of his own lustre, and looked upon the face of the Theurgist with an aspect of ineffable tenderness and love, all space seemed lighted from his smile.
Over the world, as a million times swifter than light, than electricity, the Son of Glory had sped his way to the side of love, his wings had scattered delight as the morning scatters dew.
In the dungeon and on the scaffold looks everlasting the Eye of HIM, tenderer than thou to love, wiser than thou to guide, mightier than thou to save!&quot;
Then towards the Garden of the Star Lift up thine aspect warm with love, And, friendlike link&#39;d through space afar, Mount with him, arm in arm, above.
He paused, and through the immeasurable space his eyes and his heart, penetrating the dismal dungeon, rested on his child.
Beyond those portals I await ye both, beloved pilgrims!&quot;
Yes, thou mayst live thyself to accuse thy beloved Robespierre, and to perish in his fall.&quot;
Permit me the egotism to remind you that you then promised that if ever a day should come when you could serve me, your life--yes, the phrase was, &#39;your heart&#39;s blood&#39;--was at my bidding.
With the inspirer the inspirations had ceased; and, in deserting love, genius also was left behind.
murmured the accusing heart of Viola,--&quot;have I reserved his offspring!
And there, in the very cell beside her own, the atheist Nicot sits stolid amidst the darkness, and hugs the thought of Danton, that death is nothingness.
Thou hast no pity, no love, and no remorse.
But Avarice survives the rest, and the foul heart&#39;s master-serpent swallows up the tribe.
HIS power, HIS arts were gone; but the mystery and the spell known to HER simple heart did not desert her in the hours of trial and despair.
And he heard her voice, though it scarcely left her lips: the low voice that the heart speaks,--loud enough for God to hear!
Canst Thou not make the love that will not die, minister, even beyond the grave, to his earthly fate?
She started to her feet!--he was there,--in all the pride of his unwaning youth and superhuman beauty; there, in the house of dread, and in the hour of travail; there, image and personation of the love that can pierce the Valley of the Shadow, and can glide, the unscathed wanderer from the heaven, through the roaring abyss of hell!
He called her by the familiar epithets of the old endearment, and she only answered him by sobs.
Wildly, passionately, she kissed his hands, the hem of his garment, but voice was gone.
But now, as he closed, and, leaning on his breast, she felt the clasp of his protecting arms,--when, in one holy kiss, the past was forgiven and the present lost,--then there returned to her the sweet and warm hopes of the natural life, of the loving woman.
&quot;Talk not now to me, beloved,--talk not more now to me of the past!
Traverse, if thou wilt, in thy pride of soul, the universe; thy heart again is the universe to mine.
To-morrow, love!
And taking the infant in her arms, and seating herself at a little distance, she rocked it to and fro on her bosom, and prattled to it, and kissed it between every word, and laughed and wept by fits, as ever and anon she cast over her shoulder her playful, mirthful glance upon the father to whom those fading stars smiled sadly their last farewell.
The gladness of divine nature, the roar and dissonance of mortal life, awake again: the trader unbars his windows; the flower-girls troop gayly to their haunts; busy feet are tramping to the daily drudgeries that revolutions which strike down kings and kaisars, leave the same Cain&#39;s heritage to the boor; the wagons groan and reel to the mart; Tyranny, up betimes, holds its pallid levee; Conspiracy, that hath not slept, hears the clock, and whispers to its own heart, &quot;The hour draws near.&quot;
A group gather, eager-eyed, round the purlieus of the Convention Hall; to-day decides the sovereignty of France,--about the courts of the Tribunal their customary hum and stir.
Wearied out with joy, secure in the presence of the eyes regained, she had laughed and wept herself to sleep; and still in that slumber there seemed a happy consciousness that the loved was by,--the lost was found.
Amidst all the exquisite hopes with which love and youth contemplate the future, her eyes had closed.
He bent over and kissed its lips.
&quot;Never more,&quot; he murmured, &quot;O heritor of love and grief,--never more wilt thou see me in thy visions; never more will the light of those eyes be fed by celestial commune; never more can my soul guard from thy pillow the trouble and the disease.
But mild be thy human trials, and strong be thy spirit to love and to believe!
And thus, as I gaze upon thee,--thus may my nature breathe into thine its last and most intense desire; may my love for thy mother pass to thee, and in thy looks may she hear my spirit comfort and console her.
How the sunshine plays upon the waters!--to home, beloved one, to home again!&quot;
He would not kiss, lest he should awaken her, but gently placed round her neck the amulet that would speak to her, hereafter, the farewell,--and promise, in that farewell, reunion!
And while she sat there, mute, rigid, voiceless, as congealed to stone, A VISION, like a wind, glided over the deeps within,--the grim court, the judge, the jury, the accuser; and amidst the victims the one dauntless and radiant form.
They hurry into the court,--the hasty and pale messengers; there is confusion and fear and dismay!
Less fallible than Idealism, but less practically potent, from its ignorance of the human heart.
Resorts, first in its aspiration after the Ideal, to tinsel shows; then relinquishes these for a higher love; but is still, from the conditions of its nature, inadequate to this, and liable to suspicion and mistrust.

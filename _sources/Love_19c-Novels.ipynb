      "But to be murdered thus at the midnight hour by cold-blooded assassins, no friendly hand to close my eyes, or receive my parting blessing—to die in combat, hate and execration—ah, why, my angel love, didst thou restore me to life, when already I had stepped within the portals of the tomb, now that so soon again I was to be flung back a mangled corpse! -0.9782\n",
      "But worse than absence, worse than death, She wept her lover's sullied fame, And, fired with all the pride of birth, She wept a soldier's injured name. -0.978\n",
      "But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars’s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert’s offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny. -0.9568\n",
      "I would have forfeited for him double the value of these lands, which he pursues with an ardour that shows he has forgotten how much I am implicated in the matter.” Lucy, however, could only murmur these things to herself, unwilling to increase the prejudices against her lover entertained by all around her, who exclaimed against the steps pursued on his account as illegal, vexatious, and tyrannical, resembling the worst measures in the worst times of the worst Stuarts, and a degradation of Scotland, the decisions of whose learned judges were thus subjected to the review of a court composed indeed of men of the highest rank, and who were not trained to the study of any municipal law, and might be supposed specially to hold in contempt that of Scotland. -0.9559\n",
      "“True I have married—”’ ‘Oh, ah!’ said Mr. Sempronius, endeavouring to hide his confusion as much and as ineffectually as the audience attempted to conceal their half-suppressed tittering, by coughing with extraordinary violence— —‘“true I have married her;— The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent; no more.” (_Aside_) Why don’t you prompt, father?’ ‘Because I’ve mislaid my spectacles,’ said poor Mr. Gattleton, almost dead with the heat and bustle. -0.9509\n",
      "The family of the Claytons had known better days; but, after a series of reverses, the father died a bankrupt, and the mother heartbroken, and a confirmed invalid, retired with her five children to a little cottage between Eton and Salt Hill. -0.9501\n",
      "Your very look and manner would have frightened the old man to death.” “Consider the provocation,” answered Ravenswood—“consider the ruin and death procured and caused by his hard-hearted cruelty—an ancient house destroyed, an affectionate father murdered! -0.9485\n",
      "But the Archduke, though not deficient in bravery, was so infinitely inferior to Coeur de Lion in that ardour of mind which wooed danger as a bride, that the King very soon held him in a certain degree of contempt. -0.9482\n",
      "With Mary, Miss Austen has taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her; not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting traditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming her privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and singing too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but perhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings in that Fordyce-belectured generation. -0.9419\n",
      "If I had wronged you in thought, or word, or deed, it would have been most cruel to me, and the memory of one you must have loved in some old time; but--' 'Only listen to me for a moment,' interrupted Ralph, seriously alarmed by the violence of her emotions. -0.9398\n"

      "I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear of our parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my duty required, urge him to it for prudence sake, and would have parted for ever on the spot, would he consent to it; but he said it should never be, he did not regard his mother’s anger, while he could have my affections; our prospects are not very bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for the best; he will be ordained shortly; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow, am very sure you will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too, trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John, or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to assist us.—Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did, but she did it for the best, so I say nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won’t think it too much trouble to give us a call, should she come this way any morning, ’twould be a great kindness, and my cousins would be proud to know her.—My paper reminds me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her, and to Sir John, and Lady Middleton, and the dear children, when you chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne, “I am, &c.” As soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to be its writer’s real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise. 0.9978\n",
      "I need not ask you whether you are happy here, my dear Catherine; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe, it would be impossible for you to be otherwise; and the Allens, I am sure, are very kind to you?” “Yes, very kind; I never was so happy before; and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever; how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see _me_.” James accepted this tribute of gratitude, and qualified his conscience for accepting it too, by saying with perfect sincerity, “Indeed, Catherine, I love you dearly.” Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters, the situation of some, the growth of the rest, and other family matters now passed between them, and continued, with only one small digression on James’s part, in praise of Miss Thorpe, till they reached Pulteney Street, where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen, invited by the former to dine with them, and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet. 0.9963\n",
      "But when taking a softer tone, love, affection, happiness inspired the theme, and Luke sought to paint the bliss that should be theirs in his new estate; when he would throw his fortune into her lap, his titles at her feet, and bid her wear them with him; when, with ennobled hand and unchanged heart, he would fulfil the troth plighted in his outcast days; in lieu of tender, grateful acquiescence, the features of Sybil became overcast, the soft smile faded away, and, as spring sunshine is succeeded by the sudden shower, the light that dwelt in her sunny orbs grew dim with tears. 0.9954\n",
      "But that my firm courage and cheerful exertions might shelter the dear mate, whom I chose in the spring of my life; though the throbbings of my heart be replete with pain, though my hopes for the future are chill, still while your dear head, my gentlest love, can repose in peace on that heart, and while you derive from its fostering care, comfort, and hope, my struggles shall not cease,—I will not call myself altogether vanquished. 0.9949\n",
      "If contented with a retired station, I still hope I shall live to see my Evelina the ornament of her neighbourhood, and the pride and delight of her family; and giving and receiving joy from such society as may best deserve her affection, and employing herself in such useful and innocent occupations as may secure and merit the tenderest love of her friends, and the worthiest satisfaction of her own heart. 0.9942\n",
      "Lady Bertram could not give her much time, or many words, but she felt her, as Fanny’s sister, to have a claim at Mansfield, and was ready to kiss and like her; and Susan was more than satisfied, for she came perfectly aware that nothing but ill-humour was to be expected from aunt Norris; and was so provided with happiness, so strong in that best of blessings, an escape from many certain evils, that she could have stood against a great deal more indifference than she met with from the others. 0.9941\n",
      "Emma hung about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.—Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?—He would not deny that he did, she was sure.—Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?—Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his letters, who so glad to assist him?—Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?—Would not he like to have him always on the spot?—Yes. 0.9937\n",
      "Had she been older or vainer, such attacks might have done little; but, where youth and diffidence are united, it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world, and of being so very early engaged as a partner; and the consequence was that, when the two Morlands, after sitting an hour with the Thorpes, set off to walk together to Mr. Allen’s, and James, as the door was closed on them, said, “Well, Catherine, how do you like my friend Thorpe?” instead of answering, as she probably would have done, had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case, “I do not like him at all,” she directly replied, “I like him very much; he seems very agreeable.” “He is as good-natured a fellow as ever lived; a little of a rattle; but that will recommend him to your sex, I believe: and how do you like the rest of the family?” “Very, very much indeed: Isabella particularly.” “I am very glad to hear you say so; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to; she has so much good sense, and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable; I always wanted you to know her; and she seems very fond of you. 0.9935\n",
      "Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal.” “Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.” “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. 0.9934\n",
      "Mrs. Grant, with a temper to love and be loved, must have gone with some regret from the scenes and people she had been used to; but the same happiness of disposition must in any place, and any society, secure her a great deal to enjoy, and she had again a home to offer Mary; and Mary had had enough of her own friends, enough of vanity, ambition, love, and disappointment in the course of the last half-year, to be in need of the true kindness of her sister’s heart, and the rational tranquillity of her ways. 0.9933\n"

      "“Well, if I don’t know who she was in love with, I know who _he_ was.” “She was ten years older,” said her husband.\n",
      "But as my little conductress, with her hair of gold and her frock of blue, danced before me round corners and pattered down passages, I had the view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy sprite, such a place as would somehow, for diversion of the young idea, take all color out of storybooks and fairytales.\n",
      "She expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable duties, looking to me, however, with a great childish light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had conceived for my person, which had rendered necessary that she should follow me.\n",
      "I needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of Mrs. Grose’s comparison, and, catching my pupil in my arms, covered her with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement.\n",
      "What I then and there took him to my heart for was something divine that I have never found to the same degree in any child—his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but love.\n",
      "“Would you mind, miss, if I used the freedom—” “To kiss me?\n",
      "I was lifted aloft on a great wave of infatuation and pity.\n",
      "They had the bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything, to be right, would have to be enclosed and protected, the only form that, in my fancy, the afteryears could take for them was that of a romantic, a really royal extension of the garden and the park.\n",
      "They flanked opposite ends of the house and were probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious, dating, in their gingerbread antiquity, from a romantic revival that was already a respectable past.\n",
      "The attraction of my small charges was a constant joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears, the distaste I had begun by entertaining for the probable gray prose of my office.\n",
      "It was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom.\n",
      "I could take the air in the court, at least, and there Mrs. Grose could join me.\n",
      "I was there to protect and defend the little creatures in the world the most bereaved and the most lovable, the appeal of whose helplessness had suddenly become only too explicit, a deep, constant ache of one’s own committed heart.\n",
      "He has _not_ literally ‘ever,’ in these weeks that I myself have lived with him and so closely watched him; he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful, lovable goodness.\n",
      "They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me; which, after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response in children perpetually bowed over and hugged.\n",
      "They got their little tasks as if they loved them, and indulged, from the mere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed little miracles of memory.\n",
      "We lived in a cloud of music and love and success and private theatricals.\n",
      "“Well,” he said at last, “just exactly in order that you should do this.” “Do what?” “Think me—for a change—_bad!_” I shall never forget the sweetness and gaiety with which he brought out the word, nor how, on top of it, he bent forward and kissed me.\n",
      "I met his kiss and I had to make, while I folded him for a minute in my arms, the most stupendous effort not to cry.\n",
      "Then, after another embrace, the incident and our interview closed on my recognition of all the reserves of goodness that, for his joke, he had been able to draw upon.\n",
      "“But for what?” “For the love of all the evil that, in those dreadful days, the pair put into them.\n",
      "“Don’t they do enough?” I demanded in a lower tone, while the children, having smiled and nodded and kissed hands to us, resumed their exhibition.\n",
      "It was striking of the children, at all events, to kiss me inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and never to fail—one or the other—of the precious question that had helped us through many a peril.\n",
      "Seated at my own table in clear noonday light I saw a person whom, without my previous experience, I should have taken at the first blush for some housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the place and who, availing herself of rare relief from observation and of the schoolroom table and my pens, ink, and paper, had applied herself to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart.\n",
      "“Dear little Miles, dear little Miles—!” My face was close to his, and he let me kiss him, simply taking it with indulgent good humor.\n",
      "It was literally a charming exhibition of tact, of magnanimity, and quite tantamount to his saying outright: “The true knights we love to read about never push an advantage too far.\n",
      "The usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the house, but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever Flora might be, she was not near home.\n",
      "Mrs. Grose was the first to break the spell: she threw herself on her knees and, drawing the child to her breast, clasped in a long embrace the little tender, yielding body.\n",
      "Much as I had made of the fact that this name had never once, between us, been sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the child’s face now received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a pane of glass.\n",
      "_We_ know, don’t we, love?”—and she appealed, blundering in, to the child.\n",
      "I don’t like you!” Then, after this deliverance, which might have been that of a vulgarly pert little girl in the street, she hugged Mrs. Grose more closely and buried in her skirts the dreadful little face.\n",
      "“And did it come?” “No, though I waited and waited, I confess it didn’t, and it was without a breach of the silence or so much as a faint allusion to his sister’s condition and absence that we at last kissed for good night.\n",
      "And if he’s saved—” “Then _you_ are?” The dear woman kissed me on this, and I took her farewell.\n",
      "I kissed his forehead; it was drenched.\n",

      "But there had been extravagance, as will hereafter have to be told, and there had been no continuous residence at Bragton since the death of old Reginald Morton, who had been the best known and the best loved of all the squires in Rufford, and had for many years been master of the Rufford hounds.\n",
      "The eldest, John, married the daughter of a peer, stood for Parliament, had one son, and died before he was forty, owing something over £20,000.\n",
      "In process of time the grandson, who was a second John Morton, grew up and married, and became the father of a third John Morton, the young man who afterwards became owner of the property and Secretary of Legation at Washington.\n",
      "But the great trial of the old man's life, as also the great romance, had arisen from the career of his second son, Reginald.\n",
      "This was in 1829, when all the world was at peace, and his only achievement in Canada was to marry a young woman who is reported to have been pretty and good, but who had no advantages either of fortune or birth.\n",
      "It was at this period of the squire's life that the romance spoken of occurred.\n",
      "He had married a woman who was not a lady!\n",
      "She married, not very early in life, a certain Sir William Ushant, who was employed by his country in India and elsewhere, but who found, soon after his marriage, that the service of his country required that he should generally leave his wife at Bragton.\n",
      "He had no ambition whatever to be master of the U. R. U.; but did look forward to a time when he might be Minister Plenipotentiary at some foreign court.\n",
      "He had married twice, his first wife having, before her marriage, been well known at Bragton Park.\n",
      "No doubt Mr. Masters' practice had been considerably affected by the lowliness of his second marriage.\n",
      "In saying so much of Kate, I do not mean it to be understood that any precocious ideas of love were troubling that young lady's bosom.\n",
      "When he took his seat he did not address himself specially to the lady of his love.\n",
      "From the moment of his birth the Honourable Mrs. Morton, who was also his aunt by marriage, had been his bitter enemy.\n",
      "Up to that time he had no idea of falling in love with the girl himself.\n",
      "Since he had begun to think on such subjects at all he had made up his mind that he would not marry.\n",
      "He had told himself a hundred times that under no circumstances could he marry any other than a lady of good birth.\n",
      "But his own fortune was small, and he knew himself well enough to be sure that he would not marry for money.\n",
      "He was sure that he would not marry.\n",
      "Being a most unreasonable man he conceived a bitter dislike to poor Larry, who, at any rate, was truly in love, and was not looking too high in desiring to marry the portionless daughter of the attorney.\n",
      "The meeting had indeed been planned between her and Dolly and the lover, and this special walk had been taken at the request of the two younger girls.\n",
      "He came up boldly to his love, and shook hands with her with a pleasant smile.\n",
      "She had already perceived that Morton's manner had rendered it impossible that her lover should follow them.\n",
      "It was grievous to him that he should have gone out of his way to ask her to walk with him just at the moment when she was expecting this vulgar lover,--for that she had expected him he felt no doubt.\n",
      "It made him sore at heart to feel that this girl should be sly, and doubly sore to think that she should have been able to love such a one as Lawrence Twentyman.\n",
      "He assured himself that he was not in love with her himself, and that he had no idea of falling in love with her; but it sickened him to think that a girl who had been brought up by his aunt, who had been loved at Bragton, whom he had liked, who looked so like a lady, should put herself on a par with such a wretch as that.\n",
      "When he came to the bridge to meet his sweetheart he had on a dark-green shooting coat, a billicock hat, brown breeches, and gaiters nearly up to his knees.\n",
      "I could fancy that an old lady from London, with an eye in her head for manly symmetry, would have liked to look at Larry, and would have thought that a girl in Mary's position would be happy in having such a lover, providing that his character was good and his means adequate.\n",
      "And then this man had proposed to accompany him, had wanted to join his party, had thought it possible that a flirtation might be carried on in his presence!\n",
      "But what was he to think of such a girl as Mary Masters when she could bring herself to like the attentions of such a lover?\n",

      "But of Reginald Morton's attributes and scholarship and general standing he had a mystified appreciation which saved him from the pain of thinking that such a man could be in love with his sweetheart.\n",
      "It must be remembered that Lawrence Twentyman was twelve years younger than Reginald Morton, and that a man of twenty-eight is apt to regard a man of forty as very much too old for falling in love.\n",
      "He would teach himself to do all he could to promote the marriage.\n",
      "It was pretty well known in Dillsborough that Larry was her lover.\n",
      "She knew quite well that he was warranted in seeking her, and that nothing but a very positive decision on her part could put an end to his courtship.\n",
      "\"You can't think ill of me for loving you better than all the world.\"\n",
      "A young woman doesn't fall in love with every man that she thinks well of.\n",
      "I should like you as well as all the rest of the family if you would only marry some other girl.\"\n",
      "What I want is the girl I love.\n",
      "But Morton had denied him the opportunity, and he had walked on to his own house,--low in spirits indeed, but still with none of that sorest of agony which comes to a lover from the feeling that his love loves some one else.\n",
      "And Mrs. Hopkins was soon led to imagine, though no positive information was given to her on the subject, that Miss Trefoil was engaged to be married to their master.\n",
      "Her own fortune on her marriage had been small, but now she was a rich woman.\n",
      "It was not likely that she should approve absolutely of anything; but to have married without an appeal to her would have been to have sent the money flying into the hands of some of her poor paternal cousins.\n",
      "Mr. Cooper had been enough in the neighbourhood to have known the old squire, and wrote an affectionate note expressing his gratification at the prospect of renewing his acquaintance with the little boy whom he remembered.\n",
      "said Tony Tuppett, who had come up on foot from the barn where the hounds were still imprisoned, and had caught hold in an affectionate manner of a fore pad of the fox which Bean had clutched by the two hind legs.\n",
      "Then the Captain galloped round the side of the covert, and, making use of some strong language, stopped the ardour of certain gentlemen who were in a hurry to get away on what they considered good terms.\n",
      "Then he ascertained that Mr. Puttock had not been presented to, or selected for the living on account of any peculiar fitness;--but that he had been a fellow of Rufford at Oxford till he was forty-five, when he had thought it well to marry and take a living.\n",
      "She certainly had fine eyes, though I could never imagine how any one could look at them and think it possible that she should be in love.\n",
      "Now she was, after a certain fashion, engaged to marry John Morton and perhaps she was one of the most unhappy young persons in England.\n",
      "She had long known that it was her duty to marry, and especially her duty to marry well.\n",
      "\"As for caring about him, mamma,\" she had once said, speaking of a suitor, \"of course I don't.\n"

      "It might possibly suit her still better to become intimate with Lord Rufford.\n",

      "She might declare that she loved some one else and she might marry that other person.\n",

      "Very few of the comforts of a lover had been vouchsafed to John Morton during this sojourn at Bragton and very little had been done in accordance with his wishes.\n",
      "She hoped that her lover would not attempt to ride to hounds on the Tuesday, so that she might be near the lord unseen by him,--and that he would leave Rufford on the Wednesday before herself and her mother.\n",

      "Arabella Trefoil was certainly not a flirt.\n",
      "A girl when she is engaged is not supposed to talk to no one but her recognised lover in a mixed party of ladies and gentlemen, and she is especially absolved from such a duty when they chance to meet in the house of a comparative stranger.\n",
      "It was impossible to say that she had flirted with the man,--and yet Morton felt that he was neglected, and felt also that he was only there because this pleasure-seeking young Lord had liked to have in his house the handsome girl whom he, Morton, intended to marry.\n",
      "He was almost disposed to get up and declare that the girl was engaged to marry him.\n",
      "Young Hampton, who was intimate in the house, made his way up there and Sir John Purefoy joined the party.\n",

      "--would have been the extent of the wailing, and not the pressure of a lover's hand would have been lightened, or the note of a fiddle delayed.\n",
      "But he had loved no one particularly, had been dear to no one in these latter days of his life, had been of very little use in the world, and had done very little more for society than any other horse-trainer!\n",
      "He had been so little intimate with the members of the party assembled and had found himself so much alone, that he had only lately heard the story about Major Caneback, and had now only heard it imperfectly.\n",
      "He was always in love with somebody; but as he had hitherto failed of success where marriage was desirable, so had he avoided disaster when it was not.\n",
      "No doubt he loved her,--after his fashion of loving.\n",
      "But to lose her now would not break his heart, whereas to lose her after he was married to her, would, he knew well, bring him to the very ground.\n",
      "\"I did hear,\" she said, \"from one of your Foreign Office young men that you and Miss Trefoil were very intimate.\"\n",
      "He was certainly very much struck with her, not probably ever waiting to declare to himself that she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life, but still feeling towards her an attraction which for the time was strong.\n",

      "If she would now fix a day for their marriage, he would be a happy man.\n",
      "Then he passed his arm round her waist and lifting her face to his held her in a close embrace from which she made no effort to free herself.\n",
      "\"Well, my love?\"\n",
      "\"When we were alone he sat for five minutes with his arm round my waist, and then he kissed me.\n",
      "But he's an old stager and knows what he's about: and of course there'll be ever so many people to tell him I'm not the sort of girl he ought to marry.\n",
      "The Duke, of course, would like me to marry Lord Rufford.\n",
      "\"If they come to arrangements do you mean to marry him?\"\n",
      "Then without a kiss or wishing her mother good night she went off to her own room.\n",
      "Now Mrs. Masters disliked clergymen, disliked gentlemen, and especially disliked poverty; and therefore was not disposed to look upon Mr. Surtees as an eligible suitor for her stepdaughter.\n",
      "But as the curate's courtship had hitherto been of the coldest kind and as it had received no encouragement from the young lady, Mary was certainly justified in declaring that the allusion was not fair.\n",
      "\"What I want to know is this;--are you prepared to marry Lawrence Twentyman?\"\n",
      "She was not afraid of the fate of an old maid which was threatened, but she did think that her marriage with this man would be for the benefit of the family and a great relief to her father.\n",
      "And she knew too that he was respectable, and believed him to be thoroughly earnest in his love.\n",
      "For such love as that it is impossible that a girl should not be grateful.\n",
      "There was nothing to allure him, nothing to tempt him to such a marriage, but a simple appreciation of her personal merits.\n",
      "\"And so is an honest man's love.\n",
      "\"Now this young man that is wanting to marry you has got all these things, and as far as I can judge with my experience in the world, is as likely to make a good husband as any one I know.\"\n",
      "No young man such as he would be sorry that his sweetheart should be entertained by such a lady as Lady Ushant.\n",
      "She was quite sure that she was not in love with Larry Twentyman; but she was by no means sure that it might not be her duty to accept him without being in love with him.\n",
      "And she was conscious in a certain degree of isolation in the household,--as being her father's only child by the first marriage.\n",
      "But yet there was something awful to her in the idea of giving herself to a man without loving him,--in becoming a man's wife when she would fain remain away from him!\n",
      "And then she blushed as she lay in the dark, with her cheek on her pillow, when she found herself forced to inquire within her own heart whether she did not love some one else.\n",
      "\"I think you must believe that I really do love you with all my heart.\"\n",
      "I'd take you for my wife to-morrow if you hadn't a friend in the world, just for downright love.\n",
      "You wouldn't like a young woman to marry you without loving you.\n",
      "I like you as well, Mr. Twentyman, as one friend can like another,--without loving.\"\n",
      "I'll be that kind to you that I'll make you love me before twelve months are over.\n",
      "Say six weeks, and then, if you'll let me have one kiss, I'll not trouble you till you're back from Cheltenham.\"\n",
      "It was now early in December, and they might be married and settled at home before the end of April.\n",
      "Mrs. Masters, to give him courage, took out a bottle of currant wine and drank his health, and told him that in three months' time she would give him a kiss and call him her son.\n",
      "Mary would of course now accept her lover like any other girl, and had been such a fool,--so thought Mrs. Masters,--that she had thoroughly deserved to lose him.\n",
      "Had she entertained such an idea she might have reconciled herself to it, as the man was able to support a wife, and by such a marriage she would have been at once relieved from all further charge.\n",
      "Thinking of Mary Masters very often as he had done during the last two months, he was quite sure that he did not mean to marry at all.\n",
      "He did acknowledge to himself that were he to allow himself to fall in love with any one it would be with Mary Masters,--but for not doing so there were many reasons.\n",
      "He had lived so long alone that a married life would not suit him; as a married man he would be a poor man; he himself was averse to company, whereas most women prefer society.\n",
      "When they had got back into the railway carriage Morton was very anxious to ask whether she was in truth engaged to marry the young man as to whose good fellowship she and the parrot had spoken up so emphatically, but he hardly knew how to put the question.\n",
      "But a person need not shut himself up and be a hermit because he is not married.\n",
      "Lord Rufford is not married and he goes everywhere.\"\n",
      "And they say he is going to be married to that Miss Trefoil who has been staying there.\n",
      "\"I was afraid that you might have to tell that you were engaged to marry Mr.\n",
      "Knowing how my aunt loves you, knowing what she thinks of you and what she would think of such a match, remembering myself what I do of you, I could not have congratulated you on your engagement to a man whom I think so much inferior to yourself in every respect.\n",
      "\"After what the Rufford people said to me I'm sure he's going to marry her,\" said young Glossop.\n",
      "Young Bartletot took his wife out there,--just married.\n",
      "At the moment when she was hesitating with Larry Twentyman, when she begged him to wait six months and then at last promised to give him an answer at the end of two, she had worked herself up to think that it might possibly be her duty to accept her lover for the sake of her family.\n",
      "But there was nothing of love in all that.\n",
      "\"There is a man at Dillsborough wants to marry her.\"\n",
      "I hope you have not made her give up one suitor by leading her to love another who does not mean to ask her.\"\n",
      "\"Would you have her marry a man who is not a gentleman, whose wife will never be visited by other ladies;--in marrying whom she would go altogether down into another and a lower world?\"\n",
      "With him the same feeling was almost the stronger because he was so well aware of the blot upon himself caused by the lowness of his own father's marriage.\n",
      "I am an old woman who will be dead probably before the first five years of her married life have passed over her.\n",
      "\"I am sure she would feel herself degraded by marrying him.\"\n",
      "Now she had her young friend with her, and that too was an excitement to her,--and the more so since she had heard the tidings of Larry Twentyman's courtship.\n",
      "\"He has got to be intimate and I think mamma likes him.\"\n",
      "Sitting there late into the night Mary told it all as well as she knew how,--all of it except in regard to any spark of love which might have fallen upon her in respect of Reginald Morton.\n",
      "She did not love the man.\n",
      "Though she thought so well of him there was, she was quite sure, no feeling in her heart akin to love.\n",
      "She had promised to take time because she had thought that she might perhaps be able to bring herself to marry him without loving him,--to marry him because her father wished it, and because her going from home would be a relief to her stepmother and sisters, because it would be well for them all that she should be settled out of the way.\n",
      "\"But I never would persuade a girl to marry a man she did not love.\n",
      "It was quite clear to Mary that had she been able to tell Lady Ushant that she was head over ears in love with this young man and that therefore she was going to marry him, her old friend would have found no reason to lament such an arrangement.\n",
      "Mary was almost disappointed; but reconciled herself to it very quickly, telling herself that there was yet time for her to decide in favour of her lover if she could bring herself to do so.\n",
      "Lady Ushant saw nothing but what was right and proper in a marriage with Lawrence Twentyman, but Reginald Morton had declared it to be improper, and therefore it was out of her reach.\n",
      "Then she asked herself the fatal question;--was she in love with Reginald Morton?\n",
      "I do not think that she answered it in the affirmative, but she became more and more sure that she could never marry Larry Twentyman.\n",
      "Her stepmother soon came in and kissed her kindly.\n",
      "Lord Rufford was not a marrying man,--which was supposed to signify that he intended to lead a life of pleasure till the necessity of providing an heir should be forced upon him, when he would take to himself a wife out of his own class in life twenty years younger than himself for whom he would not care a straw.\n",
      "She knew her own powers, and was aware that Lord Rufford was fond of feminine beauty and feminine flutter and feminine flattery, though he was not prepared to marry.\n",
      "It was quite possible that she might be able to dig such a pit for him that it would be easier for him to marry her than to get out in any other way.\n",
      "How far might she dare to be affectionate without putting him on his guard?\n",
      "Should she write in anger or should she write in love,--or should she mingle both?\n",
      "After much thought she determined that mingled anger and love would be the best.\n",
      "Soon after her departure from Rufford she received a very serious but still an affectionate epistle from John Morton in which he asked her if it was her intention to become his wife or not.\n",
      "As she sat thinking of it, giving the very best of her mind to it, she remembered the warmth of that embrace in the little room behind the drawing-room, and those halcyon minutes in which her head had been on his shoulder, and his arm round her waist.\n",
      "Not that they were made halcyon to her by any of the joys of love.\n",
      "But could such a man as Lord Rufford--with his hands so free,--venture to tell himself that such tokens of affection with such a girl would mean nothing?\n",
      "For an hour or two she had almost given up the hope of Rufford and had meditated some letter to her other lover which might at any rate secure him.\n",
      "But he was very melancholy and Mrs. Hopkins declared to old Mrs. Twentyman that the young squire was \"hipped,\"--\"along of his lady love,\" as she thought.\n",
      "\"But we heard, John,\" said Reginald, who did not feel it to be his duty to stand on any ceremony with his younger cousin,--\"we heard that you were going to be married to Miss Trefoil.\n",
      "If you were married you might perhaps take it.\"\n",
      "All Dillsborough had heard that he was to be married to Miss Trefoil, and this cousin of his had been so sure of the fact that he had not hesitated to ask a question about it in the first moment of their first interview.\n",
      "\"You must want things if you are to be married in March or April.\"\n",
      "\"But I shan't be married in March or April.\n",
      "And her stepmother also had declared that she \"must be made to help it,\"--or in other words be made to marry Mr. Twentyman in opposition to her own wishes!\n",
      "When he entered the parlour he had for the moment forgotten Larry Twentyman, and was disposed to greet his girl lovingly;--but he found her dissolved in bitter tears.\n",
      "She could understand that a girl might be asked why she wanted to marry a man, and that in such a condition she ought to be able to give a reason; but it was she thought very hard that she should be asked why she didn't want to marry a man.\n",
      "He yielded to her so far as to part with her at the present moment with soft loving words.\n",
      "According to her theory girls shouldn't be indulged in any vagaries, and this rejecting of a highly valuable suitor was a most inexcusable vagary.\n",
      "It just comes to this;--if you want her to marry Larry Twentyman you had better not notice her for the next fortnight.\n",
      "The attorney did want his daughter to marry the man and was half convinced by his wife.\n",
      "He had told himself that he was not to speak of his love again till the two months were over, and like an honourable man he was prepared to wait the full time.\n",
      "But he determined to be a man as he walked across the street with his old friend, and said not a word about his love.\n",
      "She had been told that she must be made to marry Mr. Twentyman, and the injustice of that threat had at once made her rebel against her stepmother's authority.\n",
      "She would never allow her stepmother to make her marry any one.\n",
      "Then he would partly relent, would kiss her and bid her be a good girl, and would quickly hurry away from her.\n",
      "Dear Mr. Twentyman, I shall always think of you with esteem and regard, because I know how good you are; and I hope you will come to like somebody a great deal better than me who will always love you with her whole heart.\n",
      "\"Because I do not love him as I should have to love any man that I wanted to marry.\n",
      "She had gradually grown bold enough to assure herself that her heart was occupied with that man who had travelled with her to Cheltenham; and she felt that that feeling alone must keep her apart from any other love.\n",
      "And yet, as she had no hope, as she had assured herself that her love was a burden to be borne and could never become a source of enjoyment, why should her secret be wrested from her?\n",
      "Beyond Mr. Surtees or Larry Twentyman he did not know what possible lover Dillsborough could have afforded.\n",
      "Mrs. Twentyman knew very well of his love,--as indeed did nearly all Dillsborough; but she had heard nothing of the two months and did not connect the letter with Mary Masters.\n",
      "He had tried his best because he had really loved the girl.\n",
      "And now when he might fairly consider himself to be free, and when he should surely have congratulated himself on a most lucky escape from the great danger into which he had fallen, his love and admiration for the girl returned to him in a most wonderful manner.\n",
      "If it were the case that the girl feared that her marriage might be prevented by the operations of lawyers and family friends, of course she would be right not to throw herself into his arms,--even metaphorically.\n",
      "He was a cold, just man who, when he had loved, could not easily get rid of his love, and now he would ask himself whether he was not hard upon the girl.\n",
      "Whether he did marry Arabella Trefoil or whether he did not, there was no adequate reason for such a banishment.\n"

      "\"But you are engaged to marry the other man.\"\n",
      "\"Nothing on earth shall make me marry Mr. Morton.\n",
      "My uncle could not but like that his niece should marry Lord Rufford.\"\n",
      "If he does mean to marry the girl he must go to her father;--or it is possible that he might come to me.\n",
      "Her aunt was evidently alive to the advantage of the marriage,--to the advantage which would accrue not to her, Arabella, individually, but to the Trefoils generally.\n",
      "She went round the room and kissed her aunt's brow.\n",
      "He must marry some day and why should not this girl do as well as any one else?\n",
      "She certainly could not allow a lover in her house for her husband's niece without having official authenticated knowledge of the respectability of the lover;--but the whole thing had come upon her so suddenly that she was at a loss what to do or what to say.\n",
      "Then of course he kissed her.\n",
      "\"Then tell me that you love me honestly, sincerely, with all your heart,--and I shall be happy.\"\n",
      "For a few minutes she lay there and as she was lying she calculated whether it would be better to try at this moment to drive him to some clearer declaration, or to make use of what he had already said without giving him an opportunity of protesting that he had not meant to make her an offer of marriage.\n",
      "He had declared that he loved her honestly and with his whole heart.\n",
      "She was conscious but hardly more than conscious that he was kissing her;--and yet her brain was at work.\n",
      "Then she extricated herself from his embrace with a shudder and a laugh.\n",
      "Then, as the carriage was stopping, she took his hand and kissed it.\n",
      "But still she could hardly understand that Lord Rufford should wish to have it known that he travelled about the country in such a fashion with the girl he intended to marry.\n",
      "What;--the man I'm engaged to marry!\n",
      "\"He means to marry me.\n",
      "\"I mean to marry him.\n",
      "Miss Trefoil must have thought that kissing and proposing were the same thing.\n",
      "He liked her well enough, but was certainly not in love with her.\n",
      "I doubt whether men ever are in love with girls who throw themselves into their arms.\n",
      "A man's love, till it has been chastened and fastened by the feeling of duty which marriage brings with it, is instigated mainly by the difficulty of pursuit.\n",
      "If the marriage came off it would be all well.\n",
      "His own girls had been married in so very different a fashion!\n",
      "The Duchess of Omnium did indeed remark to Lady Chiltern that she remembered something of the same kind happening to the same girl soon after her own marriage.\n",
      "As the Duchess had now been married a great many years this was unkind;--but it was known that when the Duchess of Omnium did dislike any one, she never scrupled to show it.\n",
      "Of course he had heard that Morton was to marry Arabella Trefoil, and though he made no direct allusion to the fact, as Reginald had done, he spoke in that bland eulogistic tone which clearly showed his purpose.\n",
      "Then Reginald Morton was sure that the marriage would never take place.\n",
      "But when the cloth was drawn,--for the rector clung so lovingly to old habits that he delighted to see his mahogany beneath the wine glasses,--a more serious subject of dispute arose suddenly, though perhaps hardly more disagreeable.\n",
      "For twenty-four hours Mrs. Masters did not speak to Mary, not at all intending to let her sin pass with such moderate punishment as that, but thinking during that period that as she might perhaps induce Larry to ignore the letter and look upon it as though it were not written, it would be best to say nothing till the time should come in which the lover might again urge his suit.\n",
      "But it was a matter on which a young woman was entitled to judge for herself, and no one had a right to scold her because she could not love him.\n",
      "Mrs. Masters hated such arguments, despised this rodomontade about love, and would have crushed the girl into obedience could it have been possible.\n",
      "Then he had suggested to her the name of the only probable suitor that occurred to him, and she had repelled the idea in a manner that had convinced him at once.\n",
      "Among the young ladies of Dillsborough Reginald Morton was never regarded as even a possible lover.\n",
      "\"I won't have her ill-used because she refuses to marry at your bidding.\"\n",
      "In this letter Mary told as accurately as she could the whole story of Larry's courtship, and was very clear in declaring that under no possible circumstances could she encourage any hope.\n",
      "But of course she said not a word as to any other man or as to any love on her side.\n",
      "Had Reginald been so inclined Lady Ushant would have been very glad to see him marry Mary Masters.\n",
      "But she did not think that Reginald himself was that way minded, and she fancied that poor Mary might be throwing away her prosperity in life were she to wait for Reginald's love.\n",
      "Larry Twentyman was at any rate sure;--and perhaps it might be unwise to separate the girl from her lover.\n",
      "But she told him that Mary had proposed to come to Cheltenham for a long visit because there were disturbances at home,--which disturbances had arisen from her rejection of a certain suitor.\n",
      "The presence of this lover could hardly do her much injury.\n",
      "These were not days in which young women were forced to marry men.\n",
      "He was to remember that as far as she herself was concerned, she dearly loved Mary Masters and would be delighted to have her at Cheltenham; and, so remembering, he was to see the attorney, and Mary herself, and if necessary Mrs. Masters;--and then to report his opinion to Cheltenham.\n",
      "Your affectionate friend, MARGARET USHANT.\n",
      "Arabella Trefoil left her uncle's mansion on the day after her lover's departure, certainly not in triumph, but with somewhat recovered spirits.\n",
      "When she first heard that Lord Rufford was gone,--that he had fled away as it were in the middle of the night without saying a word to her, without a syllable to make good the slight assurances of his love that had been given to her in the post carriage, she felt that she was deserted and betrayed.\n",
      "But if, as the Duchess expected, no such marriage took place, then this ill-conducted niece should never be admitted within the house again.\n",
      "This was not such a letter as she thought that her aunt would approve; but it was, she fancied, such as the Duchess would believe that she would write to her lover.\n",
      "Should this pleasant little message of love miscarry, the serious missile would still be sent, and the miscarriage would occasion no harm.\n",
      "Now there is my serious epistle, and I am sure that you will answer it like a dear, good, kind-hearted, loving--lover.\n",
      "I won't be afraid of writing the word, nor of saying that I love you with all my heart, and that I am always your own ARABELLA.\n",
      "He must know the light in which she was pleased to regard those passages of love which she had permitted so that there might be no mistake.\n",
      "When this attempt was made he decided that he must at once retreat,--or else make up his mind to marry the young lady.\n",
      "He breakfasted that morning at the inn at Stamford, and as he smoked his cigar afterwards, he positively resolved that he would under no circumstances marry Arabella Trefoil.\n",
      "\"She would fall into my arms; she would embrace me; she persisted in asking me whether I loved her!\"\n",
      "And yet is a man to be forced into a marriage which he despises?\n",
      "He would not be forced into the marriage,--and the sooner he retreated the less would be the metaphorical shooting and kicking and the real scorn.\n",
      "\"So you're going to marry Miss Trefoil,\" said Tom Surbiton, who perhaps of all his friends was the most intimate.\n",
      "But as a fact I am not engaged to marry Miss Trefoil, nor is there the slightest chance that I ever shall be so engaged.\"\n",
      "He felt assured that up to that time he had said nothing which could be taken to mean a real declaration of love.\n",
      "In the carriage she had asked him whether he loved her, and he had said that he did.\n",
      "Was a man to be bound to marry a girl because of such a scene as that?\n",
      "But as he thought of it, he swore to himself that nothing should induce him to marry her.\n",
      "The story of his unrequited love was known to every one at Dillsborough and it was now told to Lord Rufford.\n",
      "A young lady wants to marry me.\"\n",
      "\"But I am quite determined, let the result be what it may, that I won't marry the young lady.\"\n",
      "\"A fainting fit in a carriage and half-a-dozen kisses.\"\n",
      "When I acknowledge that I kissed her, of course I encouraged hopes.\"\n",
      "\"But St. Anthony would have had to kiss this young woman if she had made her attack upon him as she did on me;--and after all a kiss doesn't go for everything.\n",
      "But I won't marry her though it were a score of kisses.\n",
      "Of course the man to whom allusion was made was Mr. Twentyman; and of course the discomfort at home had come from Mrs. Masters' approval of that suitor's claim.\n",
      "What was it to him whether Mary Masters married after her kind, or descended into what he felt to be an inferior manner of life?\n",
      "But he had thought at the same time that under no possible circumstances could he have fallen in love with Miss Trefoil.\n",
      "Even now, when he knew that she had applied to his aunt in order that she might escape from her lover, it did not occur to him that she could care for himself.\n",
      "But yet it made him wretched when he reflected that some man would assuredly marry Mary Masters.\n",
      "When the idea occurred to him he found himself reviling Mr. Surtees as being of all men the most puny, the most unmanly, and the least worthy of marrying Mary Masters.\n",
      "She was fixed in opinion that if her husband were joined with her they could still, between them, so break the girl's spirit as to force her into a marriage.\n",
      "Poor Mary as she shrunk into the house was nearly heartbroken.\n"

      "But now, having heard this from the girl's father, he was again vexed, and almost as much disgusted as when he had first become aware that Larry Twentyman was a suitor for her hand.\n",
      "Why should he trouble himself about a girl who was ready to fall in love with the first man that she saw about the place?\n",
      "I can only say that you have altogether mistaken me if you think that I have said anything which was intended as an offer of marriage.\n",
      "But I have had no thoughts of marriage.\n",
      "That a man should fail in his love seems to him to be of all failures the most contemptible, and Larry thought that there would not be one in the field unaware of his miserable rejection.\n",
      "An indiscreet word or two had been said in the hearing of Mrs. Connop Green,--as to which Arabella had already scolded her mother most vehemently, and Mrs. Connop Green too would probably have seen the letter, and would know that it had come from the lover of whom boasts had been made.\n",
      "She had been,--so she had assured herself,--quite sure that that kind, loving response which she had solicited, would not be given to her.\n",
      "How could he have found the courage to say that he had had no thought of marriage when he had declared to her that he loved her?\n",
      "Could it be that such a man as this would be driven into marriage by the interference of Lord Mistletoe!\n",
      "And what was there that she loved?\n",
      "Even when he was kissing her she was thinking of her built-up hair, of her pearl powder, her paint, and of possible accidents and untoward revelations.\n",
      "There was a time on that morning in which she had made up her mind that she would write a most affectionate letter to Morton, telling him that her people had now agreed to his propositions as to settlement, and assuring him that from henceforward she would be all his own.\n",
      "It appears that she has been staying with you at Rufford Hall, and again at Mistletoe, and that while at the latter place you proposed marriage to her.\n",
      "She had gone to stay with Lady Penwether at Lord Rufford's house, and then he had first told her of his love.\n",
      "It is for that reason that a girl generally refers her lover to her father before she allows herself to be considered as engaged.\"\n",
      "I wish with all my heart that it had come off all right; but in these days one can't make a man marry.\n",
      "He sat silent for a minute or two during which she pressed him over and over again to have an interview with her recreant lover, bringing up all the arguments that she knew, reminding him of their former affection for each other, telling him that she had no brother of her own, and that her own father was worse than useless in such a matter.\n",
      "I think it right to tell you this, as my affection for you is what it always has been.\n",
      "This man really loved me.\n",
      "\"In these days one can't make a man marry!\"\n",
      "But John Morton would marry her to-morrow if he were well,--in spite of all her ill usage!\n",
      "As she determined to do so there was something even in her hard callous heart softer than the love of money and more human than the dream of an advantageous settlement in life.\n",
      "It was not only that Britons were slaves,--but that they \"hugged their chains.\"\n",
      "What is to be expected of a country in which such absurdities are loved and sheltered?\n",
      "The two girls had been intensely anxious for the marriage, wishing to have Larry for a brother, looking forward with delight to their share in the unrestricted plenteousness of Chowton Farm, longing to be allowed to consider themselves at home among the ricks and barns and wide fields; but at this moment things had become so tragic that they were cowed and unhappy,--not that Mary should still refuse Larry Twentyman, but that she should be going away for so long a time.\n",
      "A word of encouragement would, she said, bring Larry Twentyman back to his courtship, and that word might be spoken, if Mary's visit to Cheltenham were forbidden.\n",
      "Let Mary once be made to understand that she would not be allowed to be a fine lady, and then she would marry Mr. Twentyman quick enough.\n",
      "Her letter to Mary, though affectionate, was very short.\n",
      "Your affectionate friend, DOLLY.\n",
      "\"As for coward, Mrs. Masters, I don't know--\" \"I suppose you really do love the girl.\"\n",
      "Books and poetry would not teach a girl like Mary to reject her suitor if she really loved him.\n",
      "His love was too genuine, too absorbing, to leave with him the power which Mrs. Masters assumed him to have when she gave him such advice.\n",
      "In the afternoon a walk was suggested, and Mary complied; but when an attempt was made by the younger girls to leave the lover and Mary together, she resented it by clinging closely to Dolly;--and then all Larry's courage deserted him.\n",
      "It was there and there only that she had seen together the two men who between them seemed to cloud all her life,--the man whom she loved and the man who loved her.\n",
      "In that case it might have been that she would have brought herself to give her hand to the suitor of whom all her friends approved.\n",
      "She did love him,--but with a varied love,--a love which was most earnest in wishing his happiness, which would have been desirous of the closest friendship if only nothing more were required.\n",
      "Why had he taught her to think herself unfit to mate with this lover who was her equal?\n",
      "He's getting old and he ought to marry.\n",
      "I don't think girls should ever be in a hurry to marry, and if you can't love him--\" \"Dear Lady Ushant, it is quite settled.\"\n",
      "If he were to live then surely that love which had induced him to make so foolish a petition would suffice to ensure the marriage, if the marriage should then be thought desirable.\n",
      "Of course there would be hymns sung in praise of Arabella's love and constancy, but such hymns would be absolutely ruinous to her.\n",
      "No doubt he had been different from the others, less gay in his attire, less jocund in his words, less given to flattery and sport and gems and all the little wickednesses which she had loved.\n",
      "But John Morton, after once saying that he loved her, had never tired, had never wished to escape.\n",
      "He had been so true to his love, so true to his word, that he had borne from her usage which would have fully justified escape had escape been to his taste.\n",
      "But to the last he had really loved her, and now, on his death bed, he had sent for her to come to him.\n",
      "Then Lady Ushant went on to explain that though she was there now as the female representative of the family she had never been so intimate with John Morton as to admit of such confidence as that suggested.\n",
      "\"I wonder whether he can love me,\" said the girl.\n",
      "I hardly think that he can love me much.\n",
      "\"But you love him?\"\n",

      "Mamma only wants me to marry Lord Rufford, and to throw Mr. Morton over.\n",
      "He sent his love, and would so willingly have seen her instantly,--only that the doctor would not allow it.\n",
      "Lady Ushant might have made some effort to be at least a complaisant hostess to Lady Augustus had she not heard this story,--had she not been told that the woman, knowing her daughter to be engaged to John Morton, had wanted her to marry Lord Rufford.\n",
      "It was but the other day that Arabella had openly declared that in the event of her marriage she would not have her mother as a guest in her own house.\n",
      "\"As if you loved him!\"\n",
      "I don't suppose I do love him.\n",
      "Two or three weeks ago I almost thought I loved Lord Rufford, and now I am quite sure that I hate him.\n",

      "\"But nevertheless I love you.\n",
      "I shall marry some day I suppose, and I know it will be so.\n",
      "Then she stooped down and kissed his hand.\n",
      "She might have married Lord Rufford, or Mr. Morton, or any other man she might have succeeded in catching, and he would not have troubled her either before or after her marriage.\n",
      "In such a position Sir George thought that he was bound to concede as much as this,--in fact to concede almost anything short of marriage.\n",
      "Was it likely that such a man as Lord Augustus should succeed in talking him into marrying any girl?\n",
      "\"Lord Rufford, you've got to marry her.\n",

      "\"I am sure I didn't ask her to marry me.\"\n",

      "He remembered well that he had assured the lady that he loved her, and had a direct question been asked him on that subject he would not have lied.\n",
      "He was quite sure that he had never uttered a hint in regard to marriage, and he came away from the Duke's house almost with an assurance that he had done nothing that was worthy of much blame.\n",

      "The mother had already bethought herself how she must tell this and that lie to the Connop Greens, explaining that Lord Rufford had confessed his iniquity but had disclosed that, for certain mysterious reasons, he could not marry Arabella,--though he loved her better than all the world.\n",
      "As for his marrying you I soon found that that was absolutely out of the question.\"\n",
      "\"Nothing on earth would make him marry you.\n",
      "\"Yes, my love,--old.\n",
      "Or, if you do not marry, it would enable you to live where you pleased independently of me.\n",
      "When they left Marygold in the Connop Green carriage they smiled, and shook hands, and kissed their friends in unison, and then sank back into silence.\n",
      "Of course she was not entitled to his love.\n",
      "She would acknowledge to herself over and over again that he had never spoken a word to her which could justify her in expecting his love.\n",
      "Why had he spoken so strongly to her as to that young man's love?\n",

      "I love him as though he were a brother.\n",
      "\"I love her almost as though she were my own,\" said Lady Ushant.\n",
      "He had for awhile been very intimate at the house, visiting it daily--and during a part of that time the grandmother had been altogether absent.\n",
      "Had he married I should not have expected it because I am the heir.\n",
      "At this moment he almost felt that he disliked the place, though there had been times in which he had thought that he loved it too well.\n",
      "Would it not be his duty to marry,--and, if so, whom?\n",
      "And yet he thought that it would be impossible that he should marry any other person.\n",
      "I have seen a good deal of the lady lately, and under no circumstances would she have married him.\n",
      "\"That's nonsense again,\" continued the new advocate, \"for there is no doubt she might have married Morton all the time had she pleased.\"\n",
      "Mounser is the old woman's nephew, and she is aunt by marriage to the Connop Greens down in Hampshire, and Mrs. Connop Green is first cousin to Lady Augustus.\"\n",
      "\"If Dick's sister married Tom's brother what relation would Dick be to Tom's mother?\n",
      "The other,--in regard to whose end her hard heart was touched, even her conscience seared,--had named her in his will as though his affection was unimpaired.\n",
      "He had become so intimate of late at the Foreign Office, and his visits were so frequent, that he was almost able to dispense with the assistance of any messenger.\n",
      "At this time she had heard nothing of John Morton's will, and had perhaps thought with some tender regret of the munificence of her other lover, which she had scorned.\n",
      "John Morton was dead;--and she had absolutely wept for him in solitude, though she had certainly never loved him.\n",
      "Nor did she love Lord Rufford.\n",
      "She could sympathise with her too, as to the iniquities of her mother, whom none of the Greens loved.\n",
      "She would herself go down to Rufford and force her way into her late lover's presence in spite of all obstacles.\n"

      "He believed he could love as well as Lawrence Twentyman, but he was sure that he could not continue his quest as that young man had done.\n",

      "And he had loved her all that time,--when she was so hard to him!\n",
      "He had loved her, this bright one, even when he thought that she was to be given to that clay-bound rustic lover!\n",

      "Then there did come upon him a feeling of shame as he remembered how often he had spoken of his love to those who were little better than strangers to him, and thought that perhaps such loquacity was opposed to the manliness which she recommended.\n",
      "\"She's going to marry the squire, yonder.\"\n",
      "He hated the idea of secrecy in such an affair, and when Mrs. Masters asked him whether he had any objection to have the marriage talked about, expressed his willingness that she should employ the town crier to make it public if she thought it expedient.\n",
      "Then he kissed the two girls who were to be his sisters, and finished the visit by carrying off the younger to spend a day or two with her sister at Bragton.\n",
      "Mary, as soon as she saw him, blushed up to her eyes, then turning round looked with wistful eyes into the face of the man she was engaged to marry, and with rapid step walked across the bridge up to the side of Larry's horse, and spoke to him with her sweet low voice.\n",
      "Then she retired back to the bridge and again looked to her lover to know whether he would approve.\n",
      "Why had she called him Larry again and again, so tenderly, in that short moment, and looked at him with those loving eyes?\n",
      "Then he declared to himself, without uttering a word, that she did not understand anything about it; she did not comprehend the fashion of his love when she thought, as she did think, that a soft word would be compensation.\n",
      "He has got out of this mess, but every time it becomes worse and worse, and he'll be taken in horribly by some harpy if we don't get him to marry decently.\n",
      "I've no reason to wish to force a wife on him; but of course he'll marry, and unless he's guided, he'll certainly marry badly.\"\n",
      "\"Is Miss Penge in love with him?\"\n",
      "Was it likely that any untitled young lady of eight-and-twenty should be wanting in the capacity of being in love with a young lord, handsome and possessed of forty thousand a year without encumbrances?\n",
      "Lady Penwether, not quite knowing the state of his mind, thought that there might still be some lurking affection for the young lady.\n",
      "I love your sister so well that anything which would break her heart would make me unhappy.\"\n",
      "In all that passed between them the lady affected a status that was altogether removed from that of making or receiving love.\n",
      "But through it all Lord Rufford knew that he would have to marry Miss Penge.\n",
      "He will think that he loves her, and after a lapse of ten or fifteen years will probably really be fond of her.\n",
      "From the moment that she is Lady Rufford, she will love him,--as she loves everything that is her own.\n",
      "If I had named the girl that I would have wished you to love, it would have been Caroline Penge.\"\n",
      "They had chosen their part, and she had chosen hers,--and had thought that she might climb to the glory of wealth and rank, while they would have to marry hard-working clergymen and briefless barristers.\n",
      "But John Morton had believed in her and loved her.\n",
      "Mounser Green, as the nephew of her hostess, had been very kind to her; but hitherto he had never appeared to her in the light of a possible lover.\n",
      "He was a clerk in the Foreign Office, waiting for his aunt's money;--a man whom she had met in society and whom she knew to be well thought of by those above him in wealth and rank; but she had never regarded him as prey,--or as a man whom any girl would want to marry.\n",
      "He was one of those of the other sex who would most probably look out for prey,--who, if he married at all, would marry an heiress.\n",
      "She, in her time, had been on good terms with many such a one,--had counted them among her intimate friends, had made use of them and been useful to them,--but she had never dreamed of marrying any one of them.\n",
      "Up to that moment there had certainly been no thought on her part of transferring what she was wont to call her affections to Mounser Green as a suitor.\n",
      "Trousseaus are now got up by steam, and girls are kept ready to marry at the shortest notice.\n",
      "But it is not to be expected that a girl before her marriage should be exactly true about her old loves.\n",
      "Mounser Green liked Dukes, and loved a Duchess in his heart of hearts.\n",

      "When my aunt hears that you are to be married from the Duke's, she will be quite willing that you should remain with her till you go down to Mistletoe.\"\n",
      "Arabella, who perhaps knew a little more than her lover, could not bring herself to believe that the appeal would be successful, but she made it.\n",
      "If you would be kind enough to let us be married from Mistletoe, you will confer on both of us a very, very great favour.\"\n",
      "She did as she was bid, and the result was that Lord Augustus and his wife, on the occasion of their daughter's marriage, met each other at Mistletoe,--for the first time for the last dozen years.\n",
      "It was late in April when she went down to Mistletoe, the marriage having been fixed for the 3rd of May.\n",
      "The week before her marriage could not be a pleasant week, but then she had been accustomed to endure evil hours.\n",
      "She was quite alone, having felt that she could not bring herself to give the affectionate embrace which the presence of others would require.\n",
      "It had been settled on all sides that the marriage was to be very quiet.\n",
      "The parents of course kissed their child, but there was very little said in the way either of congratulation or farewell.\n",
      "On the Monday morning they were married, and then Arabella was taken off by the happy bridegroom.\n",
      "She knew that she was an old woman, without money, without blood, and without attraction, whom nobody would ever again desire to see.\n"

      "How you would have pitied her--how you would have loved her!\n",
      "As for the question of the marriage, he declared without hesitation that we must for the present dismiss all consideration of it from our minds.\n",
      "He was dangerously in love with a disreputable young woman.\n",
      "May I picture good Papa as an elder in the Temple of Venus, burning incense inexhaustibly on the altar of love?\n",
      "No: Temple of Venus is Pagan; altar of love is not proper--take them out.\n",
      "So handsome, so affectionate, so sweet-tempered; with only one fault--and that a compliment to the women, who naturally adored him in return!\n",
      "For years past (since the death of Mamma), we accustomed ourselves to live in perpetual dread of his marrying some one of the hundreds of unscrupulous hussies who took possession of him: and, worse if possible than that, of his fighting duels about them with men young enough to be his grandsons.\n",
      "I gave her a last kiss--and hurried away.\n",
      "Sooner or later, we susceptible people pay with the heartache for the privilege of loving.\n",
      "No matter: heartache or not, one must have something to love in this world as long as one lives in it.\n",
      "He embraced me with the most touching fervour; he expressed the noblest sentiments--but in the matter of his contemplated marriage, he was immovable.\n",
      "The beloved object, or death--such was the programme of this volcanic old man.\n",
      "To make the prospect more hopeless still, the beloved object proved, on this occasion, to be a bold enough woman to play her trump card at starting.\n",
      "Pray understand that I don't wish to marry him, if his daughters object to it.\n",
      "Our one chance was to spend money in investigating the antecedent indiscretions of the lady's life, and to produce against her proof so indisputable that not even an old man's infatuation could say, This is a lie.\n",
      "\"Your affectionate, \"LUCILLA.\"\n",
      "Not the slightest reflection of Lucilla's recovered cheerfulness appeared in Lucilla's lover.\n",
      "He went on:-- \"Add to that wretched state of things that I am engaged to be married.\n",
      "The woman I love is a woman forbidden to me while I suffer as I suffer now.\n",
      "Deliverance in a few months from the horror of the fits; marriage in a few months to the woman you love.\n",
      "It was now thought likely--if all went well--that the marriage might be celebrated at the end of the three months, from Miss Batchford's residence in town.\n",
      "My sisters assured me that the abominable woman from whom I had rescued him, would most certainly end in marrying him after all, unless I reappeared immediately on the scene.\n",
      "Their marriage would follow, and there would be an end of it!\n",
      "and how fervently he promised never to fall in love again, if I would only take him back to Paris!\n",
      "Heavens, how cruelly that first embrace marked the contrast between what he had been when I left him, and what he had changed to when I saw him now!\n",
      "\"You, who love her, say--can we ever be cruel enough to tell her of _this?_\" I approached to take his hand.\n",
      "Lucilla and I may be married at the end of the time.\"\n",
      "Is it honorable first to entrap her into marrying you--and then to confess to her the color of your face?\"\n",
      "What is she going to marry you for?\n",
      "Trust to her natural good sense--and, better than that, to the devoted love that you have inspired in her.\n",
      "He caught her in his arms, and kissed her, in the first rapture of receiving that welcome news.\n",
      "Never yet had she felt Oscar's heart on Oscar's lips, as she felt it when he kissed her in the first joy of anticipating Nugent's return!\n",
      "\"'Need I tell you, my dearest brother, how deeply you have interested me by the announcement of your contemplated marriage?\n",
      "She stole her hand into his, and whispered, \"You are so fond of Nugent--I begin to be almost afraid there will be no love left for me.\"\n",
      "The admirable absence of any jealousy on his side--his large and generous confidence in _her_ love for _him_--was just the rebuke to her that she could feel; just the rebuke also (in my opinion) that she had deserved.\n",
      "If Oscar did succeed in keeping the truth concealed from her, I was positively resolved, come what might of it, to enlighten her before they were married, with my own lips.\n",
      "Perish the promise which makes me false to a person whom I love!\n",
      "As a clergyman and a lover of poetry (in both capacities) I have long cultivated the art of elocution----\" \"My dear sir, excuse me, you have cultivated it all wrong!\"\n",
      "\"In offering your advice to my wife, Mr. Nugent,\" said the rector, \"you must permit me to remark that it would have had more practical force if it had been the advice of a married man.\n",
      "Nugent put his arm affectionately round his brother's neck, and gave him a hug.\n",
      "\"When you are a married man, Mr. Dubourg,\" said the rector severely, \"you will learn to leave the management of an infant in its mother's hands.\"\n",
      "\"A married man's idea of another man as a husband, always begins and ends with his idea of himself.\"\n",
      "He took Lucilla's hand--kissed it--and whispered something in her ear.\n",
      "The kiss and the whisper acted like a charm.\n",
      "--kissed the hand that she offered to him.\n",
      "\"Why, my love?\"\n",
      "He was not unfavorable to his brother's marriage--on the contrary, he ruffled the rector's dignity (he was always giving offense to Mr. Finch) by suggesting that the marriage might be hastened.\n",
      "I reminded him of his brother's romantic position at Dimchurch and told him to judge for himself of the effect it would produce on the excitable imagination of a young girl.\n",
      "I was obliged to remind him that Lucilla was blind, and that love which, in other cases, first finds its way to the heart through the eyes, could only, in her case, first find its way through the ears.\n",
      "The dreadful epileptic malady would torture the patient and shock the friends about him no more: the marriage might safely be celebrated at the time agreed on.\n",
      "\"The fear of Oscar's confession producing an estrangement between them which might delay the marriage.\n",
      "I am especially anxious that Oscar's marriage should not be put off.\n",
      "When we began our conversation, I own to you I was of Oscar's opinion that he would do wisely to let marriage make him sure of his position in her affections, before he risked the disclosure.\n",
      "In one word, he was man enough to feel that he was the right person to make a clean breast of it--not I. I gave the poor old boy a hug to encourage him, pushed him into the room, shut the door on him, and came out here.\n",
      "There was Oscar the Weak, overwhelmed by the humiliating position in which he had placed himself towards the woman whom he was to marry, towards the brother whom he loved!\n",
      "She stopped once more, and gave me a little propitiatory kiss.\n",
      "For a moment, I was absorbed in my admiration and my love for her.\n",
      "It was not delicate, it was not affectionate--it was not like him--to show such insensibility as that to his brother's shocking disfigurement.\n",
      "I said to Oscar, 'Would it be a relief to your mind to leave her present impression undisturbed until you are married?'\n",
      "I love the poor fellow; and _I_ daren't.\n",
      "Innocent of all suspicion of the truth, there I sat opposite to him, the unconscious witness of that unhappy man's final struggle to be true to the brother whom he loved, and to master the devouring passion that consumed him.\n",
      "He had already tried uselessly to place another obstacle in the way--he had vainly attempted to hasten the marriage which would have made Lucilla sacred to him as his brother's wife.\n",
      "That effort having failed, there was but one honorable alternative left to him--to keep out of her society, until she was married to Oscar.\n",
      "\"Do you expect him to arrive before the marriage?\"\n",
      "I did my best to persuade him--I promised to return for the marriage.\n",
      "After they are married----\" He suddenly stopped; the words seemed to stick in his throat.\n",
      "\"After they are married,\" I repeated.\n",
      "\"When Oscar is married, Oscar will not find my presence indispensable to his happiness.\n",
      "Let Oscar live his quiet married life here.\n",
      "\"I dreamt that I was standing, in my wedding dress, before the altar of a strange church; and that a clergyman whose voice I had never heard before, was marrying me----\" She stopped, impatiently waving her hand before her in the air.\n",
      "I married Nugent Dubourg willingly--married him without a thought of my engagement to Oscar.\n",
      "I want to hear him tell me that he loves me.\n",
      "Lucilla's lover had sunk to something very like a despicable character in my estimation.\n",
      "Suppose _you_ had dreamed that you were marrying Nugent instead of Oscar?\"\n",
      "I should only have dreamed that I was marrying the most agreeable man of the two.\"\n",
      "\"My love!\n",
      "Second thing:--To follow Lucilla, and kiss and make it up.\n",
      "I dare say I am ready to fall in love with the first man who comes my way.\n",
      "I dare say--if I had met your brother before I met you--I should have fallen in love with _him._ Quite likely!\"\n",
      "\"Say you love me.\"\n",
      "\"Say you love me!\"\n",
      "\"Give me a kiss!\"\n",
      "give me a kiss!\"\n",
      "She tightened her hold round his neck, and gave him--ostentatiously gave him--the kiss which he was ashamed to give _her._ I advanced, in contemptuous silence, to the door.\n",
      "\"This is the man whom I should never have loved if I had happened to meet his brother first.\n",
      "She put both arms round his neck; and gave him a shower of kisses all in one.\n",
      "When you marry me, it mustn't be at Dimchurch; it must be in some place they don't know of.\n",
      "She said I should have fallen in love with your brother, if I had met him first.\n",
      "There is a deeper meaning in that, my love, than you can see.\n",
      "With a cry of joy, she drew his face to her, and kissed him on the forehead.\n",
      "\"None, my love.\"\n",

      "In spite of herself, she detects the weak places in the case which Nugent has made out against me--the absence of sufficient motive for the conduct of which he accuses me, and the utter improbability of my plotting and intriguing (without anything to gain by it) to make her marry the man who was not the man of her choice.\n",
      "\"You would know if you really loved me.\"\n",
      "It is a shame to doubt that I love you!\"\n",
      "Ever since I have been here, I have doubted that you love me.\n",
      "He caught me in his arms in a kind of frenzy--holding me to him so violently that he hurt me; kissing me so fiercely that he frightened me.\n",
      "Let me make it less hard for you, my love, to do that, by leaving you to write the word--instead of saying it to me.\n",
      "I love you too dearly to blame you.\n",
      "She accompanies me, at my express request, to the house of a married lady who is a relative of mine, and under whose care she will remain, until the time arrives for our marriage.\n",
      "Both you and he will, I hope, remember that she is of an age to act for herself, and that she is only hastening her marriage with a man to whom she has been long engaged, with the sanction and approval of her family--Believe me, Madam, your faithful Servant, \"OSCAR DUBOURG.\"\n",
      "I will pass over this venerable victim of the amiable delusions of the heart, as rapidly as respect and affection will permit.\n",
      "Once sheltered in the vehicle, I could draw my breath again, and reward him for all the anxiety he had caused me by giving him a kiss.\n",
      "I might have given him a thousand kisses.\n",
      "First conclusion, that time and absence had not produced the slightest change in the love which the poor fellow bore to Lucilla.\n",
      "What does it matter to _me_ whether she is married or not?\n",
      "Had time enough passed, since Lucilla had left Ramsgate, to allow of Nugent's marrying her, under his brother's name?\n",
      "\"A and B, sir, lady and gentleman, both of age, leave one place in England, and go to live in another place, on the fifth of this month--how soon, if you please, can they be lawfully married after that?\"\n",
      "\"They may be married by License,\" said the clergyman--\"provided one of them continues to reside in that other place to which they traveled on the fifth--on the twenty-first, or (possibly) even the twentieth of this month.\"\n",
      "Before the marriage could take place, we should be in England.\n",
      "The last chance, as things were, of preventing Lucilla's marriage to a man who had squandered away every farthing of his money, was the chance of Oscar's arrival in England before the ceremony could take place.\n",
      "We have both looked forward to your arrival with such eager hope--such impatient affection, so to speak.\n",
      "The only words which it is necessary to repeat here, are these:--\"She accompanies me, at my express request, to the house of a married lady who is a relative of mine, and under whose care she will remain, until the time arrives for our marriage.\"\n",
      "Nugent's married relative was Oscar's married relative too.\n",
      "\"With _him?_\" \"With a married lady who is a relative of his.\"\n",
      "My telegram, announcing my return to England with Oscar, had inspired them with their first hope of being able to interfere, and stop the marriage before it was too late.\n",
      "I heard of the ominous absence of the old thrill of pleasure, when Nugent took her hand on meeting her at the seaside--I heard how bitterly his personal appearance had disappointed her (when she had seen his features in detail) by comparison with the charming ideal picture which she had formed of her lover in the days of her blindness: those happier days, as she had called them, when she was Poor Miss Finch.\n",
      "He, who could weep over all his other griefs as easily and as spontaneously as a woman, had not shed a tear since the fatal day when he had discovered that his brother had played him false--that brother who had been the god of his idolatry, the sacred object of his gratitude and his love!\n",
      "I pledge myself to satisfy you, in five minutes, that I have never been unworthy of your affection and your confidence.\n",
      "It is quite likely that notice may have been already given of this fraudulent marriage.\n",
      "\"It's a relief, it's a consolation, to tell _you._ I am fretting about my marriage.\"\n",
      "I lifted my head, and kissed her.\n",
      "At once, my love--before it is too late!\"\n",
      "I heard her say to her husband that she believed I should break my marriage engagement unless I was closely looked after.\n",
      "He has gone to get the Marriage License--he has given notice of the marriage at the church.\n",
      "Find me some way of putting off my marriage.\n",
      "\"Do you really mean, Lucilla, that you no longer love him?\"\n",
      "You know how I used to adore him.\n",
      "You know how enchanted I should once have been to marry him.\n",
      "I saw the tears rising in his eyes; I saw love and pity taking the place of hatred and revenge.\n",
      "\"Try if you can tell, my love, without asking me.\"\n",
      "I wish to see him--and I _do_ see him!--as my fancy drew his picture in the first days of our love.\n",
      "It has given me back my old delightful sensation when I touch him; it keeps my own beloved image of him--the one image I care for--unchanged and unchangeable.\n",
      "\"My life lives in my love.\n",
      "And my love lives in my blindness.\"\n",
      "He had falsely given notice of his marriage at the church, in his brother's name; and he was now in London, falsely obtaining his Marriage License, in his brother's name also.\n",
      "His face expressed the struggle in him of some subtly-mingling influences of love and anguish, of sorrow and shame.\n",
      "You, so handsome and so popular, who may marry any woman you like!\n",
      "\"Say,\" he answered, \"that I gave notice of your marriage at the church here-and that I went to London and got you _this._\" He handed the sheet of paper to his brother.\n",
      "He kissed Oscar's dark cheek, and put the pistol into his own pocket.\n",
      "Return to Browndown when you are married.\n",
      "Two days after they were restored to each other at Sydenham, they were married at the church in that place.\n",

      "To me--when I once or twice attempted to shake her resolution--she replied in another way, merely repeating the words she had said to me at Sydenham: \"My life lives in my love.\n",

      "La Mère Bauche was a native of the village, but her married life had been passed away from it, and she had returned in her early widowhood to become proprietress and manager, or, as one may say, the heart and soul of the Hôtel Bauche at Vernet.\n",
      "One or two had died, others had been married; she had sons settled far away from home, and at the time of which we are now speaking but one was left in any way subject to maternal authority.\n",
      "But since then she had thoroughly done the duty of a mother by the little girl, who had become the pet of the whole establishment, the favourite plaything of Adolphe Bauche,--and at last of course his early sweetheart.\n",
      "But at last it broke upon her senses that her son, Adolphe Bauche, the heir to all her virtues and all her riches, the first young man in that or any neighbouring valley, was absolutely contemplating the idea of marrying that poor little orphan, Marie Clavert!\n",
      "That any one should ever fall in love with Marie Clavert had never occurred to Madame Bauche.\n",
      "She, looking through her green spectacles, had never seen that Marie Clavert was a beautiful creature, full of ripening charms, such as young men love to look on.\n",
      "He had appreciated, as it was natural that he should do, all that had been so utterly indifferent to his mother; and consequently had fallen in love.\n",
      "Consequently also he had told his love; and consequently also Marie had returned his love.\n",
      "Adolphe had been hitherto contradicted but in few things, and thought that all difficulty would be prevented by his informing his mother that he wished to marry Marie Clavert.\n",
      "She had trembled and almost crouched with fear when she confessed her love; and had absolutely hid herself from sight when Adolphe went forth, prepared to ask his mother’s consent to his marriage.\n",
      "In the first place La Mère Bauche had under those green spectacles a heart that in truth was tender and affectionate, and after the first two days of anger she admitted that something must be done for Marie Clavert; and after the fourth day she acknowledged that the world of the hotel, her world, would not go as well without Marie Clavert as it would with her.\n",
      "It was now five years since the world of Vernet discovered that La Mère Bauche was going to marry the capitaine; and for eighteen months the world of Vernet had been full of this matter: but any amount of patience is at last exhausted, and as no further steps in that direction were ever taken beyond the daily cup of coffee, that subject died away--very much unheeded by La Mère Bauche.\n",
      "The truth of this the capitaine had admitted; but Marie, he said, might be married to some one else before two years were over.\n",
      "But to whom should she be married?\n",
      "Why should not he, the capitaine himself, be the man to marry Marie Clavert?\n",
      "She did love Marie well, and could find it in her heart to give her anything--anything except her son, her own Adolphe.\n",
      "The poor girl manifested no disgust to the stiff ungainly lover whom they assigned to her,--who through his whole frame was in appearance almost as wooden as his own leg.\n",
      "“I will be very kind to you,” said the capitaine; “as kind as a man can be.” Marie took his hard withered hand and kissed it; and then looked up into his face with beseeching eyes which were not without avail upon his heart.\n",
      "It could not be permitted that she should marry Adolphe.\n",
      "Nor indeed did his conscience tell him that such a marriage should be permitted.\n",
      "If every pretty girl were allowed to marry the first young man that might fall in love with her, what would the world come to?\n",
      "And then Madame Bauche asked her final question: “You do not think, do you, that you can ever marry Adolphe?” And as she asked it the accustomed terror of her green spectacles magnified itself tenfold.\n",
      "Marie said that she would consent to marry the capitaine when she should hear from Adolphe’s own mouth that he, Adolphe, loved her no longer.\n",
      "It was not her fault, at any rate not now, that she loved her lover.\n",
      "When she heard from his own mouth that he had discarded her, then she would marry the capitaine--or indeed sacrifice herself in any other way that La Mère Bauche might desire.\n",
      "She should have her cup of coffee every evening, and dine at the big table, and wear a silk gown at church, and the servants should all call her Madame; a great career should be open to her, if she would only give up her foolish girlish childish love for Adolphe.\n",
      "Letters were written to Adolphe during all these eventful doings; and a letter came from him saying that he greatly valued Marie’s love, but that as it had been clearly proved to him that their marriage would be neither for her advantage, nor for his, he was willing to give it up.\n",
      "He consented to her marriage with the capitaine, and expressed his gratitude to his mother for the pecuniary advantages which she had held out to him.\n",
      "Marie would understand, as she was well aware, the glance of Adolphe’s eye and the tone of Adolphe’s voice; she would perceive at once from them what her lover really meant, what he wished, what in the innermost corner of his heart he really desired that she should do.\n",
      "Money and pleasure, and some little position in the world, would soon wean him from his love; and then Marie would accept her destiny--as other girls in the same position had done since the French world began.\n",
      "But she would not on any score be induced to consent that Adolphe should marry Marie Clavert.\n",
      "When the capitaine was once married she would make him know his place, in spite of all her promises to Marie.\n",
      "On the evening before the day Madame Bauche had met her in the passages, and kissed her as she wished her good night.\n",
      "Marie knew little about sacrifices, but she felt that it was a sacrificial kiss.\n",
      "He shook hands very cordially with the capitaine--of whose intended alliance with his own sweetheart he had been informed, and then as he entered the house with his hand under his mother’s arm, he asked one question about her.\n",
      "Everybody had heard something of the story, and they were all on the alert to see the young man whose love or want of love was considered to be of so much importance.\n",
      "And not without some inward joy; for Madame Bauche thought she saw that her son was cured of his love.\n",
      "When Madame Bauche sought her out in her own little room, and with a smiling face and kind kiss bade her go to the grotto, she knew, or fancied that she knew that it was all over.\n",
      "And try and behave well, like a sensible girl.” “Yes, maman,”--and so she went, bearing on her brow another sacrificial kiss--and bearing in her heart such an unutterable load of woe!\n",
      "And she, when she would hear him, would run; and then he would catch her breathless at the top, and steal kisses from her when all power of refusing them had been robbed from her by her efforts at escape.\n",
      "There was no such running now, no such following, no thought of such kisses.\n",
      "She had retired some way from the wall, so that no eyes might possibly see her but those of her false lover.\n",
      "He did not even kiss her cheek as a brother would have done!\n",
      "He had been a brother to her before he had become her lover.\n",
      "It seems quite clear that we can never get ourselves married.\n",
      "Could no eloquence, no love prevail?\n",
      "“Never get ourselves married!” she said, repeating his words.\n",
      "Can we never be married?” “Upon my word, my dear girl, I fear not.\n",
      "You see I can do nothing without money from her--and as for you, you see she won’t even let you stay in the house unless you marry old Campan at once.\n",
      "And if you do marry him, why you see you’ll stay here, and have it all your own way in everything.\n",
      "As for me, I shall come and see you all from time to time, and shall be able to push my way as I ought to do.” “Then, Adolphe, you wish me to marry the capitaine?” “Upon my honour I think it is the best thing you can do; I do indeed.” “Oh, Adolphe!” “What can I do for you, you know?\n",
      "“You would have my love,” said she; “my deepest, warmest, best heart’s love.\n",
      "What does love mean, if it does not mean that?\n",
      "Oh, Adolphe, you do love me, you do love me, you do love me?” “Yes;--I love you,” he said slowly;--as though he would not have said it, if he could have helped it.\n",
      "“And do not I love you?” said the passionate girl.\n",
      "Adolphe, I so love you, that I cannot give you up.\n",
      "How can I marry that man!\n",
      "Oh Adolphe, how can you wish that I should marry him?” And she clung to him, and looked at him, and besought him with her eyes.\n",
      "“Did you not kiss that when you swore before the figure of the Virgin that I should be your wife?\n",
      "He did love her;--love her as such men do love sweet, pretty girls.\n",
      "The warmth of her hand, the affection of her touch, the pure bright passion of her tear-laden eye had re-awakened what power of love there was within him.\n",
      "But I don’t see how the very devil we can manage it.” “Will you let me tell her that I will not marry the capitaine; that I will not give up your promises; and then I am ready to leave the house?” “It would do no good.” “It would do every good, Adolphe, if I had your promised word once more; if I could hear from your own voice one more tone of love.\n",
      "It was here that you forced me to say that I loved you.\n",
      "He had quite enough of love for her to make him wish to marry her; quite enough now, at this moment, to make the idea of her marriage with the capitaine very distasteful to him; enough probably to make him become a decently good husband to her, should fate enable him to marry her; but not enough to enable him to support all the punishment which would be the sure effects of his mother’s displeasure.\n",
      "Besides, he had promised his mother that he would give up Marie;--had entirely given in his adhesion to that plan of the marriage with the capitaine.\n",
      "You can understand how she and the capitaine are worrying me.” “But tell me, Adolphe, do you love me?” “You know I love you, only--” “And you will not give me up?” “I will ask my mother.\n",
      "I will try and make her yield.” Marie could not feel that she received much confidence from her lover’s promise; but still, even that, weak and unsteady as it was, even that was better than absolute fixed rejection.\n",
      "Then she looked at him as though she expected some sign of renewed love.\n",
      "Do you dare to say that you hold my son bound to marry you?” And then the august mother paused for an answer.\n",
      "She looked suppliantly towards her lover, as though beseeching him to carry on the fight for her.\n",
      "Know this then, Adolphe shall never marry a child of charity such as you are.” Marie sat still, stunned by the harshness of these words.\n",
      "And when this story of Marie’s love first reached her ears, she had been very angry; but her anger had never brought her to such a pass as this.\n",
      "Capitaine Campan is willing to marry you; and as his wife I will keep my word to you, though you little deserve it.\n",
      "If you refuse to marry him, you must go.\n",
      "It would never do for us to marry; it would not indeed.” “Then it is decided,” said Marie, returning to her chair.\n",
      "“And you will marry the capitaine?” said La Mère Bauche.\n",
      "Come here, Marie, and kiss me.\n",
      "When once you are Madame Campan, you shall be my own child; and you shall have any room in the house you like to choose--there!” And she once more imprinted a kiss on Marie’s cold forehead.\n",
      "But in five minutes from the time of this last kiss they were divided.\n",
      "Was it not right, she asked the Virgin, that she should save her son from a bad marriage?\n",
      "She had on her countenance neither the soft look of entreating love which she had worn up there in the grotto, nor did she appear crushed and subdued as she had done before his mother.\n",
      "There might still be love there, but it was love proudly resolving to quell itself.\n",
      "I have not come to ask you again to love me.\n",
      "I know this now, that I was wrong ever to have loved you.\n",
      "Angrily as she had expressed herself at the idea of Marie’s daring to love her son, she had still acknowledged within her own heart that such love had been natural.\n",
      "He did not expect that he should really be preferred, con amore, to a young fellow like Adolphe.\n",
      "And then the marriage was fixed for a very early day; for as La Mère said, “What was the use of waiting?\n",
      "All their minds were made up now, and therefore the sooner the two were married the better.\n",
      "But then she acquiesced, quietly enough if not readily, in what other people did and said; and so the marriage was fixed for the day week after Adolphe’s return.\n",
      "They were married in the great salon, the dining-room, immediately after breakfast.\n",
      "She simpered and smiled, and looked gay even in spite of her spectacles; and as the ceremony was being performed, she held fast clutched in her hand the gold watch and chain which were intended for Marie as soon as ever the marriage should be completed.\n",
      "“And I,--I will be so kind to her!” And so the marriage was completed, and the watch was at once given to Marie.\n",
      "She had always been romantic, he said, and had now gone out to walk by the river-side.\n",
      "“They’ll hear you if you call.” He could not endure that the world should learn that a marriage with him had been so distasteful to Marie Clavert.\n",
      "In her innermost heart now did La Mère Bauche wish that this cruel marriage had been left undone.\n",
      "Fanny the elder wore long glossy curls,--for I write, oh reader, of bygone days, as long ago as that, when ladies wore curls if it pleased them so to do, and gentlemen danced in pumps, with black handkerchiefs round their necks,--yes, long black, or nearly black silken curls; and then she had such eyes;--I never knew whether they were most wicked or most bright; and her face was all dimples, and each dimple was laden with laughter and laden with love.\n",
      "We had scowled at each other in the morning as very young men do when they are strangers; and now, after a few hours, we were intimate friends.\n",
      "But Lord love you--” and he again looked at the enormous extent which lay between the heel and the toe of the shooting apparatus which he still held in his hand.\n",
      "“Not at all unnatural I think,” said I, looking tenderly and lovingly into her face.\n",
      "They certainly love flirting as they also love dancing.\n",
      "But they flirt without mischief and without malice.\n",
      "“I don’t think he has got any others,” said Tizzy--“at least none others left.” On the whole I am glad I did not marry into the family, as I could not have endured that girl to stay in my house as a sister-in-law.\n",
      "It was delightful to feel how intimate I was with them, and how anxious they were to make me happy.\n",
      "I am an Englishman, living, as all Englishman should do, in England, and my wife would not, I think, be well pleased were any one to insinuate that she were other than an Englishwoman; but in the circumstances of my marriage I became connected with the south of Spain, and the narrative which I am to tell requires that I should refer to some of those details.\n",
      "My father, James Pomfret, lived there for ten years before his marriage; and since that and up to the present period, old Mr. Daguilar has always been on the spot.\n",
      "He was, I believe, born in Spain, but he came very early to England; he married an English wife, and his sons had been educated exclusively in England.\n",
      "I felt, at the first, that there was something lacking to make my cup of love perfectly delightful.\n",
      "It was very sweet, but there was wanting that flower of romance which is generally added to the heavenly draught by a slight admixture of opposition.\n",
      "I feared that the path of my true love would run too smooth.\n",
      "When Maria came to our house, my mother and elder sister seemed to be quite willing that I should be continually alone with her; and she had not been there ten days before my father, by chance, remarked that there was nothing old Mr. Daguilar valued so highly as a thorough feeling of intimate alliance between the two families which had been so long connected in trade.\n",
      "Besides, as I afterwards learned, Mr. Daguilar had already proposed the marriage to his partner exactly as he would have proposed a division of assets.\n",
      "But I could not resist attending on her in the hall as she started; and, when she took leave of us, she put her face up to be kissed by me, as she did by my father, and seemed to receive as much emotion from one embrace as from the other.\n",
      "I had received lessons in England from Maria Daguilar; but six weeks is little enough for making love, let alone the learning of a foreign language.\n",
      "Nothing could be nicer than the way in which I was welcomed at Mr. Daguilar’s house, or more kind--I may almost say affectionate--than Maria’s manner to me.\n",
      "But it was too affectionate; and I am not sure that I should not have liked my reception better had she been more diffident in her tone, and less inclined to greet me with open warmth.\n",
      "As it was, she again gave me her cheek to kiss, in her father’s presence, and called me dear John, and asked me specially after some rabbits which I had kept at home merely for a younger sister; and then it seemed as though she were in no way embarrassed by the peculiar circumstances of our position.\n",
      "It could not be that she meant to refuse me, or she would not smile on me and be so loving; but I could almost have found it in my heart to wish that she would.\n",
      "A love that is to be had like a bale of goods is not exactly the love to suit my taste.” But then, when I met her again in the morning, I could no more have quarrelled with her than I could have flown.\n",
      "It opened from the corner of a narrow, unfrequented street--a corner like an elbow--and, as seen from the exterior, there was nothing prepossessing to recommend it; but the outer door led by a short hall or passage to an inner door or grille, made of open ornamental iron-work, and through that we entered a court, or patio, as they called it.\n",
      "Nothing could be more lovely or deliciously cool than was this small court.\n",
      "In the middle of the court there was a fountain, and round about on the marble floor there were chairs, and here and there a small table, as though the space were really a portion of the house.\n",
      "An English husband might do very well, the interests of the firm might make such an arrangement desirable, such a mariage de convenance--so I argued to myself--might be quite compatible with--with heaven only knows what delights of super-terrestial romance, from which I, as being an English thick-headed lump of useful coarse mortality, was to be altogether debarred.\n",
      "But I wish that some learned pundit would give us a good definition of romance, would describe in words that feeling with which our hearts are so pestered when we are young, which makes us sigh for we know not what, and forbids us to be contented with what God sends us.\n",
      "A man looks at her he would love as at a distant landscape in a mountainous land.\n",
      "Beneath those deep black eyes there lay a well of love, good, honest, homely love, love of father and husband and children that were to come--of that love which loves to see the loved ones prospering in honesty.\n",
      "Poetry and romance!\n",
      "In the first week of my sojourn in Seville I spoke no word of overt love to Maria, thinking, as I confess, to induce her thereby to alter her mode of conduct to myself.\n",
      "“She knows that I have come here to make love to her--to repeat my offer; and she will at any rate be chagrined if I am slow to do so.” But it had no effect.\n",
      "And do you not like music either?” “Oh, yes, I adore it,” I replied.\n",
      "“No, John,” she said, with the sweetest, prettiest smile, “we don’t do that here; only when people are married.” And she made this allusion to married life out, openly, with no slightest tremor on her tongue.\n",
      "And I would ask her, also, who was this young man with whom she was intimate--for whom all her volubility and energy of tone seemed to be employed?\n",
      "She had told me once that it behoved her to consult a friend in Seville as to the expediency of her marriage with me.\n",
      "Why did she always speak to me in a tone of childish affection, as though I were a schoolboy home for the holidays?\n",
      "no; for I love them.\n",
      "As to speaking of love, and signifying my pleasure that Don Tomàs should for the future be kept at a distance, any such effort was quite beyond me.\n",
      "Well, my dream of Spanish love must be over.\n",
      "“Do you love me?” “Love you!” “Yes, do you love me?\n",

      "He was in love, and was not altogether satisfied with the conduct of his lady-love.\n",
      "Soon after his arrival at Spanish Town he had been taken by Miss Jack to Shandy Hall, for so the residence of the Leslies was called, and having remained there for three days, had fallen in love with Marian Leslie.\n",
      "Now in the West Indies all young ladies flirt; it is the first habit of their nature--and few young ladies in the West Indies were more given to flirting, or understood the science better than Marian Leslie.\n",
      "Maurice Cumming fell violently in love, and during his first visit at Shandy Hall found that Marian was perfection--for during this first visit her propensities were exerted altogether in his own favour.\n",
      "He came back full of admiration, not altogether to Miss Jack’s dissatisfaction; for Miss Jack was willing enough that both her nephew and her niece should settle down into married life.\n",
      "Now to a man in love, who has had but little experience of either balls or young ladies, this is intolerable.\n",
      "As a rule they will not know how thoroughly flirting is an institution in the West Indies--practised by all young ladies, and laid aside by them when they marry, exactly as their young-lady names and young-lady habits of various kinds are laid aside.\n",
      "And I must add also in her favour that she did not keep her flirting for sly corners, nor did her admirers keep their distance till mamma was out of the way.\n",
      "Had she been called on to make one at a synod of the clergy of the island, she would have flirted with the bishop before all his priests.\n",
      "“If you like Marian, why don’t you marry her?” Miss Jack had once said to him; and this coming from Miss Jack, who was made of money, was a great deal.\n",
      "“But if you like to try, I’ll help you.” With reference to this, Maurice as he left Miss Jack’s residence on his return to Mount Pleasant, had declared that Marian Leslie was not worth an honest man’s love.\n",
      "When you marry a wife I suppose you mean to be master?” “At any rate I shan’t marry her,” said Maurice.\n",
      "But there was a dogged constancy of feeling about Maurice which could not allow him to disburden himself of his love.\n",
      "But not the less was he in love with her;--not the less, though he would swear to himself three times in the day that for no earthly consideration would he marry Marian Leslie.\n",
      "She was often morose, crabbed, and self-opinionated; but then she knew her own imperfections, and forgave those she loved for evincing their dislike of them.\n",
      "But she loved her nephew with all her heart; and though she dearly liked to tyrannise over him, never allowed herself to be really angry with him, though he so frequently refused to bow to her dictation.\n",
      "And she loved Marian Leslie also, though Marian was so sweet and lovely and she herself so harsh and ill-favoured.\n",
      "She loved Marian, though Marian would often be impertinent.\n",
      "She forgave the flirting, the light-heartedness, the love of amusement.\n",
      "He dearly, ardently loved that little flirt; but seeing that she was a flirt, that she had flirted so grossly when he was by, he would not confess his love to a human being.\n",
      "That he did love her he could not help, but he would not disgrace himself by acknowledging it.\n",
      "“Take my word for it he loves her.” “Fudge,” said Mr. Leslie.\n",
      "Miss Jack had spoken to her sister, Mrs. Leslie, as well as to Mr. Leslie, about this marriage scheme.\n",
      "If they really love each other they’ll come together; and if they don’t, why then they’d better not.” “And you really mean that you’re going back to Spanish Town to-day?” said Mrs. Leslie to her visitor.\n",
      "But Mr. Pomken had no idea that that young Cumming was in love.\n",
      "But yet from his comfortless corner he could see Marian as she sat in her pride of power, with her friend Julia Davis near her, a flirt as bad as herself, and her satellites around her, obedient to her nod, and happy in her smiles.\n",
      "I do not know whether there be as a rule more vocal expression of the sentiment of love between a man and woman than there is between two thrushes!\n",
      "Indeed you know you had promised.” He did not answer her, but he looked at her--full in the face, with his sad eyes laden with love.\n",
      "Before the tropical darkness had fallen upon them Maurice had told the tale of his love,--and had told it in a manner differing much from that of Marian’s usual admirers.\n",
      "But if not----” and then he explained to her, with all a lover’s warmth, and with almost more than a lover’s liberty, what was his idea of her being “his own, his very own,” and in doing so inveighed against her usual light-heartedness in terms which at any rate were strong enough.\n",
      "Perhaps she knew that the lesson was somewhat deserved; and perhaps she appreciated at its value the love of such a man as Maurice Cumming, weighing in her judgment the difference between him and the Ewings and the Grahams.\n",
      "Her father and mother had said something to her of this proposed marriage; something, but very little; and she had answered by saying that she did not think Maurice had any warmer regard for her than of a cousin.\n",
      "As to her own feelings she could then say nothing, for she then knew nothing;--nothing but this, that she loved no one better than him, or rather that she loved no one else.\n",
      "She would ask herself if she could love him; but he must give her some little time for that.\n",
      "And then the amusement of the evening commenced, and Marian stood up for a quadrille with her lover.\n",
      "When she had done she would sit down, and then she consented to stand up for two quadrilles with two very tame gentlemen, to whom no lover could object.\n",
      "“If Sir Rue won’t let you waltz now, what will he require of you when you’re married to him?” “I am just as well able to waltz with whom I like as you are, Julia; and if you say so in that way, I shall think it’s envy.” “Ha--ha--ha; I may have envied you some of your beaux before now; I dare say I have.\n",
      "Then about four o’clock she went home, and as she attempted to undress herself in her own room she burst into violent tears and opened her heart to her sister--“Oh, Fanny, I do love him, I do love him so dearly!\n",
      "“One who loves you as well as you love her--and she cannot love you better.\n",
      "Come in, Marian.” The poor girl crept in at the door, ashamed of what she was induced to do, but yet looking anxiously into her lover’s face.\n",
      "From that night to the morning of her marriage--and the interval was only three months--Marian Leslie was never known to flirt.\n",
      "Early in life he had married a timid, anxious, pretty, good little wife, whose whole heart and mind had been given up to do his bidding and deserve his love.\n",
      "She feared love also, though she longed for that as well as feared it;--for her girls, I mean; all such feelings for herself were long laid under ground;--and then, like a timid creature as she was, she had other indefinite fears, and among them, a great fear that those girls of hers would be left husbandless,--a phase of life which after her twelve years of bliss she regarded as anything but desirable.\n",
      "Susan was not so good a girl in the kitchen or about the house as was her sister; but she was bright in the parlour, and if that motherly heart could have been made to give out its inmost secret--which, however, it could not have been made to give out in any way painful to dear Hetta--perhaps it might have been found that Susan was loved with the closest love.\n",
      "He had no idea of making love to Susan Bell; of course not.\n",
      "’Twas thus he began his courtship.\n",
      "Susan had not the slightest idea of regarding Aaron as even a possible lover.\n",
      "She knew that her sister was sitting alone in the cold, and Hetta was affectionate.\n",
      "Had not she smiled, and looked gratified, and kissed her sister, and declared that Phineas Beckard was a nice dear man, and by far the most elegant preacher at the Springs?\n",
      "I--I love you dearly, with all my heart.\n",
      "He did not ask for any love in return.\n",
      "She had never had a lover before; nor had she ever thought of Aaron absolutely as a lover, though something very like love for him had been crossing over her spirit.\n",
      "Of course she loved him.\n",
      "Hetta, she knew, would be dead against such a lover, and of her mother’s approbation she had hardly more hope.\n",
      "Why they should disapprove of Aaron as a lover she had never asked herself.\n",
      "Maybe that Susan regarded a lover as one of them.\n",
      "To say that she loved him was of course impossible, and to say that she did not was equally so.\n",
      "But he did kiss it.\n",
      "But she could not think; she could only love.\n",
      "“What do you want me to say, Mr. Dunn?” “Say, God bless you, Aaron.” “God bless you, Aaron,” said she; and yet she was sure that she had not declared her love.\n",
      "“I hope you’ll love your brother-in-law,” said she to Susan.\n",
      "There were four or five days left for courtship before Hetta and Mr. Beckard would return; four or five days during which Susan might be happy, Aaron triumphant, and Mrs. Bell nervous.\n",
      "The widow still felt an undefined fear that she was wrong, and though her heart yearned to know that her daughter was happy in the sweet happiness of accepted love, yet she dreaded to be too confident.\n",
      "And then Susan hardly knew how to behave herself with her accepted suitor.\n",
      "But he, unconscionable lover, wanted to hear her speak, was desirous of being talked to, and perhaps thought that he should by rights be allowed to sit by her, and hold her hand.\n",
      "But though there was much love between Aaron and Susan, there was as yet but little intimacy.\n",
      "Once for a moment he did find his love alone, immediately as he came into the house.\n",
      "“My own Susan, you do love me?\n",
      "“Yes,” she whispered; but she slipped like an eel from his hands, and left him only preparing himself for a kiss.\n",
      "And then when she got to her room, half frightened, she clasped her hands together, and bethought herself that she did really love him with a strength and depth of love which filled her whole existence.\n",
      "“Proposed to her!” said Hetta, who perhaps thought that one marriage in a family was enough at a time.\n",
      "“Yes, my love--and he did it, I must say, in a very honourable way, telling her not to make any answer till she had spoken to me;--now that was very nice; was it not, Phineas?” Mrs. Bell had become very anxious that Aaron should not be voted a wolf.\n",
      "And the conference ended in a resolution that Phineas Beckard should have a conversation with Aaron Dunn, as to his worldly means and position; and that he, Phineas, should decide whether Aaron might, or might not be at once accepted as a lover, according to the tenor of that conversation.\n",
      "“It will only flurry her the more.” How would she have liked it, if without consulting her, they had left it to Aaron to decide whether or no she might marry Phineas?\n",
      "“Then you can hardly marry quite at present,” said the discreet minister.\n",
      "When Mr. Beckard in the widow’s presence--Hetta had retired in obedience to her lover--informed him of the court’s decision, there came over his face the look which he had worn when he burned the picture.\n",
      "She had had a lover for a week, and now she was to be robbed of him.\n",
      "Had they all been compliant and gracious to him he would have been as bashful as his love; but now his temper was hot.\n",
      "There had been something very consolatory, very sweet, to the poor girl in her lover’s last words.\n",
      "But of this she felt sure, when she came to question her heart, that she could never, never, never cease to love him better than all the world beside.\n",
      "During the whole long summer they heard not a word of him nor from him; and then when the cold winter months came and their boarders had left them, Mrs. Beckard congratulated her sister in that she had given no further encouragement to a lover who cared so little for her.\n",
      "“Oh, yes, no doubt,” said the gentleman, “for I happen to know that they count greatly on him.” And yet he sent no word of love.\n",
      "She thought that it was wicked in Susan to grow thin and pale for love of Aaron Dunn, and she hardly hid her thoughts.\n",
      "But her mother’s pity and soft love did ease her sufferings, though it could not make them cease.\n",
      "“Was I wicked to love him at the first,” she asked that night.\n",
      "Why, oh why, had she driven away from her door-sill the love of an honest man?\n",
      "It was very short, and did not contain one word of love; but it made the widow’s heart leap for joy.\n",
      "“I don’t mean this very moment, love.\n",
      "“Yes, love.\n",
      "So Susan lay in bed, thinking of her happiness, dozing now and again, and fearing as she waked that it was a dream, looking constantly at that drawing of his, which she kept outside upon the bed, nursing her love and thinking of it, and endeavouring, vainly endeavouring, to arrange what she would say to him.\n",
      "“If he loves you he will hardly see what you have on,” said the mother.\n",
      "She had her lover there quite safe, safe beyond anything that Mr. or Mrs. Beckard might have to say to the contrary.\n",
      "Hetta and Phineas came down, and discussed the whole subject of the coming marriage with Mrs. Bell.\n",
      "Such was the courtship of Susan Dunn.\n",
      "That Belgium is now one of the European kingdoms, living by its own laws, resting on its own bottom, with a king and court, palaces and parliament of its own, is known to all the world.\n",
      "Loved by his friends he loved all the world.\n",
      "Were it not for a certain rigidity, sternness, and mental inflexibility,--we will call it military ardour,--with which they were imbued, they would have created envy in the bosom of a fox-hunter.\n",
      "She was tall and thin, with fierce-looking eyes, rendered more fierce by the spectacles which she wore; with a red nose as I said before; and about her an undescribable something which quite convinced me that she had never known--could never know--aught of the comforts of married life.\n",
      "1, a young lady about nineteen, actuated by a general affection for all sword-bearing, fire-eating heroes.\n",
      "Then, wrapped in his cloak, Mr. Horne followed me along the quays and through the narrowest of the streets; and at length, without venturing to return the gaze of any one in the hotel court, he made his way up to his own bedroom.\n",
      "In person Miss Dawkins was not without attraction.\n",
      "Miss Dawkins--Sabrina Dawkins was her name, but she seldom had friends about her intimate enough to use the word Sabrina--was certainly a clever young woman.\n",
      "To a married man there are always two sides, and in this instance there was Mrs. Damer as well as Mr. Damer.\n",
      "She did not conceive any violent affection for Miss Dawkins, but she told her daughter that “the single lady by herself was a very nice young woman, and that it was a thousand pities she should have to go about so much alone like.” Miss Damer had turned up her pretty nose, thinking, perhaps, how small was the chance that it ever should be her own lot to be an unprotected female.\n"

      "She did not know much of him, she said to herself at first; but she knew as much, she said afterwards, as she had known personally of Mr. Thompson before their marriage.\n",
      "It was quite evident that he was fond of her children, and that he would be a kind and affectionate father to them.\n",
      "Should she many again,--and she put it to herself quite hypothetically,--she would look for no romance in such a second marriage.\n",
      "The elder sister, who had talked over the matter with her school companions, expected a fine castle with turrets, battlements, and romance; and the other expected a pretty smiling house, such as princes, in her mind, ought to inhabit.\n",
      "Madame, with all my heart and soul I love you.\n",
      "Mrs. Thompson, could she have had her own way, would not have allowed her lover of fifty to go down upon his knees, and would have spared him much of the romance of his declaration.\n",
      "“But my one great consideration is this;--that I love madame to distraction.” “I am very much flattered; of course, any lady would so feel.\n",
      "But, if you would deign to make me happy, say that one word, ‘I love you!’” M. Lacordaire, as he uttered these words, did not look, as the saying is, at his best.\n",
      "I have enough for myself and my children; and, should I every marry again, I should not, I hope, be felt as a burden by my husband; but it would, of course, be my duty to know what were his circumstances before I accepted him.\n",
      "To give him his due he was not desirous of marrying her solely for her money’s sake.\n",
      "He also wished for a comfortable home, and proposed to give as much as he got; only he had been anxious to wrap up the solid cake of this business in a casing of sugar of romance.\n",
      "If one were to inquire on the spot one might probably find that the ladies all believe it, and the old men; that all the young men know exactly how much of it is false and how much true; and that the steady, middle-aged, well-to-do islanders are quite convinced that it is romance from beginning to end.\n",

      "In her earlier years, when young girls usually first bud forth into womanly beauty, the neighbours had not thought much of Anastasia Bergen, nor had the young men of St. George been wont to stay their boats under the window of Crump Cottage in order that they might listen to her voice or feel the light of her eye; but slowly, as years went by, Anastasia Bergen became a woman that a man might well love; and a man learned to love her who was well worthy of a woman’s heart.\n",
      "This was Caleb Morton, the Presbyterian, minister of St. George; and Caleb Morton had been engaged to marry Miss Bergen for the last two years past, at the period of Aaron Trow’s escape from prison.\n",
      "In the first place, his daughter was very necessary to him, and the idea of her marrying and going away had hardly as yet occurred to him; and then he was by no means inclined to part with any of his money.\n",
      "Now, the income which Caleb Morton earned as a Presbyterian clergyman was not large, and, therefore, no day had been fixed as yet for his marriage with Anastasia.\n",
      "He had not forbidden Mr. Morton his house, or affected to be in any degree angry because his daughter had a lover.\n",
      "He had merely grumbled forth an intimation that those who marry in haste repent at leisure,--that love kept nobody warm if the pot did not boil; and that, as for him, it was as much as he could do to keep his own pot boiling at Crump Cottage.\n",
      "“So you are going,” she said to her lover, one evening, as he rose from the chair on which he had been swinging himself at the door of the cottage which looks down over the creek of the sea.\n",
      "She had been working sedulously with her needle during all that last conversation; but when her lover was gone, she allowed the work to fall from her hands, and sat motionless for awhile, gazing at the last streak of colour left by the setting sun; but there was no longer a sign of its glory to be traced in the heavens around her.\n",
      "Why should not she and Morton still live at the cottage when they were married?\n",
      "He had been separated from the wife he had loved, and the children who had been raised at his knee,--separated by his own violence; and now, as he had said of himself, he was a wolf rather than a man.\n",
      "As soon as she was in the arms of her lover, all her power had gone from her.\n",
      "It was all joy with her now, as she sat motionless without speaking, while he administered to her wants and spoke words of love into her ears.\n",
      "And _he_ was there caressing her, loving her, comforting her!\n",
      "The wretch who had thus treated the woman whom he loved should be hunted down like a wild beast, as long as he had arms and legs with which to carry on the hunt.\n",
      "It was a singularly romantic spot, but now well known to them all there, for they had visited it over and over again that morning.\n",
      "And then his fancy told to each what might be the nature of an embrace with such an animal as that, driven to despair, hopeless of life, armed, as they knew, at any rate, with a knife!\n",
      "“Stay where you are, Mr. Morton,--stay awhile for the love of God--or he’ll have you down.” “Now’s your time, Caleb; in on him now, and you’ll have him.” “Close with him, Morton, close with him at once; it’s your only chance.” “There’s four of us here; we’ll fire on him if he as much as shows a limb.” All of which words as they were heard by that poor wretch within, must have sounded to him as the barking of a pack of hounds thirsting for his blood.\n",
      "If the Fates would but grant him to fix his clutches in the throat of the man who had ill-used his love; for the rest it might all go as it would.\n",
      "If indeed they could be separated,--if Morton could once make himself free from that embrace into which he had been so anxious to leap,--then indeed there might be a hope.\n",
      "She had torn herself asunder, as she told me, from the younger nurslings of her heart, and had left them to the care of a devoted female attendant, whose love was all but maternal.\n",
      "And then she said a word or two about the General, in terms which made me almost think that this quasi-maternal love extended itself beyond the children.\n",
      "Her marriage vow was to her paramount to all other vows and bonds whatever.\n",
      "Invincibly attached herself to the marriage tie, she would constantly speak of it as by no means necessarily binding on others; and, virtuous herself as any griffin of propriety, she constantly patronised, at any rate, the theory of infidelity in her neighbours.\n",
      "He was certainly much given to what the world at Rome called flirting, but this did not in the least annoy her.\n",
      "She was twenty years his junior, and yet she never flirted with any one.\n",
      "Many of us, indeed, were in the habit of seeing each other daily, and of visiting together the haunts in Rome which are best loved by art-loving strangers; but here, in this drawing-room, we were sure to come together, and here before the end of November, Mrs. Talboys might always be found, not in any accustomed seat, but moving about the room as the different male mental attractions of our society might chance to move themselves.\n",
      "She became, however, very dear to us all before she left us, and certainly we owed to her our love, for she added infinitely to the joys of our winter.\n",
      "Mackinnon himself can revel among the clouds in his own writings, and can leave us sometimes in doubt whether he ever means to come back to earth; but when his foot is on terra firma, he loves to feel the earthly substratum which supports his weight.\n",

      "But much as Patience had ever loved Miss Le Smyrger, she was not content with this, and therefore she had been called on to put forth a strong hand of her own.\n",
      "She had not society; she had not a fortune; she had not any assurance of future means of livelihood; she had not high hope of procuring for herself a position in life by marriage; she had not that excitement and pleasure in life which she read of in such books as found their way down to Oxney Colne Parsonage.\n",
      "Any intimate friend of Miss Le Smyrger’s might be as fortunate, for she was equally well provided at Oxney Combe, by which name her house was known.\n",
      "She had married a man even then well to do in the world, but now rich and almost mighty; a Member of Parliament, a lord of this and that board, a man who had a house in Eaton Square, and a park in the north of England; and in this way her course of life had been very much divided from that of our Miss Le Smyrger.\n",
      "Why I shall bring him over here to talk to your father.” “He’ll be too fashionable for that; and papa won’t trouble his head about him if he finds that he doesn’t care for Dartmoor.” “Then he may fall in love with you, my dear.” “Well, yes; there’s that resource at any rate, and for your sake I dare say I should be more civil to him than papa.\n",
      "But he’ll soon get tired of making love, and what you’ll do then I cannot imagine.” That Miss Woolsworthy felt no interest in the coming of the Captain I will not pretend to say.\n",
      "She had heard, when there was no thought of any such visit to Oxney Colne, that John Broughton was a handsome, clever man--one who thought much of himself, and was thought much of by others--that there had been some talk of his marrying a great heiress, which marriage, however, had not taken place through unwillingness on his part, and that he was on the whole a man of more mark in the world than the ordinary captain of ordinary regiments.\n",
      "In many respects--nay, I may say, as to all ordinary matters, no two women could well be more intimate with each other than they were,--and more than that, they had the courage each to talk to the other with absolute truth as to things concerning themselves--a courage in which dear friends often fail.\n",
      "No confession was necessary to inform her that Patience Woolsworthy was in love with John Broughton--ay, in love, to the full and entire loss of her whole heart.\n",
      "I miss you when you come in so late that there’s no time to say a word before we go to bed.” She got up and followed him into the parsonage, and when they were in the sitting-room together, and the door was closed, she came up to him and kissed him.\n",
      "“Do you mean for always?” “If I were to marry, papa?” “Oh, marry!\n",
      "It would make me very happy, Patty, to see you married to a man you would love--very, very happy; though my days would be desolate without you.” “That is it, papa.\n",
      "But who is it, love?\n",
      "But on such a morning she would not sit at her bedroom window--she would do nothing which would force her to accuse herself of a restless longing for her lover’s coming.\n",
      "It was not that she wished her nephew to marry Patience--or rather that she had entertained any such wish when he first came among them.\n",
      "“I am so glad to see you, so delighted to see you, if--if--if--,” and then she paused, for with all her courage she hardly dared to ask her nephew whether he had come there with the express purpose of asking Miss Woolsworthy to marry him.\n",
      "When a man in such a place as that has talked to a girl of love day after day, must not he talk of it to some definite purpose on the day on which he leaves her?\n",
      "He had done so honestly and truly, but in words, or, perhaps, simply with a tone, that had hardly sufficed to satisfy the proud spirit of the girl he loved.\n",
      "She by that time had confessed to herself that she loved him with all her heart; but she had made no such confession to him.\n",
      "To him she had spoken no word, granted no favour, that any lover might rightfully regard as a token of love returned.\n",
      "Then he had spoken out and had asked for that hand,--not, perhaps, as a suitor tremulous with hope,--but as a rich man who knows that he can command that which he desires to purchase.\n",
      "“If the journey was too much for your poor London strength, could you not have waited till to-morrow morning, when you would have found me at the parsonage?” But she did not draw her hand away from him, or in any way pretend that he had not a right to accost her as a lover.\n",
      "I am more eager to see those I love than you seem to be.” “How do you know whom I love, or how eager I might be to see them?\n",
      "There is an old woman there whom I love, and I have thought nothing of this walk with the object of seeing her.” And now, slowly drawing her hand away from him, she pointed to the farmhouse which she had left.\n",
      "“Patty,” he said, after a minute’s pause, during which she had looked full into his face with all the force of her bright eyes; “I have come from London to-day, straight down here to Oxney, and from my aunt’s house close upon your footsteps after you, to ask you that one question--Do you love me?” “What a Hercules!” she said, again laughing.\n",
      "Do you love me?” “And what if I do?\n",
      "What then, Captain Broughton?” “It cannot be that you love me, or you would not joke now.” “Perhaps not, indeed,” she said.\n",
      "She knew that she loved him with all her heart; that it would nearly kill her to part with him; that she had heard his renewed offer with an ecstacy of joy.\n",
      "She acknowledged to herself that he was giving proof of his devotion as strong as any which a girl could receive from her lover.\n",
      "That word once said, and then she knew that she must succumb to her love for ever!\n",
      "Do you love me?” She now stood still, and almost trembled as she looked up into his face.\n",
      "With downright honesty she told him everything: how she had loved him before her heart was warranted in such a passion; how, with much thinking, she had resolved that it would be unwise to take him at his first word, and had thought it better that he should return to London, and then think over it; how she had almost repented of her courage when she had feared, during those long summer days, that he would forget her; and how her heart had leapt for joy when her old friend had told her that he was coming.\n",
      "I almost wish now that I had not seen you till to-morrow.” But as she spoke she pressed his arm, and this caress gave the lie to her last words.\n",
      "How strong love had grown up, springing from neighbourly kindness, between our Patience and his mother, it needs not here to tell; but rising from it had come another love--or an ambition which might have grown to love.\n",
      "If there could be any hope for him, he would present himself as a suitor--on trial.\n",
      "“I have been, asked in marriage, and I have given myself away.” “Well, my love, if you will be happy----” “I hope I shall; I think I shall.\n",
      "But you, papa?” “You will not be far from us.” “Oh, yes; in London.” “In London?” “Captain Broughton lives in London generally.” “And has Captain Broughton asked you to marry him?” “Yes, papa--who else?\n",
      "Will you not love him?\n",
      "Oh, papa, do not say that I am wrong to love him?” He never told her his mistake, or explained to her that he had not thought it possible that the high-placed son of the London great man should have fallen in love with his undowered daughter; but he embraced her, and told her, with all his enthusiasm, that he rejoiced in her joy, and would be happy in her happiness.\n",
      "That concomitant in this affair of his marriage, he had now missed.\n",
      "That it would be well for him to become a married man, looking merely to the state of life as opposed to his present state, he had fully resolved.\n",
      "That Patty Woolsworthy was good, affectionate, clever, and beautiful, he was sufficiently satisfied.\n",
      "What would his sister say, she who had married the Honourable Augustus Gumbleton, gold-stick-in-waiting to Her Majesty’s Privy Council?\n",
      "It had been very sweet, that warm, that full, that ready declaration of love.\n",
      "Yes; it had been very sweet; but--but--; when, after her little jokes, she did confess her love, had she not been a little too free for feminine excellence?\n",
      "A man likes to be told that he is loved, but he hardly wishes that the girl he is to marry should fling herself at his head!\n",
      "When Patience Woolsworthy had answered him coldly, bidding him go back to London and think over his love; while it seemed from her manner that at any rate as yet she did not care for him; while he was absent from her, and, therefore, longing for her, the possession of her charms, her talent and bright honesty of purpose had seemed to him a thing most desirable.\n",
      "He loved her dearly.\n",
      "“All went merry as a marriage bell,” at any rate as far as Patience was concerned.\n",
      "Her first day of acknowledged love was a day altogether happy, and when she prayed for him as she knelt beside her bed there was no feeling in her mind that any fear need disturb her joy.\n",
      "There was something in her lover’s manner--something which at first she could not define--which by degrees seemed to grate against her feelings.\n",
      "He was sufficiently affectionate, that being a matter on which she did not require much demonstration; but joined to his affection there seemed to be----; she hardly liked to suggest to herself a harsh word, but could it be possible that he was beginning to think that she was not good enough for him?\n",
      "“Patty,” her father said to her before they went to bed, “he seems to me to be a most excellent young man.” “Dear papa,” she answered, kissing him.\n",
      "“And terribly deep in love,” said Mr. Woolsworthy.\n",
      "She would ask him whether he thought himself liable to injury from this proposed marriage; and though he should deny any such thought, she would know from the manner of his denial what his true feelings were.\n",
      "She had said, before those few ill-omened words had passed her lover’s lips, that she would probably be at Miss Le Smyrger’s house on the following morning.\n",
      "Those ill-omened words did pass her lover’s lips, and then she remained at home.\n",
      "To be the wife of the man I loved; to have the privilege of holding his happiness in my hand; to know that I was his own--the companion whom he had chosen out of all the world--that would, indeed, be a leap upwards; a leap almost to heaven, it all that were so.\n",
      "She lifted it to her lips and kissed it, and then, leaving him, passed from the summer-house down through the wicket-gate, and straight home to the parsonage.\n",
      "Not a word was spoken against the suitor who had on that day returned to London with a full conviction that now at least he was relieved from his engagement.\n",
      "He also had loved her, but he was not capable of a love which could much injure his daily peace.\n",
      "The romance of her life was played out in that summer.\n",
      "She never sits now lonely on the hill-side thinking how much she might do for one whom she really loved.\n",
      "But with a large heart she loves many, and, with no romance, she works hard to lighten the burdens of those she loves.\n",
      "As for Captain Broughton, all the world know that he did marry that great heiress with whom his name was once before connected, and that he is now a useful member of Parliament, working on committees three or four days a week with a zeal that is indefatigable.\n",
      "They would not otherwise have shown such interest every time I blew my nose or relieved my huskiness by a slight cough;--they would not have been so intimate with that surgeon from St. Bartholomew’s who dined with them twice at the Albion; nor would they have gone to work directly that my back was turned, and have done those very things which they could not have done had I remained at home.\n",
      "He had been in business and connected with a fairly good house in Sise Lane, but he had married early, and things had not exactly gone well with him.\n",
      "Fear goes further with them than love, and between man and man they understand nothing of forbearance.\n",
      "“Nobody will want to kiss you, my lady Fineairs,” said Harry, who was just a year younger.\n",
      "Elizabeth Garrow had already been in love with Godfrey Holmes, or perhaps it might be more becoming to say that Godfrey Holmes had already been in love with her.\n",
      "He was a man well to do in the world, who had money also of his own, and who might well afford to marry.\n",
      "Some two years since, on the eve of leaving Thwaite Hall, he had with low doubting whisper told Elizabeth that he loved her, and she had flown trembling to her mother.\n",
      "Dearest, dearest mamma, I do love him.\n",
      "But in teaching herself this she also taught herself to think that there was a certain merit in refusing herself the natural delight of a lover, even though the possession of the lover were compatible with all her duties to herself, her father and mother, and the world at large.\n",
      "It was not that she had determined to have no lover.\n",
      "She made no such resolve, and when the proper lover came he was admitted to her heart.\n",
      "She had resolved that in loving her lord she would not worship him, and that in giving her heart she would only so give it as it should be given to a human creature like herself.\n",
      "She and Elizabeth had once seen each other, and for the last year or two had corresponded, but personally they had never been intimate.\n",
      "Good night, dearest; pray don’t overdo yourself with work, and do take care of your eyes.” So saying she kissed him and went her way.\n",
      "You are not the girl to have accepted Godfrey without loving him, nor is he the man to have asked you without loving you.\n",
      "I think I will.” “Do you love him?” For a moment or two Bessy remained silent, striving to arrange her words so that they should contain no falsehood, and yet betray no truth.\n",
      "But here again poor Bessy was made to understand how terribly difficult was this experiment of entertaining on a footing of friendship a lover with whom she had quarrelled only a month or two before.\n",
      "You will make them think that those foolish boys are in love with them.” “The foolish boys, as you call them, will look after that themselves.\n",
      "My idea is, that if you like a young man, and he asks you to marry him, you ought to have him.\n",
      "“But with them I shall only be a temporary nuisance; if I remain behind I shall become a permanent evil.” And thus Bessy and her old lover were left by themselves.\n",
      "I have never been very bright there, Bessy, since you left us.” There was nothing in his calling her Bessy, for it had become a habit with him since they were children; and they had formerly agreed that everything between them should be as it had been before that foolish whisper of love had been spoken and received.\n",
      "But I have never thought that we had been unwise in that.” “And yet I think you loved me.” “I am bound to confess I did so, as otherwise I must confess myself a liar.\n",
      "I told you at the time that I loved you, and I told you so truly.\n",
      "But it is better, ten times better, that those who love should part, even though they still should love, than that two should be joined together who are incapable of making each other happy.\n",
      "If you have ceased to love me, there is an end of it.\n",
      "But if you love me still, let all that be forgotten.” “Forgotten, Godfrey!\n",
      "I had no right to love you, knowing you as I did; and knowing also that my ways would not be your ways.\n",
      "In marriage should not the man and woman adapt themselves to each other?” “When they are married, yes.\n",
      "And every girl who thinks of marrying should know that in very much she must adapt herself to her husband.\n",
      "And if you tell me that now, at such a moment as this, what would you tell me in the close intimacy of married life, when the trifles of every day would have worn away the courtesies of guest and lover?” There was a sharpness of rebuke in this which Godfrey Holmes could not at the moment overcome.\n",
      "Had he been poor, had she not loved him, had not all good things seemed to have attended the promise of such a marriage, she would have been less suspicious of herself in receiving the offer, and more gracious in replying to it.\n",
      "She spoke with scorn of a woman clinging to a tree like ivy; and yet, were she once married, no woman would cling to her husband with sweeter feminine tenacity than Bessy Garrow.\n",
      "“I do believe that she loves me, and if she does, perhaps she may still listen to you.” Major Garrow did not feel sure that he “knew it all.” But when he had fully discussed the matter that night with his wife, then he thought that perhaps he had arrived at that knowledge.\n",
      "If you do not love him;--if you feel that as his wife you should not love him, there is not another word to be said.\n",
      "I need not explain to my daughter that under such circumstances she would be wrong to encourage the visits of a suitor.\n",
      "But your mother says you do love him.” “Oh, mamma!” “I will not ask you.\n",
      "When once a girl has confessed to a man that she loves him, the confession and the love together put upon her the burden of a duty towards him, which she cannot with impunity throw aside.” Then he kissed her, and bidding her give him a reply on the morning of the new year, left her with her mother.\n",
      "It is generally supposed that people who live at home,--good domestic people, who love tea and their arm-chairs, and who keep the parlour hearth-rug ever warm,--it is generally supposed that these are the people who value home the most, and best appreciate all the comforts of that cherished institution.\n",
      "She will love her husband.\n",
      "And now, she thought, how there would be another meeting on those quays at which there should be no broken hearts; at which there should be love without sorrow, and kisses, sweet with the sweetness of welcome, not bitter with the bitterness of parting.\n",
      "“Harry, if you love me, let me go by the Serapiqui.” As to Harry’s loving her, there was no doubt about that, as she well knew.\n",
      "Arkwright himself was a man not given to much talking, a silent thoughtful man, stern withal in his outward bearing, but tender-hearted and loving in his nature.\n",
      "“Poor mamma,” she said, “I shall never see her!” And then again, “Harry, I know I shall never reach home alive.” “Fanny, my darling, that is nonsense.” But in order that his spoken word might not sound stern to her, he took her in his arms and kissed her.\n",
      "Those from whom they now parted had not seemed to be dear to them in any especial degree while they all lived together in the same small town, seeing each other day by day; but now,--now that they might never meet again, a certain love sprang up for the old familiar faces, and women kissed each other who hitherto had hardly cared to enter each other’s houses.\n"

      "They sat through the night in the small hut, and in the morning they came forth with their clothes still wet and dirty, with their haggard faces, and weary stiff limbs, encumbered with the horrid task of burying that loved body among the forest trees.\n",
      "“A tariff!” said I to the consul, feeling that the whole romance of my expedition would be dissipated by such an arrangement.\n",
      "To my way of thinking, there is nothing on earth so pleasant as a pleasant wife; but then, what is there so damnable as one that is unpleasant?” “Are you a married man?” he inquired.\n",
      "Now the fact is, that I am a married man with a family; but I am not much given to talk to strangers about my domestic concerns, and, therefore, though I had no particular object in view, I denied my obligations in this respect.\n",
      "“No,” said he; “I am not married; I am all alone in the world.” “Then I certainly would not allow myself to be troubled by unpleasant acquaintances.” It was now four hours since we had left Jerusalem, and we had arrived at the place at which it was proposed that we should breakfast.\n",
      "I would have done almost anything in reason for his comfort; and yet he was a melancholy fellow, with good inward pluck as I believed, but without that outward show of dash and hardihood which I confess I love to see.\n",
      "So I sat and smoked, and talked to him about our past journey, and by degrees the power of speech came back to him, and I again felt that I loved him!\n",
      "Yes, loved him!\n",
      "I have not taken many such fancies into my head, at so short a notice; but I did love him, as though he were a younger brother.\n",
      "She had asked me, too, whether I was a married man, and I had denied it.\n",
      "I am a married man.\n",
      "She did not remember at the moment that when I answered her chance question as to my domestic affairs, I had answered it as to a man who was a stranger to me, and not as to a beautiful woman, with whom I was about to pass certain days in close and intimate society.\n",
      "The junior brother was a married man, with a wife some twenty years younger than himself, with two daughters, the elder of whom was now one-and-twenty, and one son.\n",
      "To both of them, love,--the idea of love,--must be the thought of all the most absorbing; for is it not fated for them that the joys and sorrows of their future life must depend upon it?\n",
      "But the idea of the German girl is the more realistic, and the less romantic.\n",
      "Poetry and fiction she may have read, though of the latter sparingly; but they will not have imbued her with that hope for some transcendental paradise of affection which so often fills and exalts the hearts of our daughters here at home.\n",
      "In associating with young men, an English girl will always remember that in each one she so meets she may find an admirer whom she may possibly love, or an admirer whom she may probably be called on to repel.\n",
      "She is ever conscious of the fact of this position; and a romance is thus engendered which, if it may at times be dangerous, is at any rate always charming.\n",
      "As you and I, my reader, might probably become dear friends were we to meet and know each other, so may the German girl learn to love the fair-haired youth with whom chance has for a time associated her; but to her mind there occurs no suggestive reason why it should be so,--no probability that the youth may regard her in such light, because that chance has come to pass.\n",
      "When love and marriage should come to her, as come they probably might, she would endeavour to attune herself to a new happiness and a new sphere of duties.\n",
      "But change would certainly come, we may prophesy; for Isa Heine was a beautiful girl, tall and graceful, comely to the eye, and fit in every way to be loved and cherished as the partner of a man’s home.\n",
      "He always fancied that he was in love with Isa, and wrote some poetry about her.\n",
      "He was alone with Isa frequently, for neither father, mother, nor Isa herself objected to such communion; but yet things so went between them that he could not take her by the hand and tell her that he loved her.\n",
      "Their wants were all satisfied, and for them, that, together with their close family affection, was happiness enough.\n",
      "“Isa, are you in love with Herbert?” Agnes asked her, as they were together in their room one night.\n",
      "“In love with him?\n",
      "No; why should I be in love with him?” “I think he is in love with you,” said Agnes.\n",
      "Not but what we are great friends, and I love him dearly.\n",
      "Because I love you, Isa, and would have you for my wife,--if that be possible.” She still continued her work, and the stitches, if not quite as perfect as usual, sufficed for their purpose.\n",
      "And now will you learn from me again?” “That is,--you mean to ask, will I marry you?” “Will you love me?\n",
      "Can you learn to love me?\n",
      "Isa, can you love me?” And he sat himself close beside her.\n",
      "Now that the ice was broken, he was quite prepared to become an ardent lover,--if she would allow of such ardour.\n",
      "At last, after a three days’ debate, the matter ended thus,--with by no means a sufficiency of romance for his taste.\n",
      "He had looked forward to the ecstasies of a lover’s life, but very few of those ecstasies were awarded to him.\n",
      "Very few, indeed, of a lover’s privileges did he enjoy.\n",
      "As to the young people’s marriage, that was his brother’s affair, not his.\n",
      "Who ever heard of a partnership being given away merely because a man wanted to marry?\n",
      "Nothing could be nicer than such a marriage!\n",
      "“Oh, Isa, is that your love?” “No, Herbert, that is not my love; that is my discretion;” and she even laughed with her mild low laughter, as she answered him.\n",
      "“You know you are too impatient to wait four years, and what else therefore can I say?” “I wonder whether you love me?” said Herbert, with a grand look of injured sentiment.\n",
      "I do not love you so that I need make every one around us unhappy because circumstances forbid me to marry you.\n",
      "That sort of love would be baneful.” “Ah no, you do not know what love means!” “Not your boisterous, heartbreaking English love, Herbert.\n",
      "Though you fancy that you love me, in your heart you hardly approve of me.” “Fancy that I love you!\n",
      "I love you well enough to wait these four years with the hope of becoming your wife when they are over.\n",
      "But you will think but little of my love when I tell you that this waiting would not make me unhappy.\n",
      "If you wish it, I will hold myself as engaged to you,--to be married to you when those four years are past.\n",
      "He had some little present income from home, some fifty pounds a year or so, and he would be satisfied to marry on that and on his salary as a clerk; but to this papa and mamma Heine would not consent;--neither would Isa.\n",
      "You could not live comfortably in two small rooms, and with bad dinners.” “I do not care a straw about my dinners.” “Not now that you are a lover, but you would do when you were a husband.\n",
      "She had spoken truly in saying that she knew nothing of that boisterous love which was now tormenting him and making him gloomy; but nevertheless she loved him.\n",
      "There would have been no outward show of baffled love,--none even in the colour of her cheeks; for such was the nature of her temperament.\n",
      "Day by day she began to think that his love, though boisterous as she had at first called it, was more deep-seated than she had believed.\n",
      "Though he said so loudly that this waiting for four years was an impossibility, he spoke of no course that would be more possible,--except that evidently impossible course of an early marriage.\n",
      "And thus, while he with redoubled vehemence charged her with coldness and want of love, her love waxed warmer and warmer, and his happiness became the chief object of her thoughts.\n",
      "Her promise that she would never throw him over was the warmest word of love that she had ever spoken, but even that was said in her own quiet, unimpassioned way.\n",
      "There was in it but very little show of love, though there might be an assurance of constancy.\n",
      "“Well, my love?” “Have you spoken to Uncle Hatto about this?” “No, dear; not since that day when your papa and I first went to him.\n",
      "When he, Herbert, was willing to do so much to prove his love,--when he was ready to sacrifice all the little comforts of comparative wealth to which he had been accustomed, in order that she might be his companion and wife,--did it not behove her to give some proof of her love also?\n",
      "He had made the house what it was, and had taken his brother into partnership when that brother married.\n",
      "“Is Uncle Hatto inside?” she asked; and the answer was given to her by her own lover.\n",
      "“Uncle Hatto,” she began, rushing at once into the middle of her affair, “you know, I believe, that I am engaged to marry Herbert Onslow?” “I know no such thing,” said he.\n",
      "“Perhaps you may think all this very foolish,” said Isa, who, in spite of her resolves to do so, was hardly able to look up gallantly into her uncle’s face as she thus talked of her own love affairs.\n",
      "“I also think that a long engagement is a foolish thing, and so does Herbert.” “But he wants to marry at once.” “Yes, he wants to marry--perhaps not at once, but soon.” “And I suppose you have come to say that you want the same thing.” Isa blushed ever so faintly as she commenced her answer.\n",
      "When two people love each other, it is natural that each should wish that which the other earnestly desires.” “Oh, very natural, my dear, that you should wish to get married!” “Uncle Hatto, I did not think that you would be unkind to me, though I knew that you would be stern.” “Well, go on.\n",
      "Even from my own mother I have not wanted them;--not wanted them faster than they seemed to come without any asking.” “No, no; you have been a good girl.” “I have been a happy girl; and quite happy with those I loved, and with what Providence had given me.\n",
      "He has asked me whether I could love him, and I have told him I could.\n",
      "He has loved me now for two years----” “Psha!” “And whether it be wise or foolish, I have sanctioned it.\n",
      "Therefore I am bound to do for him anything that a girl may do for the man she loves; and, as I knew of no other resource, I come to you to help me.” “And he, sitting out there, knows what you are saying.” “Most certainly not.\n",
      "Why did she not take to one of her own country?” Isa, as she passed through the bank, smiled sweetly on her father, and then smiled sweetly at her lover, nodding to him with a pleasant kindly nod.\n",
      "If he could have heard all that had passed at that interview, how much more he would have known of her than he now knew, and how proud he would have been of her love.\n",
      "If I could see him happy, I could watch him and love him, and be happy also.\n",
      "To her also that state of quiescence which Isa had so long affected seemed to be the proper state at which a maiden’s heart should stand till after her marriage vows had been pronounced.\n",

      "But when you are going to foreign courts, what are you to do?\n",
      "If you have got those sort of things you must wear them.” As I was not myself possessed of anything of that sort, and had no intention of going to any foreign court, I could not argue the matter with her.\n",
      "My daughter,--by a former marriage,--is English also.\n",

      "Pension him liberally, and let Gabriel Betteredge have his place.” On the Tuesday as it might be, Sir John says, “My lady, the bailiff is pensioned liberally; and Gabriel Betteredge has got his place.” You hear more than enough of married people living together miserably.\n",

      "That is married life, according to my experience of it.\n",
      "Before I had occupied myself with that extraordinary book five minutes, I came on a comforting bit (page one hundred and fifty-eight), as follows: “Today we love, what tomorrow we hate.” I saw my way clear directly.\n",
      "In two words, this was how the thing happened: My lady’s eldest sister married the celebrated Mr. Blake—equally famous for his great riches, and his great suit at law.\n",
      "Concluding to set myself in the warm summer air next—seeing that what is good for old claret is equally good for old age—I took up my beehive chair to go out into the back court, when I was stopped by hearing a sound like the soft beating of a drum, on the terrace in front of my lady’s residence.\n",
      "On my side, I returned to my beehive chair, and set myself down on the sunny side of the court, and fell (if the truth must be owned), not exactly into a sleep, but into the next best thing to it.\n",

      "The men wouldn’t let him into their clubs; the women—more than one—whom he wanted to marry, refused him; friends and relations got too near-sighted to see him in the street.\n",
      "Nothing in this world, Betteredge, is probable unless it appeals to our own trumpery experience; and we only believe in a romance when we see it in a newspaper.” It was plain to me from this, that Mr. Franklin thought his father’s notion about the Colonel hasty and wrong.\n",
      "Try that sort of answer when your wife or your daughter next worries you with an awkward question at an awkward time, and depend on the natural sweetness of women for kissing and making it up again at the next opportunity.\n",
      "In came Penelope—with the natural sweetness of women—to kiss and make it up again; and—with the natural curiosity of women—to ask another question.\n",
      "Rosanna has fallen in love with Mr. Franklin Blake at first sight!” You have heard of beautiful young ladies falling in love at first sight, and have thought it natural enough.\n",
      "But a housemaid out of a reformatory, with a plain face and a deformed shoulder, falling in love, at first sight, with a gentleman who comes on a visit to her mistress’s house, match me that, in the way of an absurdity, out of any story-book in Christendom, if you can!\n",
      "Miss Rachel then covered the surface, under his directions and with his help, with patterns and devices—griffins, birds, flowers, cupids, and such like—copied from designs made by a famous Italian painter, whose name escapes me: the one, I mean, who stocked the world with Virgin Maries, and had a sweetheart at the baker’s.\n",
      "Others (led by me) admitted it was likely enough Miss Rachel might be married; but we doubted (for reasons which will presently appear) whether her bridegroom would be Mr. Franklin Blake.\n",
      "That Mr. Franklin was in love, on his side, nobody who saw and heard him could doubt.\n",

      "My lady’s second sister (don’t be alarmed; we are not going very deep into family matters this time)—my lady’s second sister, I say, had a disappointment in love; and taking a husband afterwards, on the neck or nothing principle, made what they call a misalliance.\n",

      "He loved everybody.\n",
      "And everybody loved _him_.\n",

      "As I went out, Mr. Godfrey said, “Dear old Betteredge, I have the truest regard for him!” He was embracing his sisters, and ogling Miss Rachel, while he honoured me with that testimony of affection.\n",
      "Something like a stock of love to draw on _there!_ Mr. Franklin was a perfect savage by comparison with him.\n",

      "Those two sat on either side of Miss Rachel, who, as queen of the day, was naturally the great attraction of the party.\n",
      "She dropped her head, and said in a very low voice, “My beloved husband is no more.” Unluckily Mr. Candy, hearing nothing, and miles away from suspecting the truth, went on across the table louder and politer than ever.\n",
      "“The Professor may not be aware,” says he, “that the card of a member of the College will admit him, on any day but Sunday, between the hours of ten and four.” Mrs. Threadgall dropped her head right into her tucker, and, in a lower voice still, repeated the solemn words, “My beloved husband is no more.” I winked hard at Mr. Candy across the table.\n",

      "“I am sorry to put you to any inconvenience, sir, for a mere formality; but the example of their betters will do wonders in reconciling the servants to this inquiry.” Mr. Godfrey, after taking leave of my lady, in a most sympathising manner, left a farewell message for Miss Rachel, the terms of which made it clear to my mind that he had not taken No for an answer, and that he meant to put the marriage question to her once more, at the next opportunity.\n",
      "“It isn’t very likely, with her personal appearance, that she has got a lover.\n",

      "Miss Rachel, with all her faults, had been, to my mind, the dearest and prettiest and best young mistress that ever an old servant waited on, and loved.\n",
      "He had remembered my telling him that the girl was in love with Mr. Franklin; and he had calculated on _that_, when he appealed to Mr. Franklin’s interest in Rosanna—in Rosanna’s hearing.\n",

      "Asked if she knew what had led her fellow-servant to destroy herself, my daughter answered (as you will foresee) that it was for love of Mr. Franklin Blake.\n",

      "The truth is, that women try marriage as a Refuge, far more numerously than they are willing to admit; and, what is more, they find that marriage has justified their confidence in it.\n",
      "You may marry some other man, some years hence.\n",
      "Or you may marry the man, dearest, who is now at your feet, and who prizes your respect and admiration above the love of any other woman on the face of the earth.” “Gently, Godfrey!\n",
      "I tell you again, I am miserable enough and desperate enough, if you say another word, to marry you on your own terms.\n",
      "Do my father and mother live unhappily together?” “Far from it—so far as I can see.” “When my mother was a girl, Rachel (it is no secret in the family), she had loved as you love—she had given her heart to a man who was unworthy of her.\n",
      "She married my father, respecting him, admiring him, but nothing more.\n",

      "At any rate, in ten days from my aunt’s death, the secret of the marriage-engagement was no secret at all within the circle of the family, and the grand question for Mr. Ablewhite senior—another confirmed castaway!—was how to make himself and his authority most agreeable to the wealthy young lady who was going to marry his son.\n",
      "The church-bells were going for a week-day service; they suggested a word of affectionate remonstrance on my part.\n",
      "We discussed family affairs and future plans—always excepting that one future plan which was to end in her marriage.\n",
      "This was, of itself, enough to encourage me to take her future conversion in hand—beginning with a few words of earnest warning directed against the hasty formation of the marriage tie, and so getting on to higher things.\n",
      "I had prepared quite a little Paradise for my beloved Rachel—and here was the Serpent already!\n",
      "“Tired, love?” I inquired.\n",
      "“Do you know, love,” I said, “I had an odd fancy, yesterday, about Mr. Bruff?\n",
      "In my dauntless zeal for her welfare, I ran the great risk, and openly alluded to her marriage engagement.\n",
      "She checked herself—laid her head back on the pillow—considered a minute—and then answered in these remarkable words: “_I shall never marry Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite._” It was my turn to start at that.\n",
      "“The marriage is considered by the whole family as a settled thing!” “Mr.\n",
      "I had reckoned on leading her to higher things by means of a little earnest exhortation on the subject of her marriage.\n",
      "And now, if she was to be believed, no such event as her marriage was to take place at all.\n",
      "Supposing Rachel really broke off the marriage, on which the Ablewhites, father and son, counted as a settled thing, what would be the result?\n",
      "I have an indistinct remembrance that he was very affectionate.\n",
      "I don’t know why I made a proposal of marriage to Miss Verinder.\n",
      "She has told me with her own lips (this, dear lady, is between ourselves) that she loves another man, and that her only idea in marrying me is to try and put that other man out of her head.\n",
      "And it was equally easy to recognise the welcome reappearance of his own finer nature in the horror with which he recoiled from the idea of a marriage with Rachel, and in the charming eagerness which he showed to return to his Ladies and his Poor.\n",
      "When I answered for a loving reception of him at the Mothers’ Small-Clothes, the grateful heart of our Christian Hero overflowed.\n",
      "It has also reached my ears, that his anxiety to recover his place in my estimation has been attributed in certain quarters, to a mercenary eagerness to make his peace (through me) with a venerable committee-woman at the Mothers’ Small-Clothes, abundantly blessed with the goods of this world, and a beloved and intimate friend of my own.\n",
      "In less than a month from the time of which I am now writing, events in the money-market (which diminished even _my_ miserable little income) forced me into foreign exile, and left me with nothing but a loving remembrance of Mr. Godfrey which the slander of the world has assailed, and assailed in vain.\n",
      "I went downstairs to luncheon, naturally anxious to see how Rachel was affected by her release from her marriage engagement.\n",
      "It appeared to me—but I own I am a poor authority in such matters—that the recovery of her freedom had set her thinking again of that other man whom she loved, and that she was furious with herself for not being able to control a revulsion of feeling of which she was secretly ashamed.\n",
      "But I knew the importance which his worldly greed attached to his son’s marriage with Miss Verinder—and I felt a positive conviction (do what Mr. Godfrey might to prevent it) that we should see him the next day.\n",
      "Mr. Ablewhite stood up in the middle of the room, with his bald head much pinker than I had ever seen it yet, and addressed himself in the most affectionate manner to his niece.\n",
      "“Some weeks ago,” pursued the old gentleman, “my son informed me that Miss Verinder had done him the honour to engage herself to marry him.\n",
      "“I did engage myself to marry him.” “Very frankly answered!” said Mr. Ablewhite.\n",
      "If he told you that I proposed breaking off our marriage engagement, and that he agreed on his side—he told you the truth.” The self-registering thermometer at the top of Mr. Ablewhite’s bald head began to indicate a rise of temper.\n",
      "“I am to understand, then,” he said, “that your marriage engagement is broken off?” “You are to understand that, Mr. Ablewhite, if you please.” “I am also to take it as a matter of fact that the proposal to withdraw from the engagement came, in the first instance, from _you?_” “It came, in the first instance, from me.\n",
      "Your cursed family pride is insulting Godfrey, as it insulted _me_ when I married your aunt.\n",
      "Her family—her beggarly family—turned their backs on her for marrying an honest man, who had made his own place and won his own fortune.\n",
      "I wasn’t good enough for the Herncastles, when _I_ married.\n",
      "“As an affectionate well-wisher and friend,” I proceeded, “and as one long accustomed to arouse, convince, prepare, enlighten, and fortify others, permit me to take the most pardonable of all liberties—the liberty of composing your mind.” He began to recover himself; he was on the point of breaking out—he _would_ have broken out, with anybody else.\n",
      "That was Mr. Ablewhite’s revenge on Rachel, for refusing to marry his son!\n",
      "I hope I shall never see you or your tracts again.” She went back to Rachel and kissed her.\n",
      "What can I do for you?” Consistently perverse in everything—capricious and unreasonable in all the actions of her life—Rachel melted into tears at those commonplace words, and returned her aunt’s kiss in silence.\n",
      "Rachel, dearest Rachel, I offer you my modest home; come to London by the next train, love, and share it with me!” Mr. Bruff said nothing.\n",
      "You were at the funeral, Mr. Bruff; you saw how everybody loved her; you saw the poor helpless people crying at her grave over the loss of their best friend.\n",
      "Miss Verinder had her own private reason for breaking her marriage engagement—and I was at the bottom of it.\n",
      "The true story of the broken marriage engagement comes first in point of time, and must therefore take the first place in the present narrative.\n",
      "Neither she, nor her husband (if she married), could raise sixpence, either on the property in land, or on the property in money.\n",
      "Hardly a week had passed since I had heard (to my surprise and distress) of Miss Verinder’s proposed marriage.\n",
      "I had the sincerest admiration and affection for her; and I had been inexpressibly grieved when I heard that she was about to throw herself away on Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite.\n",
      "And now, here was the man—whom I had always believed to be a smooth-tongued impostor—justifying the very worst that I had thought of him, and plainly revealing the mercenary object of the marriage, on his side!\n",
      "If that position was not a desperate one, it would be well worth his while to marry Miss Verinder for her income alone.\n",
      "In the former event, if I remained silent, I should be conniving at a marriage which would make her miserable for life.\n",
      "“May I speak to you,” I asked, “about your marriage engagement?” “Yes,” she said, indifferently, “if you have nothing more interesting to talk about.” “Will you forgive an old friend and servant of your family, Miss Rachel, if I venture on asking whether your heart is set on this marriage?” “I am marrying in despair, Mr. Bruff—on the chance of dropping into some sort of stagnant happiness which may reconcile me to my life.” Strong language!\n",
      "and suggestive of something below the surface, in the shape of a romance.\n",
      "“_His_ heart must be set on the marriage at any rate?” “He says so, and I suppose I ought to believe him.\n",
      "He would hardly marry me, after what I have owned to him, unless he was fond of me.” Poor thing!\n",
      "the bare idea of a man marrying her for his own selfish and mercenary ends had never entered her head.\n",
      "If you hear any rumours of my marriage when you get back to London contradict them at once, on my authority.” “Have you resolved to break your engagement?” I asked.\n",
      "But this was the first occasion on which I had ever found myself advising a young lady how to obtain her release from a marriage engagement.\n",
      "She was then to add that their marriage, after what she had discovered, was a simple impossibility—and she was to put it to him, whether he thought it wisest to secure her silence by falling in with her views, or to force her, by opposing them, to make the motive under which she was acting generally known.\n",
      "I have promised to marry that man.\n",
      "“He has been intimate enough with me to ask me to be his wife.\n",
      "If I am told that this is a mere speculation, I ask, in my turn, what other theory will account for his giving up a marriage which would have maintained him in splendour for the rest of his life?\n",
      "In justification of the highly unprofessional sacrifice to mere curiosity which I thus made, permit me to remind anybody who may read these lines, that no living person (in England, at any rate) can claim to have had such an intimate connexion with the romance of the Indian Diamond as mine has been.\n",
      "“The clairvoyance in this case is simply a development of the romantic side of the Indian character.\n",
      "It was all written in one paragraph, without any attempt at punctuation, thus: “To the three Indian men living with the lady called Macann at Frizinghall in Yorkshire.” The Hindoo characters followed; and the English translation appeared at the end, expressed in these mysterious words: “In the name of the Regent of the Night, whose seat is on the Antelope, whose arms embrace the four corners of the earth.\n",
      "Mr. Bruff did not, at that time, feel himself at liberty to inform me of the motives which had privately influenced Rachel and Godfrey Ablewhite in recalling the marriage promise, on either side.\n",
      "It was relief enough to me, after the jealous disappointment caused by hearing that she had ever contemplated being Godfrey’s wife, to know that reflection had convinced her of acting rashly, and that she had effected her own release from her marriage engagement.\n",
      "I love you.” The letter dropped from my hand.\n",
      "I did these strange things, because I loved you.\n",
      "You were like a lover in a dream.\n",
      "I believe I found out you were in love with her, before you knew it yourself.\n",
      "I was mad enough to love you; and I couldn’t even attract your notice.\n",
      "I used to kiss the pillow on which your head had rested all night.\n",
      "And, God help us all!” he added, in a lower tone, “it’s no less natural in _her_.” I proceed to copy the continuation of the letter from the original, in my own possession:— “Having determined to keep the nightgown, and to see what use my love, or my revenge (I hardly know which) could turn it to in the future, the next thing to discover was how to keep it without the risk of being found out.\n",
      "if you have ever loved, you will understand how it was that all my courage cooled, when I walked into the room, and found myself in your presence.\n"

      "What a singular selection--what a queer infatuation!\n",
      "He exclaimed that Blanche Evers was exactly the sort of girl that men of Gordon Wright's stamp always ended by falling in love with, and that poor Gordon knew very much better what he was about in this case than he had done in trying to solve the deep problem of a comfortable life with Angela Vivian.\n",
      "Gordon had engaged himself to marry, and our critical hero had not a grain of fault to find with this resolution.\n",

      "If you say that again you will make me repent of having married the best fellow in the world.\n",
      "He saw, too--with the fact made more vivid by Gordon's standing there beside her in his manly sincerity and throwing it into contrast--that Blanche was the same little posturing coquette of a Blanche whom, at Baden, he would have treated it as a broad joke that Gordon Wright should dream of marrying.\n",

      "He was disgusted with the idea of such a want of gratitude; for, if Gordon Wright had loved Miss Evers for herself, the young lady might certainly have discovered the intrinsic value of so disinterested a suitor.\n",
      "Blanche had an affection for him now, however; Bernard saw no reason to doubt that, and certainly she would have been a very flimsy creature indeed if she had not been touched by his inexhaustible kindness.\n",
      "She had every conceivable indulgence, and if she married him for his money, at least she had got what she wanted.\n",
      "I am very fond of Gordon, and yet I am not blinded by affection, as regards his personal appearance.\n",
      "One would think he had done me an injury in marrying me, and that he wanted to make up for it.\n",
      "He simply kissed me.\n",
      "He kisses me about seventeen times a day.\n",
      "I suppose it 's very improper for a woman to tell any one how often her husband kisses her; but, as you happen to have seen him do it, I don't suppose you will be scandalized.\n",
      "That 's why I was afraid to tell Gordon--because when I was married I had such a lot of things; I was supposed to have dresses enough to last for a year.\n",
      "If he thinks I am extravagant, he can easily stop kissing me.\n",
      "Bernard was the restless and professionless mortal that we know, wandering in life from one vague experiment to another, constantly gratified and never satisfied, to whom no imperious finality had as yet presented itself; and, nevertheless, for a time he contrived to limit his horizon to the passing hour, and to make a good many hours pass in the drawing-room of a demonstrative flirt.\n",
      "For Mrs. Gordon was a flirt; that had become tolerably obvious.\n",
      "Blanche flirted, in fact, more or less with all men, but her opportunity for playing her harmless batteries upon Bernard were of course exceptionally large.\n",
      "I don't know what he married me for.\n",
      "At the end of some three hours, Bernard arrived at a little watering-place which lay close upon the shore, in the embrace of a pair of white-armed cliffs.\n",
      "This is what Bernard believed that Angela Vivian saw in the fact that by giving his friend a bad account of her he had prevented her making an opulent marriage.\n",
      "\"It is all the more singular, that one of the last persons I saw in America was your charming friend Blanche, who married Gordon Wright.\n",
      "Of course Blanche was silly; but, equally of course, this young lady's perception of it was quickened by Blanche's having married a rich man whom she herself might have married.\n",
      "It had neither the liberal illumination, the distinguished frequenters, nor the superior music which formed the attraction of that celebrated spot; but it had a modest animation of its own, in which the starlight on the open sea took the place of clustered lamps, and the mighty resonance of the waves performed the function of an orchestra.\n",
      "He was in love with Angela Vivian, and his love was a throbbing passion!\n",
      "It was not a feeling to which even a man of Bernard Longueville's easy power of extracting the savour from a sensation could rapidly habituate himself, and for the rest of that night it was far from making of our hero the happy man that a lover just coming to self-consciousness is supposed to be.\n",
      "Trouble it was, though this seems an odd name for the consciousness of a bright enchantment; and the first thing that reason, definitely consulted, told him about the matter was that he had been in love with Angela Vivian any time these three years.\n",
      "The shadow had dropped away and nothing was left but the beauty of his love, which seemed to shine in the freshness of the early day.\n",
      "He must have seemed to them wanting in civility, to spend a whole bright Sunday without apparently troubling his head about them, and if the unlucky fact of his being in love with the girl were a reason for doing his duty, it was at least not a reason for being rude.\n",
      "\"Dear little woman,\" he said to himself, \"she wants to marry her daughter still--only now she wants to marry her to me!\"\n",
      "He wished to show her that he understood her, and he was on the point of seizing her hand, to do he did n't know what--to hold it, to press it, to kiss it--when he heard the sharp twang of the bell at the door of the little apartment.\n",
      "Her mother went to her and kissed her.\n",
      "\"I have been in love with you for three years.\"\n",
      "I loved you long before I knew it--before I ventured or presumed to know it.\n",
      "I love you as my life--I beg you to listen to me!\"\n",
      "In reality I was in love with you.\n",
      "I love you, and I offer you everything that belongs to me in this world.\"\n",
      "\"I said you were a dangerous woman to marry,\" he went on deliberately.\n",
      "I believed that you were ready to marry him, and yet I saw--I thought I saw--\" and Bernard paused again.\n",
      "\"Thoroughly good, and dear, doubtless to his wife, the affectionate Blanche.\"\n"

      "\"My own Mrs. Vivian,\" she cried, \"is she married?\"\n",
      "Angela and I are not married, but we hope to be before long.\n",
      "Angela went to her and kissed her.\n",
      "Then she folded her in a prolonged, an exaggerated, embrace.\n",
      "Meanwhile she congratulated each of her friends half a dozen times; she kissed Mrs. Vivian again, she almost kissed Bernard; she inquired about details; she longed to hear all about Angela's \"things.\"\n",
      "\"Poor Mr. Wright had his reasons,\" Mrs. Vivian suggested, and then she ventured to explain: \"He still cares for Angela, and it was painful to him to talk about her marrying some one else.\"\n",

      "\"He is intensely in love with his wife!\"\n",
      "They are in love with each other, and yet they both do nothing but hide it.\n",
      "He is not in the least in love with poor me--not to-day any more than he was three years ago.\n",
      "If he would take her a little more seriously--it 's an immense pity he married her because she was silly!--she would be flattered by it, and she would try and deserve it.\n",
      "But she would do it out of spite--not out of affection for the Captain, who must be got immediately out of the way.\n",
      "Just see the effect of this abominable passion of love, which you have been crying up to me so!\n",
      "She wished to be more than that, and she took refuge in flirting, simply to excite his jealousy and make him feel strongly about her.\n",

      "There is the story of one’s hero, and then, thanks to the intimate connexion of things, the story of one’s story itself.\n",
      "The thing was to be so much this worthy’s intimate adventure that even the projection of his consciousness upon it from beginning to end without intermission or deviation would probably still leave a part of its value for him, and _a fortiori_ for ourselves, unexpressed.\n",
      "Had I, meanwhile, made him at once hero and historian, endowed him with the romantic privilege of the “first person”—the darkest abyss of romance this, inveterately, when enjoyed on the grand scale—variety, and many other queer matters as well, might have been smuggled in by a back door.\n",
      "She knew even intimate things about him that he hadn’t yet told her and perhaps never would.\n",
      "He went once more to the garden; he looked into the public room, found Miss Gostrey writing letters and backed out; he roamed, fidgeted and wasted time; but he was to have his more intimate session with his friend before the evening closed.\n",
      "Dinner and the subsequent stroll by moonlight—a dream, on Strether’s part, of romantic effects rather prosaically merged in a mere missing of thicker coats—had measurably intervened, and this midnight conference was the result of Waymarsh’s having (when they were free, as he put it, of their fashionable friend) found the smoking-room not quite what he wanted, and yet bed what he wanted less.\n",
      "Alas nothing so little resembled floating as the rigour with which, on the edge of his bed, he hugged his posture of prolonged impermanence.\n",
      "“Well, _I_ won’t marry you!” “Neither, when it comes to that—!” But the visitor had already laughed and escaped.\n",
      "He had his association indeed with the ruche, but it was rather imperfectly romantic.\n",
      "He had married, in the far-away years, so young as to have missed the time natural in Boston for taking girls to the Museum; and it was absolutely true of hint that—even after the close of the period of conscious detachment occupying the centre of his life, the grey middle desert of the two deaths, that of his wife and that, ten years later, of his boy—he had never taken any one anywhere.\n",
      "Here, on the other hand, apart from the personal and the sexual range—which might be greater or less—a series of strong stamps had been applied, as it were, from without; stamps that his observation played with as, before a glass case on a table, it might have passed from medal to medal and from copper to gold.\n",
      "But has he only his mother?” “He has also a sister, older than himself and married; and they’re both remarkably fine women.” “Very handsome, you mean?” This promptitude—almost, as he might have thought, this precipitation, gave him a brief drop; but he came up again.\n",
      "She married, however, extremely young.” “And is wonderful,” Miss Gostrey asked, “for her age?” Strether seemed to feel with a certain disquiet the pressure of it.\n",
      "“Don’t you call it a good thing to be loved?” “Oh we’re not loved.\n",
      "What you _really_ want to get him home for is to marry him.” “Well, that’s about the size of it.” “Of course,” she said, “it’s rudimentary.\n",
      "He had believed, sailing home again, that he had gained something great, and his theory—with an elaborate innocent plan of reading, digesting, coming back even, every few years—had then been to preserve, cherish and extend it.\n",
      "He was now quite out of it, with his “home,” as Strether figured the place, in the Boulevard Malesherbes, now; which was perhaps why, repairing, not to fail of justice either, to the elder neighbourhood, our friend had felt he could allow for the element of the usual, the immemorial, without courting perturbation.\n",
      "It became at once vivid to him that he had originally had, for a few days, an almost envious vision of the boy’s romantic privilege.\n",
      "Miss Gostrey had a fireside; she had told him of it, and it was something that doubtless awaited him; but Miss Gostrey hadn’t yet arrived—she mightn’t arrive for days; and the sole attenuation of his excluded state was his vision of the small, the admittedly secondary hotel in the bye-street from the Rue de la Paix, in which her solicitude for his purse had placed him, which affected him somehow as all indoor chill, glass-roofed court and slippery staircase, and which, by the same token, expressed the presence of Waymarsh even at times when Waymarsh might have been certain to be round at the bank.\n",
      "If I’m squared where’s my marriage?\n",
      "He wondered what he was to think exactly of either of his new friends; since the young man, Chad’s intimate and deputy, had, in thus constituting the scene, practised so much more subtly than he had been prepared for, and since in especial Miss Barrace, surrounded clearly by every consideration, hadn’t scrupled to figure as a familiar object.\n",

      "He liked the ingenuous compatriots—for two or three others soon gathered; he liked the delicate daubs and the free discriminations—involving references indeed, involving enthusiasms and execrations that made him, as they said, sit up; he liked above all the legend of good-humoured poverty, of mutual accommodation fairly raised to the romantic, that he soon read into the scene.\n",
      "She hadn’t dined with him, and it was characteristic of their relation that she had made him embrace her refusal without in the least understanding it.\n",
      "It was a touch that gave the note of the familiar—the intimate and the belated—to their quiet colloquy; and it was indeed by some such trivial aid that Strether became aware at the same moment of something else.\n",
      "It’s like the new edition of an old book that one has been fond of—revised and amended, brought up to date, but not quite the thing one knew and loved.\n",
      "“He ought to get married.\n",
      "And he wants to.” “Wants to marry her?” Again little Bilham waited, and, with a sense that he had information, Strether scarce knew what was coming.\n",
      "She may be old enough.” “Old enough for what?” “Why to marry Chad.\n",
      "“I don’t see why if Mr. Newsome wants to marry the young lady he hasn’t already done it or hasn’t been prepared with some statement to you about it.\n",
      "And if he both wants to marry her and is on good terms with them why isn’t he ‘free’?” Strether, responsively, wondered indeed.\n",
      "“However,” he went on, “his marriage is what his mother most desires—that is if it will help.\n",
      "And oughtn’t _any_ marriage to help?\n",
      "Almost any girl he may marry will have a direct interest in his taking up his chances.\n",
      "Perhaps she’s only ten—but such a little dear that Chad finds himself counting her in as an attraction of the acquaintance.\n",
      "Far back from streets and unsuspected by crowds, reached by a long passage and a quiet court, it was as striking to the unprepared mind, he immediately saw, as a treasure dug up; giving him too, more than anything yet, the note of the range of the immeasurable town and sweeping away, as by a last brave brush, his usual landmarks and terms.\n",
      "Strether had seen in museums—in the Luxembourg as well as, more reverently, later on, in the New York of the billionaires—the work of his hand; knowing too that after an earlier time in his native Rome he had migrated, in mid-career, to Paris, where, with a personal lustre almost violent, he shone in a constellation: all of which was more than enough to crown him, for his guest, with the light, with the romance, of glory.\n",
      "He was in fact quite to cherish his vision of it, to play with it in idle hours; only speaking of it to no one and quite aware he couldn’t have spoken without appearing to talk nonsense.\n",
      "“Pretty well.” This was a category our friend had a feeling for; a light, romantic and mysterious, on the feminine element, in which he enjoyed for a little watching it.\n",
      "“If I ask you about some of the ladies it can’t be then that I may hope, as such a specimen of the rococo, to please them.” “On the contrary they adore—we all adore here—the rococo, and where is there a better setting for it than the whole thing, the pavilion and the garden, together?\n",
      "One does see.” “Chad’s in love with the daughter?” “That’s what I mean.” Strether wondered.\n",
      "Twenty-three years put them both on, no doubt; and Madame de Vionnet—though she had married straight after school—couldn’t be today an hour less than thirty-eight.\n",
      "It was still history for Strether that the Comte de Vionnet—it being also history that the lady in question was a Countess—should now, under Miss Gostrey’s sharp touch, rise before him as a high distinguished polished impertinent reprobate, the product of a mysterious order; it was history, further, that the charming girl so freely sketched by his companion should have been married out of hand by a mother, another figure of striking outline, full of dark personal motive; it was perhaps history most of all that this company was, as a matter of course, governed by such considerations as put divorce out of the question.\n",
      "The girl at the Genevese school, an isolated interesting attaching creature, then both sensitive and violent, audacious but always forgiven, was the daughter of a French father and an English mother who, early left a widow, had married again—tried afresh with a foreigner; in her career with whom she had apparently given her child no example of comfort.\n",
      "She went on at all events to the mention of her having met the young thing—again by some Swiss lake—in her first married state, which had appeared for the few intermediate years not at least violently disturbed.\n",
      "She was another person however—that had been promptly marked—from the small child of nature at the Geneva school, a little person quite made over (as foreign women _were_, compared with American) by marriage.\n",
      "She occupied, his hostess, in the Rue de Bellechasse, the first floor of an old house to which our visitors had had access from an old clean court.\n",
      "The court was large and open, full of revelations, for our friend, of the habit of privacy, the peace of intervals, the dignity of distances and approaches; the house, to his restless sense, was in the high homely style of an elder day, and the ancient Paris that he was always looking for—sometimes intensely felt, sometimes more acutely missed—was in the immemorial polish of the wide waxed staircase and in the fine _boiseries_, the medallions, mouldings, mirrors, great clear spaces, of the greyish-white salon into which he had been shown.\n",
      "It had in fact, as he was now aware, filled all the approaches, hovered in the court as he passed, hung on the staircase as he mounted, sounded in the grave rumble of the old bell, as little electric as possible, of which Chad, at the door, had pulled the ancient but neatly-kept tassel; it formed in short the clearest medium of its particular kind that he had ever breathed.\n",
      "The fire, under the low white marble, undraped and academic, had burnt down to the silver ashes of light wood, one of the windows, at a distance, stood open to the mildness and stillness, out of which, in the short pauses, came the faint sound, pleasant and homely, almost rustic, of a plash and a clatter of _sabots_ from some coach-house on the other side of the court.\n",
      "And the relation profited by a mass of things that were not strictly in it or of it; by the very air in which they sat, by the high cold delicate room, by the world outside and the little plash in the court, by the First Empire and the relics in the stiff cabinets, by matters as far off as those and by others as near as the unbroken clasp of her hands in her lap and the look her expression had of being most natural when her eyes were most fixed.\n",
      "Do you want him,” he then braced himself to ask, “to marry your daughter?” She gave a headshake as noble as it was prompt.\n",
      "“Is your daughter in love with our friend?” “Ah,” she rather startlingly answered, “I wish you’d find out!” He showed his surprise.\n",
      "“To marry Chad.” “Why should she marry Chad?” “Because I’m convinced she’s very fond of him.\n",
      "He’s _not_ in love with her.” “No—but he’s her best friend; after her mother.\n",
      "M. de Vionnet may live for ever.” “So that they can’t marry?” The young man waited a moment.\n",
      "“Not being able to marry is all they’ve with any confidence to look forward to.\n",
      "Then more bravely: “Wouldn’t distance lessen the torment?” But before Strether could reply, “The thing is, you see, Chad ought to marry!” he wound up.\n",
      "“He ought to marry whom?” Little Bilham rose more slowly.\n",
      "“After being in love with her mother?\n",
      "No.” “But isn’t it exactly your idea that he _isn’t_ in love with her mother?” His friend once more had a pause.\n",
      "“Well, he isn’t at any rate in love with Jeanne.” “I dare say not.” “How _can_ he be with any other woman?” “Oh that I admit.\n",
      "But being in love isn’t, you know, here”—little Bilham spoke in friendly reminder—“thought necessary, in strictness, for marriage.” “And what torment—to call a torment—can there ever possibly be with a woman like that?” As if from the interest of his own question Strether had gone on without hearing.\n",
      "She was not a wandering alien, keeping back more than she gave, but one of the familiar, the intimate, the fortunate, for whom these dealings had a method and a meaning.\n",
      "“I love this place, but I’m terrible, in general, for churches.\n",
      "She was romantic for him far beyond what she could have guessed, and again he found his small comfort in the conviction that, subtle though she was, his impression must remain a secret from her.\n",
      "I’m not in a particular hurry, and it will be pleasant to look at it well with you.” He had spoken of the great romancer and the great romance, and of what, to his imagination, they had done for the whole, mentioning to her moreover the exorbitance of his purchase, the seventy blazing volumes that were so out of proportion.\n",
      "“Do you give me your word of honour that if she once has him there she won’t do her best to marry him?” It made her companion, this enquiry, look again a while out at the view; after which he spoke without sharpness.\n",
      "“It’s when she sees for herself what he is that she’ll want to marry him most.” Strether’s attitude, that of due deference to what she said, permitted him to attend for a minute to his luncheon.\n",
      "His being proof against marriage will show what he does make.” “If he _is_ proof, yes”—she accepted the proposition.\n",
      "II He received three days after this a communication from America, in the form of a scrap of blue paper folded and gummed, not reaching him through his bankers, but delivered at his hotel by a small boy in uniform, who, under instructions from the concierge, approached him as he slowly paced the little court.\n",
      "He read his telegram in the court, standing still a long time where he had opened it and giving five minutes afterwards to the renewed study of it.\n",
      "A few minutes later the friends were seated together at dinner; but Strether had meanwhile said nothing about it, and they eventually parted, after coffee in the court, with nothing said on either side.\n",
      "You give her a couple of months of Paris, which she hasn’t seen, if I’m not mistaken, since just after she was married, and which I’m sure she wants but the pretext to visit.” Chad listened, but with all his own knowledge of the world.\n",
      "They descended slowly together and had, in the court of the hotel, some further talk, of which the upshot was that they presently separated.\n",
      "He hastily picked up Strether, at the hotel, for this purpose, and he even, with easy pleasantry, suggested the attendance of Waymarsh as well—Waymarsh, at the moment his cab rattled up, being engaged, under Strether’s contemplative range, in a grave perambulation of the familiar court.\n",
      "Strether had woven this web of cheerfulness while they waited in the court for Chad; he had sat smoking cigarettes to keep himself quiet while, caged and leonine, his fellow traveller paced and turned before him.\n",
      "He repeated to Chad what he had been saying in the court to Waymarsh; how there was no doubt whatever that his sister would find the latter a kindred spirit, no doubt of the alliance, based on an exchange of views, that the pair would successfully strike up.\n",
      "She wasn’t the mere maiden, and yet was only as much married as that quantity came to.\n",
      "It was on the cards that the child _might_ be tremulously in love, and this conviction now flickered up not a bit the less for his disliking to think of it, for its being, in a complicated situation, a complication the more, and for something indescribable in Mamie, something at all events straightway lent her by his own mind, something that gave her value, gave her intensity and purpose, as the symbol of an opposition.\n",
      "Only Strether’s imagination, as always, worked, and he asked himself if this side of life were not somehow connected, for those who figured on it with the fact of marriage.\n",
      "Would _his_ relation to it, had he married ten years before, have become now the same as Pocock’s?\n",
      "Might it even become the same should he marry in a few months?\n",
      "He himself Lambert Strether, _was_ as yet in some degree—which was an odd situation for a man; but it kept coming back to him in a whimsical way that he should perhaps find his marriage had cost him his place.\n",
      "She’s acting moreover now for her mother, and that fixes the scale.” Then he wound up, opening all his senses to it, with a renewed embrace of pleasant Paris.\n",
      "“Ah don’t be so charming to me!—for it makes us intimate, and after all what _is_ between us when I’ve been so tremendously on my guard and have seen you but half a dozen times?” He recognised once more the perverse law that so inveterately governed his poor personal aspects: it would be exactly _like_ the way things always turned out for him that he should affect Mrs. Pocock and Waymarsh as launched in a relation in which he had really never been launched at all.\n",
      "“It’s he, I gather, who has learnt to know his Paris, and to love it, better than any one ever before in so short a time; so that between him and your brother, when it comes to the point, how can you possibly want for good guidance?\n",
      "Above all there’s no doubt she does love Strether.” “Ah but we all do that—we all love Strether: it isn’t a merit!” their fellow visitor laughed, keeping to her idea with a good conscience at which our friend was aware that he marvelled, though he trusted also for it, as he met her exquisitely expressive eyes, to some later light.\n",
      "I meet a number of charming friends”—and her voice seemed to caress that description of these persons.\n",
      "“I wish indeed I could offer you my poor child as a dazzling attraction: it would make one’s position simple enough!\n"

      "The oddity, the originality, the poetry—he didn’t know what to call it—of Chad’s connexion reaffirmed for him its romantic side.\n",
      "You’re not stupid.” And then abruptly, as if bringing it out were somehow founded on that fact: “We’re marrying Jeanne.” It affected him on the spot as a move in a game, and he was even then not without the sense that that wasn’t the way Jeanne should be married.\n",
      "For all the trouble Monsieur de Vionnet will ever take!” It was the first time she had spoken to him of her husband, and he couldn’t have expressed how much more intimate with her it suddenly made him feel.\n",
      "I quite adore him.” Strether just made sure.\n",
      "“And do you suppose _he_—who loves her so—would do anything reckless or cruel?” He wondered what he supposed.\n",
      "“He wouldn’t hurt her for the world, nor—assuming she marries at all—risk anything that might make against her happiness.\n",
      "But is her childhood’s friend,” she asked, “permitting himself recklessly to flirt with her?” “No—not that.\n",
      "“You mean she has fallen in love?” “I mean she wonders if she hasn’t—and it serves all her purpose.” “It has indeed,” Maria laughed, “served women’s purposes before!” “Yes—for giving in.\n",
      "“Is _he_ in love?” Strether looked at her a long time; then looked all about the room; then came a little nearer.\n",
      "The Parisian place, the feverish hour, the putting before her of a hundred francs’ worth of food and drink, which they’ll scarcely touch—all that’s the dear man’s own romance; the expensive kind, expensive in francs and centimes, in which he abounds.\n",
      "It would be nicer.” “Nicer than being tied up to Marie?” “Yes—than the discomfort of an attachment to a person he can never hope, short of a catastrophe, to marry.\n",
      "“And through being in love too?” On which with a smile that struck him as wonderful Mamie had a wonderful answer.\n",
      "“Know that poor little Jeanne doesn’t know what’s the matter with her?” It was as near as they came to saying that she was probably in love with Chad; but it was quite near enough for what Strether wanted; which was to be confirmed in his certitude that, whether in love or not, she appealed to something large and easy in the girl before him.\n",
      "You once said to me”—he followed this further—“that you held Chad should marry.\n",
      "I didn’t see then so well as I know now that you meant he should marry Miss Pocock.\n",
      "You can help me that way.” “Help you by thinking he should _not_ marry?” “Not marry at all events Mamie.” “And who then?” “Ah,” Strether returned, “that I’m not obliged to say.\n",
      "But he needn’t marry at all—I’m at any rate not obliged to provide for it.\n",
      "“Obliged to provide for my marrying?” “Yes—after all I’ve done to you!” The young man weighed it.\n",
      "But all the same,” he went on, “I wish awfully you’d marry Mamie Pocock yourself.” Little Bilham laughed out.\n",
      "I want”—and our friend spoke now with a yearning that was really earnest—“at least to have done _that_.” “To have married me off—without a penny?” “Well, I shan’t live long; and I give you my word, now and here, that I’ll leave you every penny of my own.\n",
      "“You want me to marry as a convenience to Chad?” “No,” Strether debated—“_he_ doesn’t care whether you marry or not.\n",
      "It’s awkward for a man when a girl’s in love with him.” “Ah but she isn’t—now.” Little Bilham sat staring before him; then he sprang up as if his friend’s penetration, recurrent and insistent, made him really after all too nervous.\n",
      "There’s nothing left for her to do.” “Not even to love him?” “She would have loved him better as she originally believed him.” Strether wondered.\n",
      "We love him here—he’s charming.” “It’s beautiful,” said Strether, “the way you all can simplify when you will.” But she gave it to him back.\n",
      "He had made sure, through the expanse of glass exposed to the court, that they would be alone; and there was now in fact that about him that pretty well took up the room.\n",
      "I shall walk up and down in the court there—dear little old court which we’ve each bepaced so, this last couple of months, to the tune of our flights and our drops, our hesitations and our plunges: I shall hang about there, all impatience and excitement, please let Sarah know, till she graciously presents herself.\n",
      "He had done exactly what he had given Waymarsh his word for—had walked and re-walked the court while he awaited her advent; acquiring in this exercise an amount of light that affected him at the time as flooding the scene.\n",
      "Waymarsh _had_, however, uttered the request that she might find him mild, and while hanging about the court before her arrival he had turned over with zeal the different ways in which he could be so.\n",
      "“I call it hideous.” Her departure had been for some minutes marked as imminent, and she was already at the door that stood open to the court, from the threshold of which she delivered herself of this judgement.\n",
      "I do think that!” She passed out as she spoke and took her way straight across the court, beyond which, separated from them by the deep arch of the _porte-cochère_ the low victoria that had conveyed her from her own hotel was drawn up.\n",
      "He stopped halfway; he stood there in the court only seeing her go and noting that she gave him no other look.\n",
      "Sarah passed out of sight in the sunny street while, planted there in the centre of the comparatively grey court, he continued merely to look before him.\n",
      "Are you really in love with her?” Maria threw off.\n",
      "The conditions had nowhere so asserted their difference from those of Woollett as they appeared to him to assert it in the little court of the Cheval Blanc while he arranged with his hostess for a comfortable climax.\n",
      "The windows were all open, their redundant hangings swaying a little, and he heard once more, from the empty court, the small plash of the fountain.\n",
      "From beyond this, and as from a great distance—beyond the court, beyond the _corps de logis_ forming the front—came, as if excited and exciting, the vague voice of Paris.\n",
      "Strether felt, oddly enough, before these facts, freshly and consentingly passive; they again so rubbed it into him that the couple thus fixing his attention were intimate, that his intervention had absolutely aided and intensified their intimacy, and that in fine he must accept the consequence of that.\n",
      "I don’t ask you to raise your little finger for me again, nor do I wish so much as to mention to you what we’ve talked of before, either my danger or my safety, or his mother, or his sister, or the girl he may marry, or the fortune he may make or miss, or the right or the wrong, of any kind, he may do.\n",
      "This was not the discomposure of last night; that had quite passed—such discomposures were a detail; the real coercion was to see a man ineffably adored.\n",
      "He had been great already, as he knew, at postponements; but he had only to get afresh into the rhythm of one to feel its fine attraction.\n",
      "This retreat was at the back of the house, with a view of a scrap of old garden that had been saved from modern ravage; and though he had on more than one other occasion had his legs under its small and peculiarly polished table of hospitality, the place had never before struck him as so sacred to pleasant knowledge, to intimate charm, to antique order, to a neatness that was almost august.\n",

      "But it is equally true that he was affectionate in the domestic circle, and, when moved by wisely applied remonstrance, sincerely penitent for sins committed under temptation that overpowered him.\n",
      "Her next inquiries succeeded each other rapidly, as follows: \"'Is my handsome preacher married?'\n",

      "The writer--an Irish gentleman, named Dunboyne confided to me that his marriage had associated him with the murderess, who had then been recently executed, as brother-in-law to that infamous woman.\n",
      "While he had still a claim on their regard the family had always spoken of Eunice's unworthy lover by his Christian name; and what had been familiar in their mouths felt the influence of custom, before time enough had elapsed to make them think as readily of the enemy as they had hitherto thought of the friend.\n",

      "We could only wonder what had become of that mysterious married pair.\n",
      "Mr. Gracedieu being undoubtedly ignorant of the woman's marriage, it was not easy to say what the consequence might be, in his excitable state, if I informed him of it.\n",

      "If he is sufficiently infatuated to place his honor and his happiness at the mercy of a lady, who has behaved to her sister as your daughter has behaved to Miss Eunice, I warn the married couple not to expect a farthing of my money, either during my lifetime or after my death.\n",

      "So I amiably consented to forego my walk, yielding to the superior attraction of Mrs. Tenbruggen's company.\n",

      "It had been made only a few days before the testator's death; and the clause which left all his property to his son was preceded by expressions of paternal affection, at a time when Philip was in sore need of consolation.\n",
      "After alluding to a letter, received from his son, the old man added: \"I always loved him, without caring to confess it; I detest scenes of sentiment, kissings, embracings, tears, and that sort of thing.\n",
      "But Philip has yielded to my wishes, and has broken off a marriage which would have made him, as well as me, wretched for life.\n",
      "After this, I may speak my mind from my grave, and may tell my boy that I loved him.\n",
      "Is it really possible that Eunice refuses to marry him, after having saved his life?\"\n",
      "At breakfast, on the next day, the talk touched on those passages in Helena's diary, which had been produced in court as evidence against her.\n",
      "The gentle-hearted old maid was so touched by our meeting that she abandoned herself to the genial impulse of the moment, and gave Philip a kiss.\n",
      "\"If I consent to marry you,\" she said, \"I stain you with my disgrace; that shall never be.\"\n",
      "Married to a wife with a will of her own, and with true love to sustain her--a wife who would know when to take the command and how to take the command--a wife who, finding him tempted to commit actions unworthy of his better self, would be far-sighted enough to perceive that her husband's sense of honor might sometimes lose its balance, without being on that account hopelessly depraved--then, and, in these cases only, the probabilities would point to Philip as a man likely to be the better and the happier for his situation, when the bonds of wedlock had got him.\n",
      "Knowing what I alone knew, I could certainly remove Eunice's one objection to the marriage.\n",
      "Could I reconcile it to my conscience to permit a man, innocent of all knowledge of the truth, to marry the daughter of a condemned murderess, without honestly telling him what he was about to do?\n",
      "She ran to meet me as if she had been my daughter; she kissed me as if she had been my daughter; she fondly looked up at me as if she had been my daughter.\n",
      "The tone in which she put that question decided me--I was resolved to let her marry him.\n",
      "\"My dear, I am not putting you to any unfair trial,\" I assured her; \"I am going to prove that I love you as truly as if you were my own child.\"\n",
      "\"I can remove the only obstacle to your marriage, and I mean to do it.\n",
      "The marriage was deferred, at Eunice's request, as an expression of respect to the memory of Philip's father.\n",
      "Let Miss Jillgall describe the marriage, in her own inimitable way.\n",
      "A model marriage!\n",
      "She had written to Miss Jillgall, from Paris, to say that she had heard of old Mr. Dunboyne's death, and that she wished to have the letter returned, which she had left for delivery to Philip's father on the day when Philip and Eunice were married.\n",
      "\"Philip's marriage to Eunice (I shall go and congratulate them, of course), and the catastrophe (how dramatic!)\n",
      "I know, as well as you do, that Philip has married the adopted child.\n",
      "He has had a mother-in-law who was hanged, and, what is more, he has the honor, through his late father, of being otherwise connected with the murderess by marriage--as his aunt!\"\n",
      "No person could be better qualified to tell me who had married his wife's sister.\n",
      "\"My dear, I relieved your mind of those doubts on the morning of your marriage.\"\n",
      "If she was a good woman, you who love me would surely have made me happy by speaking of her?\"\n",

      "She did not fall in love, she did not wilfully flirt, she did not commit herself; but she smiled and whispered, and made confidences, and looked out of her own eyes into men's eyes as though there might be some mysterious bond between her and them--if only mysterious circumstances would permit it.\n",

      "To marry and have the command of money, to do her duty correctly, to live in a big house and be respected, had been her ambition,--and during the first fifteen years of her married life she was successful amidst great difficulties.\n",
      "If fidelity in a wife be compatible with such friendship, if the married state does not exact from a woman the necessity of debarring herself from all friendly intercourse with any man except her lord, Lady Carbury was not faithless.\n",

      "It was now five o'clock on a winter afternoon, the hour at which ladies are drinking tea, and idle men playing whist at the clubs,--at which young idle men are sometimes allowed to flirt, and at which, as Lady Carbury thought, her son might have been paying his court to Marie Melmotte the great heiress.\n",

      "It was known that Lord Alfred had not a shilling; but his brother was a duke and his sister was a duchess, and for the last thirty years there had been one continual anxiety for poor dear Alfred, who had tumbled into an unfortunate marriage without a shilling, had spent his own moderate patrimony, had three sons and three daughters, and had lived now for a very long time entirely on the unwilling contributions of his noble relatives.\n",

      "Paul hated Fisker horribly, did not love his uncle much, and would willingly have got back his £6,000 had he been able.\n",
      "He was intent on considering how he should bestow himself, consulting daily with Roger on the subject, when suddenly Roger had perceived that the young man was becoming attached to the girl whom he himself loved.\n",
      "She said that she was too young to think of marrying yet.\n",
      "But even that disparity was not now her strongest reason for feeling sure that she could not marry Roger Carbury.\n",
      "In the meantime the two men were fast friends,--so fast that Montague spent by far the greater part of his time as his friend's guest,--and all this was done with the understanding that Roger Carbury was to blaze up into hostile wrath should Paul ever receive the privilege to call himself Henrietta Carbury's favoured lover, but that everything was to be smooth between them should Henrietta be persuaded to become the mistress of Carbury Hall.\n",
      "The reader should also be informed that there had been already a former love affair in the young life of Paul Montague.\n",

      "\"She will do as she is told,--unless she can be made to be downright in love with some one like yourself.\n",
      "\"Of course if you will not take the trouble to be here to see her when she comes to your own house, you cannot expect her to think that you really love her.\"\n",
      "what a bother there is about loving!\n",
      "Lady Carbury had given him her hand with that energy of affection with which she was wont to welcome her literary friends, and had simply thrown one glance of appeal into his eyes as she looked into his face,--as though asking him how he had found it in his heart to be so cruel to one so tender, so unprotected, so innocent as herself.\n",
      "Of any feeling of another sort, of any turn at the moment towards flirtation, of any idea of encouragement to a gentleman who had once acted as though he were her lover, she was absolutely innocent.\n",
      "He could not quite make up his mind whether the lady was or was not in love with him,--or whether, if she were, it was incumbent on him to indulge her;--and if so, in what manner.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Mr. Broune knew of himself that he was not a marrying man.\n",
      "He had made up his mind that marriage would not suit his business, and he smiled to himself as he reflected how impossible it was that such a one as Lady Carbury should turn him from his resolution.\n",
      "She, poor girl, bewildered among various suitors, utterly confused by the life to which she was introduced, troubled by fitful attacks of admonition from her father, who would again, fitfully, leave her unnoticed for a week at a time; with no trust in her pseudo-mother--for poor Marie had in truth been born before her father had been a married man, and had never known what was her own mother's fate,--with no enjoyment in her present life, had come solely to this conclusion, that it would be well for her to be taken away somewhere by somebody.\n",
      "Then her father had married her present mother in Francfort.\n",
      "\"I love you better than anyone in the world,\" he said, speaking plainly enough for her to hear, perhaps indifferent as to the hearing of others.\n",
      "As a woman, understanding such things, who had herself been wooed, who had at least dreamed of love, she had greatly disapproved her son's manner.\n",
      "I hope he loves her.\"\n",
      "\"Why shouldn't he love her as well as any one else?\n",
      "You don't understand all that he might be with this girl's fortune, and what he must be unless he gets money by marriage.\n",
      "I love him.\n",
      "\"If he is to marry for that only, I cannot think that they will be happy.\"\n",
      "She, however, had not looked for happiness to love and loveliness, and need not therefore be disappointed on that score.\n",
      "She would not care how grey might be her hair, or how savage might be Mr. Alf, if her Felix were to marry this heiress.\n",
      "Lady Carbury recalled to mind her old conviction that a daughter may always succeed in beating a hard-hearted parent in a contention about marriage, if she be well in earnest.\n",
      "But then the girl must be really in earnest, and her earnestness will depend on that of her lover.\n",
      "Lady Carbury thought that her son wanted nothing but money to make him an acceptable suitor to such a father-in-law as Mr. Melmotte;--not money in the funds, not a real fortune, not so many thousands a-year that could be settled;--the man's own enormous wealth rendered this unnecessary;--but such a one as Mr. Melmotte would not like outward palpable signs of immediate poverty.\n",
      "Would not all hopes be over with Mr. Melmotte should he ever learn that his daughter's lover reached home and tumbled up-stairs to bed between eight and nine o'clock in the morning?\n",
      "\"It would be a fine thing if Adolphus would marry her,\" said Lady Pomona.\n",
      "\"Dolly will never marry anybody,\" said Georgiana.\n",
      "\"Why should Dolly marry such a creature as that?\"\n",
      "\"I think it is rather nice,\" said Dolly, submitting himself to be kissed.\n",
      "\"My dear boy,\" continued the mother, \"do you know that Miss Melmotte will have twenty--thousand--a year the day she marries; and that in all probability her husband will some day be the richest man in Europe?\"\n",
      "The girls, when they got up to go to bed, bent over him and kissed his head, as was their custom.\n",
      "There was very little show of affection in the kiss.\n",
      "It was very grievous to Henrietta that she should be taken to the house of a man who was in love with her, even though he was her cousin.\n",
      "Henrietta joins with me in kind love.\n",
      "Your affectionate cousin, MATILDA CARBURY.\n",
      "Much as he loved her, dear as her presence to him always was, he hardly wished to have her at Carbury unless she would come with a resolution to be its future mistress.\n",
      "Although there was more than one immediate cause for bitterness between them, Roger loved Paul Montague well and could not bear with patience the appearance of his friend's name on such a list.\n",
      "With the constancy, which was perhaps his strongest characteristic, he clung to his old affection for the man.\n",
      "He had asked his cousin to marry him,--having assured himself with certainty that he did love her better than any other woman,--and she had declined.\n",
      "She had refused him more than once, and he believed her implicitly when she told him that she could not love him.\n",
      "But if it were fated that he should not succeed with Henrietta, then,--so he felt assured,--no marriage would now be possible to him.\n",
      "The woman was affectionate, seeking good things for others rather than for herself; but she was essentially worldly, believing that good could come out of evil, that falsehood might in certain conditions be better than truth, that shams and pretences might do the work of true service, that a strong house might be built upon the sand!\n",
      "It was lamentable to him that the girl he loved should be subjected to this teaching, and live in an atmosphere so burdened with falsehood.\n",
      "In his heart of hearts he believed that she loved Paul Montague; and of Paul himself he was beginning to fear evil.\n",
      "What a life it would be for Henrietta Carbury were she to marry a man striving to become rich without labour and without capital, and who might one day be wealthy and the next a beggar,--a city adventurer, who of all men was to him the vilest and most dishonest?\n",
      "But I did so long to get into the country, and I do so love Carbury.\n",
      "said Roger, looking at Henrietta, who blushed with shame as she remembered that she had been brought into her lover's house solely in order that her brother might have an opportunity of seeing Marie Melmotte in the country.\n",
      "I take it they are very intimate.\"\n",
      "It was for no love of him that she was there.\n",
      "But now he saw that he and his house had been simply used in order that a vile project of marrying two vile people to each other might be furthered!\n",
      "The only chance for a young man in his position is that he should marry a girl with money.\n",
      "\"And therefore is it not imperative that he should marry a girl with money?\"\n",
      "It stands to reason that the girl will not marry Felix unless she loves him.\"\n",
      "\"But does he love her?\"\n",
      "Is a girl to be debarred from being loved because she has money?\n",
      "Of course she looks to be married, and why should she not have Felix if she likes him best?\n",
      "\"You will never get me to say that I think the family will be benefited by a marriage with the daughter of Mr. Melmotte.\n",
      "When there is a question of marriage people at any rate should know something of each other.\n",
      "\"He would give her her fortune when she married.\"\n",
      "\"Do you mean that Felix should not marry the girl, even if they love each other?\"\n",
      "He shook his head in disgust, feeling sure that any idea of love on the part of the young man was a sham and a pretence, not only as regarded him, but also his mother.\n",
      "Was it thus that he was to part with the one human being in the world that he loved?\n",
      "But if there were one among all others to whom the house should be a house of refuge from care, not an abode of trouble, on whose behalf were it possible he would make the very air softer, and the flowers sweeter than their wont, to whom he would declare, were such words possible to his tongue, that of him and of his house, and of all things there she was the mistress, whether she would condescend to love him or no,--that one was his cousin Hetta.\n",
      "She fully appreciated the truth, and honour, and honesty of his character, and could have loved him so dearly as her cousin if he would have contented himself with such cousinly love!\n",
      "But how could she be guided by a lover whom she did not love?\n",
      "You know I did not mean that he was too old to get married.\n",
      "Men a great deal older get married every day.\"\n",
      "\"If you don't accept him he will never marry.\n",
      "Her mother had spoken of him as of one who might be regarded as all but dead and buried, simply because of his love for her.\n",
      "Could it be true that his constancy was such that he would never marry unless she would take his hand?\n",
      "She came to think of him with more tenderness than she had ever felt before, but, yet, she would not tell herself she loved him.\n",
      "It might, perhaps, be her duty to give herself to him without loving him,--because he was so good; but she was sure that she did not love him.\n",
      "He was an unselfish man, who loved his neighbour as himself, and forgave all trespasses, and thanked God for his daily bread from his heart, and prayed heartily to be delivered from temptation.\n",
      "Perhaps there was no bishop in England more loved or more useful in his diocese than the Bishop of Elmham.\n",
      "But he loved his father, and was endless in prayer, wearying his saints with supplications, that his father might see the truth and be as he was.\n",
      "To the mother her son was Sir Felix, the baronet, entitled to special consideration because of his position and rank,--because also of his intention to marry the great heiress of the day.\n"

      "Why should she with all her prettiness, and all her cleverness,--with all her fortune to boot,--marry that dustiest of all men, John Crumb, before she had seen something of the beauties of the things of which she had read in the books which came in her way?\n",
      "But, alas, she thought there might be something better than such worship; and, therefore, when Felix Carbury came in her way, with his beautiful oval face, and his rich brown colour, and his bright hair and lovely moustache, she was lost in a feeling which she mistook for love; and when he sneaked over to her a second and a third time, she thought more of his listless praise than ever she had thought of John Crumb's honest promises.\n",

      "She knew well that she loved the other man.\n",
      "That other man had never asked her for her love, but she thought that she knew that he desired it.\n",

      "Lady Carbury had come to his house simply that it might be useful to her; Sir Felix did not pretend to treat him with even ordinary courtesy; and Hetta herself, though she was soft to him and gracious, was soft and gracious through pity rather than love.\n",
      "And yet, when he told her of the greatness of his love, and of its endurance, she was simply silent.\n",
      "In speaking of him to Hetta he had alluded only to the affection which had existed between them.\n",
      "But he felt that because of those services his friend Montague had owed it to him not to fall in love with the girl he loved; and he thought that if, unfortunately, this had happened unawares, Montague should have retired as soon as he learned the truth.\n",
      "He could not bring himself to forgive his friend, even though Hetta had assured him that his friend had never spoken to her of love.\n",

      "Felix was not at all anxious to talk about his love, and changed the subject very willingly.\n",
      "But if he were to run away with her and marry her, and then find that she were not forgiven, and that Melmotte allowed her to starve without a shilling of fortune, where would he be then?\n",

      "This little meeting occurred on the day after Felix Carbury's return from Suffolk, and at a time at which, as we know, it was the great duty of his life to get the consent of old Melmotte to his marriage with Marie Melmotte.\n",
      "That talking about the Bible, and the forgiving of trespasses, was very queer; and that allusion to the marrying of heiresses very queer indeed.\n",

      "\"Perhaps that will be best,\" said the lover.\n",
      "No doubt he might marry Marie Melmotte.\n",
      "She was in love with him, which was natural; and was a fool,--which was perhaps also natural.\n",

      "\"But she loves you?\"\n",
      "\"You have told her of your love?\"\n",
      "Will any woman love you as I do;--live for you as I do?\n",
      "I have told the woman here that I am engaged to marry you.\"\n",
      "Remember all our love,--and be good to me.\"\n",
      "I need only refer you to our journey from San Francisco to London to make you conscious that I really love you.\n",
      "To a woman such love is all important.\n",
      "You say that there is some one you love better than you love me, but that you have not committed yourself to her.\n",
      "A man cannot wrap himself up and keep himself warm with an absent love as a woman does.\n",
      "I think that you must have owned to yourself that you did love me, and that you could love me again.\n",
      "I think you are too good a man to cast aside a woman you have loved,--like a soiled glove,--because ill-natured words have been spoken of her by men, or perhaps by women, who know nothing of her life.\n",
      "My late husband, Caradoc Hurtle, was Attorney-General in the State of Kansas when I married him, I being then in possession of a considerable fortune left to me by my mother.\n",
      "She had spoken of her lover's entanglement with that other lady as a light thing which might easily be put aside.\n",
      "And then, in her reference to money, not descending to the details of dollars and cents, she had studied how to make him feel that he might marry her without imprudence.\n",
      "He should marry her,--or there should be something done which should make the name of Winifrid Hurtle known to the world!\n",
      "Could it be possible that she, with all her intellectual gifts as well as those of her outward person, should be thrown over by a man whom well as she loved him,--and she did love him with all her heart,--she regarded as greatly inferior to herself!\n",
      "He had promised to marry her; and he should marry her, or the world should hear the story of his perjury!\n",
      "He had loved her and had promised to make her his wife,--and had determined to break his word to her because he found that she was enveloped in dangerous mystery.\n",
      "He had so resolved before he had ever seen Hetta Carbury, having been made to believe by Roger Carbury that a marriage with an unknown American woman,--of whom he only did know that she was handsome and clever,--would be a step to ruin.\n",
      "It would be for his friend's interest that he should marry the widow.\n",
      "He could not say all that he would have to say without speaking of Hetta;--and of his love for Hetta he could not speak to his rival.\n",
      "He thought for a moment that he would write a stern and true letter to the woman, telling her that as it was impossible that there should ever be marriage between them, he felt himself bound to abstain from her society.\n",
      "The woman of the house with a smile showed him into Mrs. Hurtle's sitting-room, and he at once perceived that the smile was intended to welcome him as an accepted lover.\n",
      "It was a smile half of congratulation to the lover, half of congratulation to herself as a woman that another man had been caught by the leg and made fast.\n",
      "Paul did not hear the word, but was sure that it bore some indistinct reference to his expected marriage.\n",
      "There are a thousand little silly softnesses which are pretty and endearing between acknowledged lovers, with which no woman would like to dispense, to which even men who are in love submit sometimes with delight; but which in other circumstances would be vulgar,--and to the woman distasteful.\n",
      "At this time he was thoroughly in love with Hetta Carbury, and was not in love with Mrs. Hurtle.\n",
      "I wonder whether any girl ever did sit and cry like that because her lover talked to another woman.\n",
      "Then she threw herself into his arms, not kissing him but looking up into his face.\n",
      "Oh Paul, my love!\n",
      "There is nothing I cannot do for love of you,--but to lose you.\"\n",
      "He nodded assent, then took her in his arms and kissed her, and left her without a word.\n",
      "\"There never was any love between you two, I know.\n",
      "I don't like Lord Nidderdale, and I will never take any one but the man I love.\n",
      "Sir Felix was quite willing to marry the girl to-morrow,--on condition of course that the money was properly arranged; but he was not willing to go through much work in the way of love-making with Marie Melmotte.\n",
      "It's done every day, and nobody thinks any harm of it when you marry the girl.\n",
      "Her own father had almost alluded to such a proceeding,--had certainly hinted that it was feasible,--but at the same time had very clearly stated that in such case the ardent lover would have to content himself with the lady alone.\n",
      "\"Of course you would marry her at once.\"\n",
      "If you take her off in a spirited sort of way and then marry her, everybody will be with you.\n",
      "\"Then he shall,\" said Marie, clinging to her lover.\n",
      "\"I will never marry Lord Nidderdale.\n",
      "Felix, you love me;--do you not?\"\n",
      "Oh, Felix, tell her that you love me.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, love!\n",
      "I will walk down among them into papa's room, and say that I will never marry that man, and that this is my lover.\n",
      "\"I told papa to-day that I wouldn't marry Lord Nidderdale.\"\n",
      "I will not be ashamed to tell everybody that I love you.\"\n",
      "The two lovers were alone for one moment, during which Marie lifted up her face, and Sir Felix kissed her lips.\n",
      "\"Sir Felix, it is well that I should tell you that my daughter is engaged to marry Lord Nidderdale.\"\n",
      "\"Sir Felix, I am not engaged--to--marry Lord Nidderdale,\" said Marie.\n",
      "\"She will marry Lord Nidderdale,\" continued Mr. Melmotte, addressing himself to Sir Felix.\n",
      "\"Papa, he is my lover,\" said Marie.\n",
      "If you loved me, papa, you would not want to make me unhappy all my life.\"\n",
      "Her father walked up to her rapidly with his hand raised, and she clung only the closer to her lover's arm.\n",
      "It is not more disgraceful to love him than that other man.\n",
      "You can't both marry her.\n",
      "I'm not the man to give my daughter a single shilling if she marries against my consent.\n",
      "He says he won't give me anything if I marry without his leave.\n",
      "It was evident that she did not care to what extent she braved her father on behalf of her lover, and now she coolly proposed to rob him.\n",
      "Her proposition, put into plain English, amounted to this: \"Take me and marry me without my father's consent,--and then you and I together can rob my father of the money which, for his own purposes, he has settled upon me.\"\n",
      "She had offered to be beaten, and killed, and chopped to pieces on behalf of her lover.\n",
      "He had been set to marry this heiress, having at first no great liking for the attempt, because of its difficulties and the small amount of hope which it offered him.\n",
      "He was the beloved and the accepted suitor of Marie Melmotte.\n",
      "\"I am an enthusiastic lover of beneficent audacity,\" said Lady Carbury, picking her words slowly, and showing herself to be quite satisfied with herself as she picked them.\n",
      "\"I won't give her a shilling if she marries any one else; that's all.\n",
      "Here at any rate was an undertaking on the part of the great man that he would be the \"making of Felix,\" if Felix would only obey him--accompanied, or rather preceded, by a most positive assurance that if Felix were to succeed in marrying his daughter he would not give his son-in-law a shilling!\n",
      "There was an appreciation of real tragedy in her heart while she contemplated the position of Sir Felix married to such a girl as she supposed Marie Melmotte to be, without any means of support for either of them but what she could supply.\n",
      "Though the ambition was vilely ignoble, the mother's love was noble and disinterested.\n",
      "That he should threaten to disinherit his daughter if she married contrary to his wishes was to be expected.\n",
      "But would it not be equally a matter of course that he should make the best of the marriage if it were once effected?\n",
      "\"He is engaged to marry that man's daughter.\"\n",
      "\"Engaged to marry Miss Melmotte?\"\n",
      "I thought she was to marry Lord Nidderdale.\"\n",
      "She is desperately in love with him,--as is he with her.\"\n",
      "\"Melmotte naturally wants her to marry the lord.\n",
      "He came here to tell me that if his daughter married Felix she should not have a penny.\"\n",
      "And in these days young people are not often kept from marrying simply by a father's fantasy.\n",
      "\"You think he should marry the girl then in spite of the father?\"\n",
      "It was evidently intended to imply that he at least had reached a time of life at which any allusion to love would be absurd.\n",
      "Mr. Broune, thinking of himself and his own circumstances, could see no reason why he should not be in love.\n",
      "\"I was going on to say that I hoped we were not too old to--love.\"\n",
      "This was worse even than the kiss, as being more troublesome and less easily pushed on one side and forgotten.\n",
      "It may serve to explain the condition of Lady Carbury's mind at the time if it be stated that she did not even at this moment suppose that the editor of the \"Morning Breakfast Table\" intended to make her an offer of marriage.\n",
      "She knew, or thought she knew, that middle-aged men are fond of prating about love, and getting up sensational scenes.\n",
      "Had she known that the editor professed to be in love with some lady in the next street, she would have been quite ready to enlist the lady in the next street among her friends that she might thus strengthen her own influence with Mr. Broune.\n",
      "But that any man, placed as Mr. Broune was in the world,--blessed with power, with a large income, with influence throughout all the world around him, courted, fêted, feared and almost worshipped,--that he should desire to share her fortunes, her misfortunes, her struggles, her poverty and her obscurity, was not within the scope of her imagination.\n",
      "She did not dream of loving him.\n",
      "She felt sure that she never could love him.\n",
      "Had it been on the cards with her to love any man as a lover, it would have been some handsome spendthrift who would have hung from her neck like a nether millstone.\n",
      "It did not occur to her that she could love him; but it did occur to her that he might lift her out of her difficulties.\n",
      "Perhaps the truest aspiration of her heart had been the love of freedom which the tyranny of her late husband had engendered.\n",
      "\"Lady Carbury,\" he said, \"I have lived a long time without marrying, and I have sometimes thought that it would be better for me to go on in the same way to the end.\n",
      "I have worked so hard all my life that when I was young I had no time to think of love.\n",
      "And so it has been with me till I fancied, not that I was too old for love, but that others would think me so.\n",
      "And I have come to love you.\n",
      "And he must have surely been much blinded by love, before convincing himself that he could trust his happiness to such keeping.\n",
      "\"Your daughter I can love as my own.\n",
      "\"Mr. Broune, I love him better,--always shall love him better,--than anything in the world.\"\n",
      "This was calculated to damp the lover's ardour, but he probably reflected that should he now be successful, time might probably change the feeling which had just been expressed.\n",
      "He took her hand in his, and kissing it, left her without another word.\n",
      "That last apparition which he had encountered at his lady love's door certainly had not tended to reassure him.\n",
      "It could not be for the good of this man that he should marry her,--and she did in the midst of her many troubles try to think of the man's condition.\n",
      "And whithersoever he might go, to what lowest canine regions he might descend, she knew herself well enough to be sure that whether married or single she would go with him.\n",
      "But her love for her son mastered her,--and she knew it.\n",
      "As it was so, could it be fit that she should marry another man?\n",
      "A repetition of marriage vows did not of itself recommend itself to her.\n",
      "As to loving the man, liking his caresses, and being specially happy because he was near her,--no romance of that kind ever presented itself to her imagination.\n",
      "Why did not Hetta marry her cousin Roger Carbury and let there be an end of that trouble?\n",
      "Of course Hetta must live wherever her mother lived till she should marry; but Hetta's life was so much at her own disposal that her mother did not feel herself bound to be guided in the great matter by Hetta's predispositions.\n",
      "But she must tell Hetta should she ultimately make up her mind to marry the man, and in that case the sooner this was done the better.\n",
      "Ever and again as she declared to herself that she would not marry him, the picture of a comfortable assured home over her head, and the conviction that the editor of the \"Morning Breakfast Table\" would be powerful for all things, brought new doubts to her mind.\n",
      "She had been really intimate with Julia Triplex, and had been sympathetic when a brilliant marriage had been achieved.\n",
      "She dispensed champagne and smiles, and made everybody, including herself, believe that she was in love with her husband.\n",
      "The great Monogram marriage had been accomplished very suddenly, and had taken place,--exalting Julia very high,--just as Georgiana was beginning to allow her aspirations to descend.\n",
      "The two ladies kissed each other when they met--of course, and then Miss Longestaffe at once began.\n"

      "Nothing perhaps is so efficacious in preventing men from marrying as the tone in which married women speak of the struggles made in that direction by their unmarried friends.\n",
      "An early hour had been named; but hours may be mistaken, and Ruby had thought that a fine gentleman, such as was her lover, used to live among fine people up in London, might well mistake the afternoon for the morning.\n",
      "After that for three weeks she heard nothing of her London lover, but she was always thinking of him;--and though she could not altogether avoid her country lover, she was in his company as little as possible.\n",
      "One afternoon her grandfather returned from Bungay and told her that her country lover was coming to see her.\n",
      "John Crumb is to marry you next month, and the banns is to be said.\"\n",
      "But no parson among 'em all can marry me without I'm willing.\"\n",
      "And she remembered the heavy, flat, broad honest face of the meal-man, with his mouth slow in motion, and his broad nose looking like a huge white promontory, and his great staring eyes, from the corners of which he was always extracting meal and grit;--and then also she remembered the white teeth, the beautiful soft lips, the perfect eyebrows, and the rich complexion of her London lover.\n",
      "\"It's no good going against love,\" she said to herself, \"and I won't try.\n",
      "He was accompanied by his friend Joe Mixet, the baker of Bungay, who, as all Bungay knew, was to be his best man at his marriage.\n",
      "Joe Mixet was probably right; but there had been a want of prudence, a lack of worldly sagacity, in the way in which Crumb had allowed his proposed marriage with Ruby Ruggles to become a source of gossip to all Bungay.\n",
      "His love was now an old affair; and, though he never talked much, whenever he did talk, he talked about that.\n",
      "He was proud of Ruby's beauty, and of her fortune, and of his own status as her acknowledged lover,--and he did not hide his light under a bushel.\n",
      "The lover had seated himself without speaking a word; but now he was instigated to ask a question.\n",
      "She had enveloped herself in a big household apron when the cooking was in hand, and had not cared to take it off for the greeting of this lover.\n",
      "\"I loiks to see her loik o' that,\" said John rubbing his hands down the back of his trowsers, and stooping till he had brought his eyes down to a level with those of his sweetheart.\n",
      "\"You've got it all afore you,\" said the farmer,--leaving the lover to draw what lesson he might from this oracular proposition.\n",
      "He turned round and gave her a look of love that might have softened the heart of an Amazon; but instead of speaking he held up his tumbler, and bobbed his head at the beer jug.\n",
      "Then she filled it to the brim, frothing it in the manner in which he loved to have it frothed.\n",
      "He had been her lover, and she would be as kind to him as she knew how,--short of love.\n",
      "\"I'll just take a drop of y'ell,\" said John Crumb, apparently quite unmoved by the absence of his sweetheart.\n",
      "\"Nohow's,\" said the lover, shaking his head and still standing upright with his hands by his side.\n",
      "It's true love as has brought John Crumb to Sheep's Acre farm this night;--love of that young lady, if she'll let me make so free.\n",
      "He's a proposed to her, and she's a haccepted him, and now it's about time as they was married.\n",
      "As soon as Mixet was gone John looked at his sweetheart out of the corners of his eyes and made a slow motion towards her, putting out his right hand as a feeler.\n",
      "While her lover held her grandfather Ruby escaped, and seated herself on the bedside, again afraid to undress, lest she should be disturbed by her grandfather.\n",
      "But by degrees there came upon him a feeling half of compassion and half of fear, with perhaps some mixture of love, instigating him to make search for her.\n",
      "There had been words between him and his granddaughter about her lover.\n",
      "Her lover had been accepted and had come to the farm to claim his bride.\n",
      "It had been made quite clear to him that the old man had quarrelled with his granddaughter and had threatened to turn her out of his house, not because she had misbehaved with Sir Felix, but on account of her refusing to marry John Crumb.\n",
      "John Crumb was thirsting for blood and was not very capable in his present mood of arguing the matter out coolly, and Roger, little as he loved his cousin, was not desirous that all Suffolk should know that Sir Felix Carbury had been thrashed within an inch of his life by John Crumb of Bungay.\n",
      "So the matter was settled, and the grandfather and lover returned together to Bungay.\n",
      "He had promised his daughter to Lord Nidderdale, and as he rose in the world had lowered the price which he offered for this marriage,--not so much in the absolute amount of fortune to be ultimately given, as in the manner of giving it.\n",
      "Fifteen thousand a year was to be settled on Marie and on her eldest son, and twenty thousand pounds were to be paid into Nidderdale's hands six months after the marriage.\n",
      "He intended that she should marry Lord Nidderdale, and himself fixed some day in August for the wedding.\n",
      "Marie however was not so wedded to the grandeur which she encountered in Grosvenor Square as to be afraid of the starvation which she thought she might have to suffer if married to Sir Felix Carbury.\n",
      "He's looking only for what you haven't got, and shan't have if you marry him.\n",
      "He was not very skilful at making love,--but he was thoroughly good-humoured, from his nature anxious to please, and averse to give pain.\n",
      "You know well enough that you and I can't marry without leave from the governors.\"\n",
      "But I don't think any governor has a right to make anybody marry any one.\"\n",
      "\"And no governor shall make me marry.\n",
      "\"But I don't know why you shouldn't--just marry me--because you--like me.\"\n",
      "\"I like you ever so,--only marrying a person is different.\"\n",
      "\"I tell you, my lord, I'm--in love.\"\n",
      "And so Nidderdale took his dismissal, and went away,--not however without an idea that the marriage would still come off.\n",
      "She had encountered the troubles of one marriage, and they had been very bad.\n",
      "She did not look upon that marriage as a mistake,--having even up to this day a consciousness that it had been the business of her life, as a portionless girl, to obtain maintenance and position at the expense of suffering and servility.\n",
      "Having considered these things deeply, she wrote as follows to Mr. Broune:-- DEAREST FRIEND, I need not tell you that I have thought much of your generous and affectionate offer.\n",
      "But I shall never marry again.\n",
      "Nevertheless, I am your most affectionate friend, MATILDA CARBURY.\n",
      "When she would sit with her paper before her, preparing her future work for the press, copying a bit here and a bit there, inventing historical details, dovetailing her chronicle, her head would sometimes seem to be going round as she remembered the unpaid baker, and her son's horses, and his unmeaning dissipation, and all her doubts about the marriage.\n",
      "That gently sarcastic appellation by which Lady Carbury had described him to herself when he had kissed her best explained that side of Mr. Broune's character which showed itself in this matter.\n",
      "Had she allowed him to kiss her without objection, the kissing might probably have gone on; and, whatever might have come of it, there would have been no offer of marriage.\n",
      "He had believed that her little manoeuvres had indicated love on her part, and he had felt himself constrained to reciprocate the passion.\n",
      "She had repudiated the kiss, and therefore he had felt himself bound to obtain for himself the right to kiss her.\n",
      "Then, after all, the woman wasn't in love with him!\n",
      "The woman had shown her love by a thousand signs.\n",
      "Mr. Broune would not like to have it known about among brother editors, or by the world at large, that he had offered to marry Lady Carbury and that Lady Carbury had refused him.\n",
      "Paul Montague finding himself without support and alone, slowly made his way out into the court.\n",
      "She is going to marry Lord Nidderdale.\n",
      "Sir Felix had not the courage to say that he expected to get the girl he loved.\n",
      "I'll put you in the way of doing so well with these shares that you shall be able to marry any other girl you please;--or to live without marrying, which you'll find to be better.\"\n",
      "On my word of honour as a gentleman, if my daughter were to marry you, she'd never have a single shilling.\n",
      "Melmotte himself dictated the words, which were not romantic in their nature.\n",
      "DEAR SIR, In consideration of the offers made by you to me, and on a clear understanding that such a marriage would be disagreeable to you and to the lady's mother, and would bring down a father's curse upon your daughter, I hereby declare and promise that I will not renew my suit to the young lady, which I hereby altogether renounce.\n",
      "Did he mean to deny that he had promised to marry her?\n",
      "At that moment he had felt that any fate in life would be better than a marriage on compulsion.\n",
      "He had loved her and had won her love.\n",
      "She would look up in his face and he could not but embrace her.\n",
      "When she told him of her wrongs and of her love; of his promise and his former devotion to her; when she assured him that she had given up everything in life for him, and threw her arms round him, looking into his eyes;--then he would almost yield.\n",
      "He must tell her to her face that he was not satisfied with her past life, and that therefore he would not marry her.\n",
      "It was his misfortune,--and also his fault,--that he had submitted to be loved by a wild cat.\n",
      "I could not marry a woman who had fought a duel,--certainly not a woman who had fought with her own husband.\n",
      "It may well be that the gentleman deserved to be shot; but there is something in the deed so repulsive to me,--no doubt irrationally,--that, on that score also, I must decline to marry you.\n",
      "It occurred to him that he would \"be coming a cropper rather,\" were he to marry Melmotte's daughter for her money, and then find that she had got none.\n",
      "\"She is to marry Lord Nidderdale, I think.\"\n",
      "They are talking of her marrying Felix, and of course it is for her money.\n",

      "I believe he does love his neighbour as himself.\"\n",
      "\"I love him better than any man,--as well as a man can love a man.\n",
      "If you will say that you love him as well as a woman can love a man,--I will leave England at once, and never return to it.\"\n",
      "\"Tell me this, Hetta; are you engaged to marry him?\"\n",
      "\"Has he asked you to marry him?\"\n",
      "I do love him.\n",
      "I do love him, and I shall never love any one else.\"\n",
      "\"If so,\" said she, \"Mr. Melmotte will be a ruined man too, and yet you want Felix to marry Marie Melmotte.\"\n",
      "And you think you will marry this man because he is to make a fortune out of the Railway!\"\n",
      "I have not thought of marrying him, mamma.\n",
      "\"Why will you not marry your cousin?\"\n",
      "He is so much above me, that, though I do love him, I cannot think of him in that way.\n",
      "And I have told you that I do love some one else.\n",
      "Good night, mamma,\" she said, coming up to her mother and kissing her.\n",

      "During all these days Miss Melmotte was by no means contented with her lover's prowess, though she would not allow herself to doubt his sincerity.\n",
      "She had not only assured him of her undying affection in the presence of her father and mother, had not only offered to be chopped in pieces on his behalf, but had also written to him, telling how she had a large sum of her father's money within her power, and how willing she was to make it her own, to throw over her father and mother, and give herself and her fortune to her lover.\n",
      "She felt that she had been very gracious to her lover, and that her lover was a little slow in acknowledging the favours conferred upon him.\n",
      "But, nevertheless, she was true to her lover, and believed that he was true to her.\n",
      "But now she was told that a day was absolutely fixed for her marriage with Lord Nidderdale, and that her things were to be got ready.\n",
      "She was to be married in the middle of August, and here they were, approaching the end of June.\n",
      "\"I know what I'm about now, and I won't marry anybody just because it will suit papa.\"\n",

      "There would be no \"cropper\" which a man could \"come\" so bad as would be his cropper were he to marry Marie Melmotte, and then find that he was not to have a shilling!\n",
      "\"But you do love me?\"\n",
      "If I didn't love you why should I be here walking round this stupid place?\n",
      "They talk of your being married to Nidderdale about the end of August.\"\n",
      "They can't take me up and marry me, as they used to do the girls ever so long ago.\n",

      "But--\" \"Very well then;--if that's your love,\" said Marie, turning back from him.\n",
      "\"There's some lover, isn't there;--some would-be husband whom she does not like?\"\n",
      "The girl is content with the love without having the love justified, because the object is more desirable.\n",
      "She can only have her love justified with an object less desirable.\n",
      "We like our philosophers; we like our poets; we like our genuine workmen;--but we love our heroes.\n",
      "But one would have said that there was only love in her eyes;--love which might be disappointed, but still love.\n",
      "Oh, Paul, if it was your purpose to tell me of your love, to assure me that you are still my dear, dear friend, to speak with hope of future days, or with pleasure of those that are past,--then carry out your purpose.\n",
      "Then, as he took his leave, she stood close against him, and put her cheek up for him to kiss.\n",
      "Of course he took her in his arms, and kissed her lips as well as her cheeks.\n",
      "Ruby's father had married a Pipkin whose brother had died leaving a widow behind him at Islington.\n",
      "The old man at Sheep's Acre farm had greatly resented this marriage, had never spoken to his daughter-in-law,--or to his son after the marriage, and had steeled himself against the whole Pipkin race.\n",
      "Mrs. Pipkin immediately asked after a lover.\n",
      "If the lover was what he ought to be, had he not better come and see her?\n",
      "Then she told all the story of John Crumb:--how she hated John Crumb; how resolved she was that nothing should make her marry John Crumb.\n",
      "\"What's all the love in the world, Ruby, if a man can't do for you?\"\n",
      "If Ruby chose to manage in her own way about her lover she must.\n",
      "And therefore when Ruby went to the theatre once and again,--by herself as far as Mrs. Pipkin knew, but probably in company with her lover,--and did not get home till past midnight, Mrs. Pipkin said very little about it, attributing such novel circumstances to the altered condition of her country.\n",
      "Ruby had never yet told the name of her lover to Mrs. Pipkin, having answered all inquiries by saying that she was all right.\n",
      "said Ruby one evening to her lover.\n",
      "But yet as she sat sipping her lover's brandy and water between eleven and twelve at the music-hall in the City Road, she was not altogether comfortable.\n",
      "And her lover, though he was beautiful,--oh, so beautiful!--was not all that a lover should be.\n",
      "Her mind was set upon--marriage, but the word had hardly passed between them.\n",
      "She was glad therefore to take the first opportunity of telling her lover that something was going to happen.\n",
      "\"Is Montague going to marry her?\"\n",
      "When gentlemen are fixed as they're to be married, they never are regular afterwards.\n",
      "It was heaven to her to be spinning round the big room with her lover's arm tight round her waist, with one hand in his and her other hanging over his back.\n",
      "She loved the music, and loved the motion.\n",
      "She went and danced, resolving as she did so that she would have some answer to her question before she left her lover on that night.\n",
      "And you told me you loved me;--didn't you?\n",
      "I want you to say whether you mean to marry me.\n",
      "No, I don't ever mean to marry.\n",
      "She could imagine that a man should wish to put it off, but that he should have the face to declare to his young woman that he never meant to marry at all, was a thing that she could not understand.\n",
      "I'm to be carrying on with you, and nothing to come of it; but for you to tell me that you don't mean to marry, never at all!\n",
      "\"If he did he'd marry her out of hand,--because he's a gentleman.\n",
      "But for a young man to come after a young woman, and then say, right out, as he never means to marry at all, is the lowest-spirited fellow that ever was.\n",
      "He would not even make a lover's easy promise, in order that the present hour might be made pleasant.\n",
      "Though in her rage she had been able on the previous evening to dismiss her titled lover, and to imply that she never meant to see him again, now, when the remembrance of the loss came upon her amidst her daily work,--when she could no longer console herself in her drudgery by thinking of the beautiful things that were in store for her, and by flattering herself that though at this moment she was little better than a maid of all work in a lodging-house, the time was soon coming in which she would bloom forth as a baronet's bride,--now in her solitude she almost regretted the precipitancy of her own conduct.\n",
      "But yet,--that he should have said never;--that he would never marry!\n",
      "But Roger had already heard a few words from Mrs. Pipkin as to Ruby's late hours, had heard also that there was a lover, and knew very well who that lover was.\n",
      "John Crumb was a gallant, loving fellow who might be induced to forgive everything, if Ruby would only go back to him; but would certainly persevere, after some slow fashion of his own, and \"see the matter out,\" as he would say himself, if she did not go back.\n",
      "Nobody can make you marry Mr. Crumb, unless you please.\"\n",
      "\"But I fear you have given him up for somebody else, who certainly won't marry you, and who can only mean to ruin you.\"\n",
      "He has no more idea of marrying you than I have; but were he to marry you, he could not support you.\n",
      "He loves you.\n",
      "He loves you after that fashion that he wants to make you happy and respectable, not to make you a bye-word and a disgrace.\"\n",
      "If you were once married to John Crumb, would any one then pull you by the hairs of your head?\n",
      "You don't know what a man's love really means, Ruby.\n",
      "You know it as well as I do myself;--and you're throwing yourself away, and throwing the man who loves you over,--for such a fellow as that!\n",
      "There were people who said that this support was given by Mr. Broune under the influence of Lady Carbury, and that Lady Carbury in this way endeavoured to reconcile the great man to a marriage between his daughter and Sir Felix.\n",
      "In praising a book, or putting foremost the merits of some official or military claimant, or writing up a charity,--in some small matter of merely personal interest,--the Editor of the \"Morning Breakfast Table\" might perhaps allow himself to listen to a lady whom he loved.\n",
      "No proprietor or editor was ever brought before the courts at the cost of ever so many hundred pounds,--which if things go badly may rise to thousands,--because he had attributed all but divinity to some very poor specimen of mortality.\n",
      "She entertained a mysterious awe for Mr. Alf,--much in excess of any similar feeling excited by Mr. Broune, in regard to whom her awe had been much diminished since he had made her an offer of marriage.\n",
      "I'm told that I'm to congratulate you on your coming marriage.\"\n",
      "But, Lord love 'ee, she shall come and be missus of my house to-morrow, and what 'll it matter her then what they say?\n",
      "He don't come out straight forrard, and tell a girl as he loves her afore all the parish.\n",
      "Hitherto he had shuffled off every question that had been asked him about Felix, though he knew that Ruby had spent many hours with her fashionable lover.\n",
      "Mrs. Hurtle, too, as she leaned with friendly weight upon his arm, indulged also in moonshine and romance.\n",
      "Do you mean to marry her?\"\n",
      "Does she think that you intend to marry her?\"\n",
      "He was going on to declare that he had told her that he loved another woman, but he felt that he could hardly touch that matter in speaking to Roger Carbury.\n",
      "You have allowed yourself to be entrapped into a promise of marriage; and then, for reasons which we will not go into now but which we both thought to be adequate, you resolved to break your promise, thinking that you would be justified in doing so.\n",
      "You come down here to this hotel, where we are both known, with this lady whom you are not going to marry;--and I meet you, just by chance.\n",
      "Of course I think that the lady will succeed in marrying you.\"\n",
      "\"And that such a marriage will be your destruction.\n",
      "\"Then if I marry at all,\" said Roger, with all his prejudice expressed strongly in his voice, \"I trust I may not marry a lady of her country.\n",
      "She does not think that she is to marry you, and yet she comes down here and stays with you.\n",
      "She is here with you in order that she may marry you.\n",
      "Believing as I do that marriage with her would be destruction, I should tell her my mind,--and leave her.\"\n",
      "And yet he feared, he almost knew, that this man,--who had promised to marry a strange American woman and who was at this very moment living in close intercourse with the woman after he had told her that he would not keep his promise,--was the chief barrier between himself and the girl that he loved.\n",
      "But Hetta Carbury, if once her heart had passed from her own dominion into the possession of another, would never change her love.\n",
      "Roger thought that he knew that at any rate she had not as yet declared her love.\n",
      "If she were now to know,--if she could now learn,--of what nature was the love of this other man; if she could be instructed that he was living alone with a lady whom not long since he had promised to marry,--if she could be made to understand this whole story of Mrs. Hurtle, would not that open her eyes?\n"

      "A week since it had been understood that admission for the evening could not be had for love or money, and that a seat at the dinner-table was as a seat at some banquet of the gods!\n",
      "His Majesty the Emperor has been pleased to intimate that he has been much gratified.\"\n",
      "And I'm rather afraid that before he was married he used to box with all the prize-fighters, and to be a little too free behind the scenes.\n",
      "Although she had acknowledged the fact to Lady Monogram in her desire to pave the way for the reception of herself into society as a married woman, she had not as yet found courage to tell her family.\n",
      "So was Goldsheiner a Jew, whom Lady Julia Start had married,--or at any rate had been one a very short time before he ran away with that lady.\n",
      "She counted up ever so many instances on her fingers of \"decent people\" who had married Jews or Jewesses.\n",
      "Lord Frederic Framlinghame had married a girl of the Berrenhoffers; and Mr. Hart had married a Miss Chute.\n",
      "How could she tell parents such as these that she was engaged to marry a man who at the present moment went to synagogue on a Saturday and carried out every other filthy abomination common to the despised people?\n",
      "She had plucked up so much courage as had enabled her to declare her fate to her old friend,--remembering as she did so how in days long past she and her friend Julia Triplex had scattered their scorn upon some poor girl who had married a man with a Jewish name,--whose grandfather had possibly been a Jew.\n",
      "Sir Damask's religion had never been doubted, though except on the occasion of his marriage no acquaintance of his had probably ever seen him in church.\n",
      "On the morning before she left the Melmottes in Bruton Street, her lover had been with her.\n",
      "\"Perhaps I shall do so some day,\" said Miss Longestaffe, looking at her lover, and asking herself why she should not have been able to have the house and the money and the name of the wife without the troubles appertaining.\n",
      "It would be expedient that they should be married from the Melmottes' house, and the Melmottes would leave town some time in August.\n",
      "Unless married from the Melmottes' house, she must go down to Caversham for the occasion,--which would be intolerable.\n",
      "Mr. Brehgert, with the customary good-humour of his people, was satisfied with the answer, and went away promising that he would meet his love at the great Melmotte reception.\n",
      "A young lady gave a lock of her hair to Lord Nidderdale, although it was known that he was to marry Marie Melmotte.\n",
      "You know, don't you, she's going to marry one of these people?\"\n",
      "\"I heard about her marriage yesterday.\n",
      "In this case nobody really loved Melmotte and everybody did believe.\n",
      "Of course, Miss Carbury, I love him.\n",
      "I do love him so dearly!\n",
      "I hope you don't think I would have done it if I hadn't loved him better than anybody in the world.\n",
      "Don't you think that if a girl loves a man,--really loves him,--that ought to go before everything?\"\n",
      "You can understand what it is to love him as I do;--can't you?\"\n",
      "Hetta could not but sympathize with the affection manifested for her own brother, though she could hardly understand the want of reticence displayed by Marie in thus speaking of her love to one who was almost a stranger.\n",
      "If I thought that he loved me, I'd go through,--oh,--all the world for him.\n",
      "There's no disgrace in being in love.\n",
      "But it's very bad to get married without being in love.\n",
      "He is my brother,--and of course I love you for loving him.\"\n",
      "I should so like to be loved by you.\n",
      "Nobody loves me, I think.\n",

      "He is very nice; but he does not love me any more than he loves you.\n",
      "I suppose I shall marry that young man, though it will be very bad.\n",
      "That men should be thoroughly immoral, that they should gamble, get drunk, run into debt, and make love to other men's wives, was to him a matter of every-day life.\n",
      "He had almost fallen in love with Marie when he saw her last, and was inclined to feel the more kindly to her now because of the hard things that were being said about her father.\n",

      "The whole state of his mind had, she had thought, been visible to her,--had been intelligible, gentle, and affectionate.\n",

      "My brother is sure that he cannot--cannot--\" \"Cannot love me, Hetta!\n",
      "That other man never said that he loved me.\n",
      "Did he never love me,--once?\"\n",
      "Hetta could hardly say that her brother was incapable of such love as Marie expected, but she knew that it was so.\n",
      "If you had loved a man and told him of it, and agreed to be his wife and done as I have, could you bear to be told to think of him no more,--just as though you had got rid of a servant or a horse?\n",
      "I won't love him.\n",
      "I'll marry that other man to spite him, and then, when he finds that we are rich, he'll be broken-hearted.\"\n",
      "Tell me;--did he tell you to say that he did not love me?\"\n",
      "But did he say that I was to be told that he did not love me?\"\n",
      "Are you sure he does not love me?\"\n",
      "Hetta kissed her, tried to comfort her, and left her sobbing on the sofa.\n",
      "\"You can tell papa that I will marry Lord Nidderdale whenever he pleases.\"\n",
      "\"I'll marry Lord Nidderdale, or that horrid Mr. Grendall who is worse than all the others, or his old fool of a father,--or the sweeper at the crossing,--or the black man that waits at table, or anybody else that he chooses to pick up.\n",
      "It was nothing to him what the girl thought of the marriage,--if the marriage could now be brought about.\n",
      "Even though something might be all but proved against him,--which might come to certain proof in less august circumstances,--matters would hardly be pressed against a Member for Westminster whose daughter was married to the heir of the Marquis of Auld Reekie!\n",
      "Sir Orlando Drought, quite a leading Conservative, suggested that as Lord Nidderdale was very intimate with Mr. Melmotte he might do it.\n",
      "He was aware of the ruin that would be incurred by a marriage with Melmotte's daughter, if the things which had been said of Melmotte should be proved to be true.\n",
      "He was fully determined that the money should be paid down before the marriage was celebrated; but if his son were to secede now, of course no money would be forthcoming.\n",
      "And, after he was gone, there was silence at the table, for it was known that Lord Nidderdale was to marry Melmotte's daughter.\n",
      "That evening Madame Melmotte told her husband that Marie was now willing to marry Lord Nidderdale;--but she did not say anything as to the crossing-sweeper or the black footman, nor did she allude to Marie's threat of the sort of life she would lead her husband.\n",
      "There is a feeling, too, when a girl has been jilted,--thrown over, perhaps, is the proper term,--after the gentleman has had the fun of making love to her for an entire season, and has perhaps even been allowed privileges as her promised husband, that the less said the better.\n",
      "The girl does not mean to break her heart for love of the false one, and become the tragic heroine of a tale for three months.\n",
      "\"Then, by heaven, he shall answer it to me,\" Sir Felix had said very grandly, when his sister had told him that she was engaged to a man who was, as he thought he knew, engaged also to marry another woman.\n",
      "If he says so, that is, if you and he both say that he is to marry that woman,--I will not see Mr. Montague again.\n",
      "\"Montague,\" he said, assuming all the dignity of demeanour that his late sorrows had left to him, \"I believe I am right in saying that you are engaged to marry that American lady, Mrs.\n",
      "I am not going to marry Mrs. Hurtle.\n",
      "On the other hand, it is the dearest wish of my heart to marry your sister.\n",
      "When he made that half promise of marriage in Mrs. Pipkin's hearing, he had said that he would come again on the morrow.\n",
      "\"He would marry me out and out immediately, if I'd have him,\" continued Ruby, who perhaps thought that her honest old lover should not be spoken of as being altogether of no account.\n",
      "But I detest him,\" said Ruby, shaking her pretty head, and inclining herself towards her aristocratic lover's shoulder.\n",
      "This took place in the back parlour, before Mrs. Pipkin had ascended from the kitchen prepared to disturb so much romantic bliss with wretched references to the cold outer world.\n",
      "They must be to fix a day for the marriage, and to let her know where they were to live, and to settle what dress she should wear,--and perhaps to give her the money to go and buy it!\n",
      "Mrs. Hurtle had given it as her decided opinion that Sir Felix would not really mean to marry Ruby Ruggles unless he showed himself willing to do so with all the formality of a written contract.\n",
      "You don't mean to marry her.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Hurtle had heard often of Sir Felix Carbury, and was quite as certain as Mrs. Pipkin that he did not mean to marry Ruby Ruggles.\n",
      "She only barely connected him with that Roger Carbury who, she knew, was Paul's great friend, and she had as yet never heard that Hetta Carbury was the girl whom Paul loved.\n",
      "Should he not marry me, I am as I was before.\n",
      "What could it matter whether this young man was left in a belief that she was, or that she was not, about to be married?\n",
      "And what additional harm would be done to John Crumb, or what increase of anger engendered in that true lover's breast, by one additional evening's amusement?\n",
      "\"Then I shall,\" said Ruby linking herself on to her lover's arm.\n",
      "She was on her lover's arm, in her best clothes, and going to have a dinner given to her.\n",
      "And her lover had told her that he had ever so many things,--ever so many things to say to her!\n",
      "It was on a Friday evening, an inauspicious Friday, that poor Ruby Ruggles had insisted on leaving the security of her Aunt Pipkin's house with her aristocratic and vicious lover, in spite of the positive assurance made to her by Mrs. Pipkin that if she went forth in such company she should not be allowed to return.\n"

      "A man may desire that the woman he loves should hear the record of his folly,--so that, in after days, there may be nothing to be detected; so that, should the Mrs. Hurtle of his life at any time intrude upon his happiness, he may with a clear brow and undaunted heart say to his beloved one,--\"Ah, this is the trouble of which I spoke to you.\"\n",

      "But of course we can't be friends when you have married--Mrs.\n",
      "\"Nothing on earth would induce me to marry her.\"\n",

      "It was to be supposed that he had loved some woman before; but, as the world goes, that would not, could not, affect her.\n",

      "Even yet, after all that had passed, although she had consented to marry Lord Nidderdale, though she had been forced by what she had learned to despise Sir Felix Carbury, there was present to her an idea that she might escape with the man she really loved.\n",

      "But her fingers lingered over it as she touched it, and she would fain have kissed it, had she not told herself that she would have been disgraced, even in her solitude, by such a demonstration of affection.\n",

      "He was engaged to marry the girl, and there was nothing of which he could accuse her.\n",
      "Of course he could not marry her now.\n",
      "She herself, as well as all others, had known that she was to be married for her money, and now that bubble had been burst.\n",
      "But then that would be tantamount to a written confession that he had made her an offer of marriage, and he feared that Melmotte,--or Madame Melmotte on his behalf, if the great man himself were absent, in prison,--might make an ungenerous use of such an admission.\n",
      "At this time the young lord was living with his father, and the two had now met by appointment in order that something might be settled between them as to the proposed marriage.\n",

      "But no one knew so well as he did the fact that all the attention latterly given by Paul to the American woman had by no means been the effect of love, but had come from a feeling on Paul's part that he could not desert the woman he had once loved, when she asked him for his kindness.\n",

      "She was wretched because she thought that while her lover was winning her love, while she herself was willingly allowing him to win her love, he was dallying with another woman, and making to that other woman promises the same as those he made to her.\n",

      "No doubt he had now come to talk about his love,--and in order that his confessions might not be made before all the assembled haymakers, Roger Carbury hurried to meet him.\n",
      "It seemed to be his idea, that on arriving in London he would at once take Ruby away to church and be married to her out of hand.\n",
      "She had accepted me, and therefore I am justified in feeling sure that she must have loved me.\n",
      "She supposes that I have willingly been passing my time with Mrs. Hurtle during the last two months, although during that very time I have asked for and have received the assurance of her love.\n",
      "Nevertheless, as you appeal to me on a certain point for evidence which I can give, and which you say no one else can give, I do acknowledge that, in my opinion, Mrs. Hurtle's presence in England has not been in accordance with your wishes, and that you accompanied her to Lowestoft, not as her lover but as an old friend whom you could not neglect.\n",

      "It is right that I should tell you that I was a short time since engaged to marry him, but that I have found myself obliged to break off that engagement in consequence of what I have been told as to his acquaintance with you.\n",
      "Then she had parted with him, refusing either to hear or to say a word of farewell, and had told Mrs. Pipkin that she was no longer engaged to be married.\n",
      "It was certainly marvellous to her that the man who had so long been her own lover and who had parted with her after such a fashion should write such a letter to her.\n",
      "Her only present friend was Mrs. Pipkin, who treated her with the greatest deference, but who was never tired of asking questions about the lost lover.\n",
      "Nothing ever troubles me so much as broken love.\n",
      "Nevertheless she did not doubt but that she could tell the story after such a fashion as to make it impossible that the girl should marry him,--if she chose to do so.\n",

      "She had assured herself, when she found that Hetta was disposed to quarrel with her lover and to send him back his brooch, that \"things would come round,\" that Paul would be forgotten quickly,--or laid aside as though he were forgotten,--and that Hetta would soon perceive it to be her interest to marry her cousin.\n",
      "Who were the happy people that were driven neither by ambition, nor poverty, nor greed, nor the cross purposes of unhappy love, to stifle and trample upon their feelings?\n",
      "Lady Carbury reiterated to herself the assertion that she was manifestly doing a mother's duty by her endeavours to constrain her girl to marry such a man.\n",
      "Among them they had robbed her of her lover.\n",
      "Do you think, mamma, that after I had owned to you that I loved a man,--after I had owned it to him and, worst of all, to myself,--I could have myself separated from him, and then not think about it?\n",
      "It accused her of being too much concerned for her son to feel any real affection for her daughter.\n",
      "In what little you see around you do you think that girls are generally able to marry the men upon whom they set their hearts?\"\n",
      "\"Then a girl is to marry without stopping even to think whether she likes the man or not?\"\n",
      "\"She should teach herself to like the man, if the marriage be suitable.\n",
      "No earthly inducement shall ever make me marry my cousin Roger.\n",
      "It is to me horrible that you should propose it to me when you know that I love that other man with my whole heart.\"\n",
      "But that which pained her most was the unrealistic, romantic view of life which pervaded all Hetta's thoughts.\n",
      "She had admitted to all around her that Sir Felix should not be her lover any more, and that John Crumb should be allowed to return.\n",
      "Was it that she thought that she would vindicate to her rival their joint lover's first choice, or that she was minded to teach the English girl that an American woman might have graces of her own?\n",
      "He can be full of youthful ardour one day, and cautious as old age itself the next.\n",
      "Surely he ought, if it is true that he had once promised to marry you.\"\n",
      "He did love me, but he had been talked out of his love by my enemies and his own friends long before he had ever seen you.\n",
      "I followed him here to England--because I loved him.\n",
      "He has misused me foully, and I have simply forgiven him; not because I am a Christian, but because I am not strong enough to punish one that I still love.\n",
      "She had told herself that her visit was to be made in order that she might be justified in her condemnation of her lover.\n",
      "Now she was told that however false her lover might have been to this other woman he had been absolutely true to her.\n",
      "What was it to Hetta that her lover had been false to this American stranger?\n",
      "It did not seem to her to be at all necessary that she should be angry with her lover on that head.\n",
      "You have told me that you love him dearly, as plainly as I have told you the same story of myself.\n",
      "She now got herself quickly out of the room, absolutely kissing the woman whom she had both dreaded and despised.\n",
      "That she would be an unfit wife for Paul Montague was certain to Hetta, but that he or any man should have loved her and have been loved by her, and then have been willing to part from her, was wonderful.\n",
      "As she walked quickly back to the railway station she brought herself to love her lover more fondly than she had ever done.\n",
      "It was her pride to give herself to the man she loved after this fashion, pure and white as snow on which no foot has trodden.\n",
      "Why should you grudge me my love?\"\n",
      "Ten days had passed since the meeting narrated in the last chapter,--ten days, during which Hetta's letter had been sent to her lover, but in which she had received no reply,--when two gentlemen met each other in a certain room in Liverpool, who were seen together in the same room in the early part of this chronicle.\n",
      "Even if it suited other ways, you know, I wouldn't marry her myself till I saw my way clearer out of the wood.\"\n",
      "\"I'm not thinking of marrying her,--if you mean that.\"\n",
      "It need hardly be said that Lord Alfred had too much good taste to interfere at such a time, although for some months he had been domestically intimate with the poor woman, or that Sir Felix would not be prompted by the father's death to renew his suit to the daughter.\n",
      "She was prone to love,--though, perhaps, not prone to deep affection.\n",
      "I've found out one or two that you don't love.\n",
      "That, however, was protracted till a day much later than he had anticipated before he had become intimate with Madame Melmotte and Marie.\n",
      "\"A man may be very well without one's wanting to marry him.\n",
      "I don't think I'll marry anybody.\n",
      "Do you think Fisker'd ask me to marry him if I hadn't got anything?\n",
      "Hetta Carbury, out of the fulness of her heart, having made up her mind that she had been unjust to her lover, wrote to him a letter full of penitence, full of love, telling him at great length all the details of her meeting with Mrs. Hurtle, and bidding him come back to her, and bring the brooch with him.\n",
      "But Hetta had owned that she loved him, had submitted to his caresses, and had been proud of his admiration.\n",
      "And Paul, though he did not probably analyze very carefully the character of his beloved, still felt instinctively that, having so far prevailed with such a girl, his prospects could not be altogether hopeless.\n",
      "But Hetta had written a second epistle,--not to her lover, but to one who received his letters with more regularity.\n",
      "Though she would not recognise Roger as a lover, she did acknowledge him to be the head of her family, and her own special friend, and entitled in some special way to know all that she herself did, and all that was done in regard to her.\n",
      "Though he was altogether unchanged himself, though he was altogether incapable of change,--though he could not rally himself sufficiently to look forward to even a passive enjoyment of life without the girl whom he had loved,--yet he told himself what he believed to be the truth.\n",
      "He had let time slip by with him too fast and too far before he had ventured to love.\n",
      "All this must be changed, should he be able to persuade himself to give his consent to the marriage.\n",
      "In such case Carbury must be the home of the married couple, as far as he could induce them to make it so.\n",
      "In such case, though he should never again be able to love Paul Montague in his heart of hearts, he must live with him for her sake on affectionate terms.\n",
      "She had simply told him that, whereas she had for certain reasons quarrelled with the man she had loved, she had now come to the conclusion that she would quarrel with him no longer.\n",
      "He would have the vacant hours of the journey in which to think of it all again, and tell himself whether it was possible for him to bring his heart to agree to the marriage;--and then he would see the people, and perhaps learn something further from their manner and their words, before he finally committed himself to the abandonment of his own hopes and the completion of theirs.\n",
      "She hurried up to him, and he at once took her in his arms and kissed her.\n",
      "He had never even kissed her hand.\n",
      "Her instinct told her immediately that such a greeting from him was a sign of affectionate compliance with her wishes.\n",
      "That this man should kiss her as her best and dearest relation, as her most trusted friend, as almost her brother, was certainly to her no offence.\n",
      "She could cling to him in fondest love,--if he would only consent not to be her lover.\n",
      "\"I love you so much for saying that.\"\n",
      "And now, sobbing as she was, overcome by the tenderness of her cousin's affection, anxious to express her intense gratitude, she did not know how first to mention the name of Paul Montague.\n",
      "\"I have come up,\" said he, \"to signify my adhesion to this marriage.\"\n",
      "\"I look upon her as engaged to marry Paul Montague,\" said Roger.\n",
      "\"The marriage is on every account objectionable,\" she said at last.\n"

      "In the meantime great preparations were going on down in Suffolk for the marriage of that happiest of lovers, John Crumb.\n",
      "When Mrs. Pipkin suggested that Ruby should be married from her house, he winked his eye as he declined the suggestion with thanks.\n",
      "He was of opinion that the marriage should be celebrated in Suffolk,--the feast being spread at Sheep's Acre farm, if Dan Ruggles could be talked into giving it,--and if not, at his own house.\n",
      "When both the ladies explained to him that this last proposition was not in strict accordance with the habits of the fashionable world, John expressed an opinion that, under the peculiar circumstances of his marriage, the ordinary laws of the world might be suspended.\n",
      "She was brought up to be kissed, and having been duly kissed she retired again among the children, having only expressed one wish of her own,--namely, that Joe Mixet might not have anything to do with the affair.\n",
      "But Mrs. Pipkin told him with a laugh that he didn't know anything about it, and when the 14th of August was named he only scratched his head and, muttering something about Thetford fair, agreed that he would, yet once again, allow love to take precedence of business.\n",
      "If Tuesday would have suited the ladies as well he thought that he might have managed to combine the marriage and the fair, but when Mrs. Pipkin told him that he must not interfere any further, he yielded with a good grace.\n",
      "Before the day arrived, old Ruggles had been constrained to forgive his granddaughter, and to give a general assent to the marriage.\n",
      "When John Crumb, with a sound of many trumpets, informed all Bungay that he had returned victorious from London, and that after all the ups and downs of his courtship Ruby was to become his wife on a fixed day, all Bungay took his part, and joined in a general attack upon Mr. Daniel Ruggles.\n",
      "And he, moreover, was persuaded to receive Mrs. Pipkin and Ruby at the farm for the night previous to the marriage.\n",
      "This very necessary arrangement was made by Mr. Mixet's mother, a most respectable old lady, who went out in a fly from the inn attired in her best black silk gown and an overpowering bonnet, an old lady from whom her son had inherited his eloquence, who absolutely shamed the old man into compliance,--not, however, till she had promised to send out the tea and white sugar and box of biscuits which were thought to be necessary for Mrs. Pipkin on the evening preceding the marriage.\n",
      "Ruby had demanded that Joe Mixet should not be among the performers, and John Crumb, with the urbanity of a lover, had assented to her demand,--as far, at least, as silence can give consent.\n",
      "\"You didn't ever go for to--kiss her,--did you, Joe?\"\n",
      "Then he conducted Mrs. Hurtle in an omnibus up to the Inn, and afterwards himself drove Mrs. Pipkin and Ruby out to Sheep's Acre; in the performance of all which duties he was dressed in the green cutaway coat with brass buttons which had been expressly made for his marriage.\n",
      "\"Oh Ruby, Ruby,\" said Mrs. Pipkin, with solemnly persuasive voice, \"I hope you'll come to learn some day, that a loving heart is better nor a fickle tongue,--specially with vittels certain.\"\n",
      "He himself went out to the farm and drove the bride and Mrs. Pipkin into the town, expressing an opinion that no hired charioteer would bring them so safely as he would do himself; nor did he think it any disgrace to be seen performing this task before his marriage.\n",
      "He smiled and nodded at every one, now and then pointing back with his whip to Ruby when he met any of his specially intimate friends, as though he would have said, \"See, I've got her at last in spite of all difficulties.\"\n",
      "He thoroughly enjoyed the ceremony, and would have liked to be married over and over again, every day for a week, had it been possible.\n",
      "I'd sooner have a kiss from you than all the wine as ever was swallowed.\"\n",
      "Then she did kiss him, \"as though she meant it;\" and when she returned with him to Bungay the next day, she had made up her mind that she would endeavour to do her duty by him as his wife.\n",
      "Her sister's marriage with Mr. George Whitstable was fixed for the first of September, a day which in Suffolk is of all days the most sacred; and the combined energies of the houses of Caversham and Toodlam were being devoted to that happy event.\n",
      "And she would shut herself up on the day of the marriage.\n",
      "Marriage had ever been so clearly placed before her eyes as a condition of things to be achieved by her own efforts, that she could not endure the idea of remaining tranquil in her father's house and waiting till some fitting suitor might find her out.\n",
      "It was beyond the scope of her mind to contemplate the chances of a life in which marriage might be well if it came, but in which unmarried tranquillity might also be well should that be her lot.\n",
      "And now when they deserted her in her real difficulty,--when they first told her to live at Caversham all the summer, and then sent her up to the Melmottes, and after that forbade her marriage with Mr. Brehgert,--it seemed to her that they were unnatural parents who gave her a stone when she wanted bread, a serpent when she asked for a fish.\n",
      "Why didn't you, among you, let me marry Mr.\n",
      "Why shouldn't I have married the man if I chose?\n",
      "\"You couldn't have loved him, Georgiana.\"\n",
      "Who thinks about love nowadays?\n",
      "I don't know any one who loves any one else.\n",
      "You won't tell me that Sophy is going to marry that idiot because she loves him!\n",
      "Did Julia Triplex love that man with the large fortune?\n",
      "When you wanted Dolly to marry Marie Melmotte you never thought of his loving her.\n",
      "\"I think a young woman should love her husband.\"\n",
      "When one has been going on for a dozen years trying to do something,--and I have never had any secrets from you,--then that you should turn round upon me and talk about love!\n",
      "\"You have not got to marry him.\"\n",
      "Because Sophy is going to be married to that oaf, you are become so proud of her that you haven't half a thought for anybody else.\"\n",
      "I tell you fairly, mamma, that I shall write to Mr. Brehgert and tell him that I am quite ready to marry him.\n",
      "\"Of course it is a come-down to marry a curate,--but a clergyman is always considered to be decent.\"\n",
      "The preparations for the Whitstable marriage went on without any apparent attention to the intimacy which was growing up between Mr. Batherbolt and Georgiana.\n",
      "Mr. Longestaffe returned home only on the eve of his eldest daughter's marriage, and with him came Dolly.\n",
      "Great trouble had been taken to teach him that duty absolutely required his presence at his sister's marriage, and he had at last consented to be there.\n",
      "It was a great thing that one of the girls should be married, and Dolly had brought down an enormous china dog, about five feet high, as a wedding present, which added materially to the happiness of the meeting.\n",
      "Lady Pomona had determined that she would tell her husband of those walks in the park, and of other signs of growing intimacy which had reached her ears;--but this she would postpone until after the Whitstable marriage.\n",
      "But at nine o'clock on the morning set apart for that marriage, they were all astounded by the news that Georgiana had run away with Mr. Batherbolt.\n",
      "When the fact was first known it was almost felt, in the consternation of the moment, that the Whitstable marriage must be postponed.\n",
      "The marriage was not postponed.\n",
      "But the fugitives could not be brought back, and with some little delay,--which made the marriage perhaps uncanonical but not illegal,--Mr. George Whitstable was made a happy man.\n",
      "But then as a thief he had been so comfortable that his absence was regretted with a tenderness almost amounting to love even by those who had suffered most severely from his rapacity.\n",
      "One day, before the Whitstable marriage, when it was understood that the club would actually be closed on the 12th August unless some new heaven-inspired idea might be forthcoming for its salvation, Nidderdale, Grasslough, and Dolly were hanging about the hall and the steps, and drinking sherry and bitters preparatory to dinner, when Sir Felix Carbury came round the neighbouring corner and, in a creeping, hesitating fashion, entered the hall door.\n",
      "He had nearly recovered from his wounds, though he still wore a bit of court plaster on his upper lip, and had not yet learned to look or to speak as though he had not had two of his front teeth knocked out.\n",
      "And now they say the girl is going to be married to Fisker.\n",
      "I'm going all the way down to Caversham next week to see my sister married, though I hate the place and hate marriages, and if I was to be hung for it I couldn't say a word to the fellow who is going to be my brother-in-law.\n",
      "But I've got so sick of this kind of life;--and then that railway Board coming to an end, and the club smashing up, and--\" \"Marie Melmotte marrying Fisker,\" suggested Dolly.\n",
      "\"How about getting married?\"\n",
      "Mrs. Hurtle had consented at the joint request of Mrs. Pipkin and John Crumb to postpone her journey to New York and to go down to Bungay and grace the marriage of Ruby Ruggles, not so much from any love for the persons concerned, not so much even from any desire to witness a phase of English life, as from an irresistible tenderness towards Paul Montague.\n",
      "Mrs. Pipkin, she thought, was less intellectual than any American woman she had ever known; and she was quite sure that no human being so heavy, so slow, and so incapable of two concurrent ideas as John Crumb had ever been produced in the United States;--but, nevertheless, she liked Mrs. Pipkin, and almost loved John Crumb.\n",
      "She loved Paul Montague with all her heart, and she despised herself for loving him.\n",
      "But yet she loved him for his very faults, telling herself that there was something sweeter in his English manners than in all the smart intelligence of her own land.\n",
      "He could change his love as often as he pleased, and be as good a lover at the end as ever;--whereas she was ruined by his defection.\n",
      "asked Mrs. Pipkin a day or two after their return from the Crumb marriage.\n",
      "Her curiosity had been satisfied, and her love of revenge had been sacrificed.\n",
      "I could not make her understand during one short and rather agonizing interview how you had allowed yourself to be talked out of your love for me by English propriety even before you had seen her beautiful eyes.\n",
      "Surely you would not have had me tell her that your conduct to me had been that of a loyal, loving gentleman.\n",
      "Though he is not a man whom I specially love,--though I know that he has been my enemy with you,--I shall return with him to San Francisco.\"\n",
      "\"They say also that Fisker will marry Miss Melmotte.\"\n",
      "Should I ever marry another man,--as I may do,--he must take me and this together.\n",
      "I do not see why I am to abandon the picture of the man I love because he becomes the husband of another woman.\n",
      "Having once said that I love you I shall not contradict myself because you have deserted me.\n",
      "Paul, I have loved you, and do love you,--oh, with my very heart of hearts.\"\n",
      "So speaking she threw herself into his arms and covered his face with kisses.\n",
      "Oh, Paul, my love;--my love!\"\n",
      "But to be told by a woman of her love,--without being able even to promise love in return,--to be so told while you are in the very act of acknowledging your love for another woman,--carries with it but little of the joy of triumph.\n",
      "Then he essayed to pull her towards him as though he would again kiss her.\n",
      "She had spoken the very truth when she said that she had loved him with all her heart.\n",
      "When the obsequious but still curious landlady asked some question about Mr. Montague, Mrs. Hurtle seemed to speak very freely on the subject of her late lover,--and to speak without any great pain.\n",
      "They had put their heads together, she said, and had found that the marriage would not be suitable.\n",
      "Fisker had become her devoted servant,--not with that old-fashioned service which meant making love, but with perhaps a truer devotion to her material interests.\n",
      "Of Fisker she was afraid, thinking that the iniquity of giving all the money to Marie originated with him, in order that he might obtain it by marrying the girl.\n",
      "She thus was in possession of a treasure of her own,--though a treasure small in comparison with that of the younger woman; and the younger woman had promised that in the event of her marriage she would be liberal.\n",
      "\"My dear,\" she said one day, asking the question in French, without any preface or apology, \"are you going to be married to Mr.\n",
      "You will marry Fisker if you like him.\n",
      "The romance of the thing was with her a good deal worn, and the material view of matrimony had also been damaged in her sight.\n",
      "She had fallen in love with Sir Felix Carbury, and had assured herself over and over again that she worshipped the very ground on which he stood.\n",
      "But she had taught herself this business of falling in love as a lesson, rather than felt it.\n",
      "After her father's first attempts to marry her to this and that suitor because of her wealth,--attempts which she had hardly opposed amidst the consternation and glitter of the world to which she was suddenly introduced,--she had learned from novels that it would be right that she should be in love, and she had chosen Sir Felix as her idol.\n",
      "She certainly was not now in love with Sir Felix Carbury.\n",
      "Then she had as it were relapsed into the hands of Lord Nidderdale,--one of her early suitors,--and had felt that as love was not to prevail, and as it would be well that she should marry some one, he might probably be as good as any other, and certainly better than many others.\n",
      "From the moment of her father's death she had never dreamed that he would marry her.\n",
      "But all this had not made her much in love with matrimony generally.\n",
      "She had contrived to learn that, in the United States, a married woman has greater power over her own money than in England, and this information acted strongly in Fisker's favour.\n",
      "At these interviews, which were devoted first to business and then to love, Madame Melmotte was never allowed to be present.\n",
      "\"Did she not come over here to marry some one else?\"\n",
      "\"And perhaps I may go on to say that if I could go on board that ship as your accepted lover, I could do a deal more to make you comfortable, particularly when you land, than just as a mere friend, Miss Melmotte.\n",
      "\"But you would enter San Francisco, Miss Melmotte, under such much better auspices,--if I may be allowed to say so,--as a married lady or as a lady just going to be married.\"\n",
      "\"I shouldn't think of being married till I had been there a while and looked about me.\"\n",
      "I like you very well, but I'm not going to take a leap in the dark, and I'm not going to marry a pig in a poke.\"\n",
      "Well;--yes; you may give me a kiss I suppose now if you care about it.\"\n",
      "It was understood up at Hampstead that he was engaged to Marie Melmotte,--and it soon came to be understood also that Madame Melmotte was to be married to Herr Croll.\n",
      "\"If he could only be married!\"\n",
      "Who is to marry him?\n",
      "She could not interest herself in Hetta's coming marriage, as that marriage was in direct opposition to one of her broken schemes.\n",
      "Mr. Broune had sent her son away, had forbidden her to write any more novels,--and had been refused when he had asked her to marry him!\n",
      "I have quite convinced myself,--not without some doubts, for you shall know all; but, still, I have quite convinced myself,--that such a marriage will best contribute to my own happiness.\n",
      "Of course he had renewed his offer of marriage, but he had done so in a tone which almost made her feel that the proposition could not be an earnest one.\n",
      "I never loved you better than I did for refusing me before, because I thought that you did so because it was not right that I should be embarrassed by your son.\"\n",
      "\"But I shall love you better still for accepting me now,--if you will accept me.\"\n",
      "Then she remembered that first kiss,--or attempted kiss,--when, with a sort of pride in her own superiority, she had told herself that the man was a susceptible old goose.\n",
      "Nor could she quite understand now whether she had been right then, and that the man's feelings, and almost his nature, had since changed,--or whether he had really loved her from first to last.\n",
      "\"I am not proposing to myself to marry you for your money.\n",
      "This man who had thus bound her to him, who had given her such assured proofs of his affection and truth, was one of the considerable ones of the world; a man than whom few,--so she now told herself,--were greater or more powerful.\n",
      "It was at any rate decided that they were to be married, and the time fixed for the marriage was to be the following spring.\n",
      "Now, to his thinking, Paul Montague had stolen his cloak, and were he, Roger, to give way in this matter of his love, he would be giving Paul his coat also.\n",
      "But still he had gone down with her to Lowestoft as her lover, and, to Roger's thinking, a man who could do that was quite unfit to be the husband of Hetta Carbury.\n",
      "But not the less was his conviction strong that Hetta ought to know the truth, and to be induced by that knowledge to reject her younger lover.\n",
      "But then over these convictions there came a third,--equally strong,--which told him that the girl loved the younger man and did not love him, and that if he loved the girl it was his duty as a man to prove his love by doing what he could to make her happy.\n",
      "What did love mean if not that?\n",
      "What could be the devotion which men so often affect to feel if it did not tend to self-sacrifice on behalf of the beloved one?\n",
      "But if this were done simply with the object of winning her, where was that real love of which sacrifice of self on behalf of another is the truest proof?\n",
      "That he would never marry he was quite sure.\n",
      "Roger felt that he had still much to say to his cousin before her marriage which could be said in the country much better than in town, and he wished to teach her to regard Suffolk as the county to which she should be attached and in which she was to find her home.\n",
      "Where would you be if after all you were to marry?\"\n",
      "\"I shall never marry.\"\n",
      "I think very highly of your cousin, and I have no reason to think otherwise than well of the gentleman whom she intends to marry.\n",
      "After all, though love is a wonderful incident in a man's life, it is not that only that he is here for.\n",
      "Of course you will be married at Carbury?\"\n",
      "Then, after that, let this be your home,--so that you should learn really to care about and to love the place.\n",
      "With all his love to her and his good-will to them both, he could not bring himself to say that Paul Montague should be Squire of Carbury.\n",
      "He did not endeavour to exact from her any promise, but having explained his purposes, kissed her as he would have kissed a daughter, and then left her and rode home without going into the house.\n",
      "As to his love for Hetta, and his old hopes, and the disappointment which had so nearly unmanned him, he said not another word to his fortunate rival.\n",
      "Roger indeed made a solemn resolution that to Paul he would never again speak of Hetta as the girl whom he himself had loved, though he looked forward to a time, probably many years hence, when he might perhaps remind her of his fidelity.\n",

      "Behind the school, and running down to the little river Pin, there is a spacious cricket-ground, and a court marked out for lawn-tennis.\n",
      "No doubt a good deal was done to make the externals of the place alluring to those parents who love to think that their boys shall be made happy at school.\n",
      "It had been the Doctor's scheme to find a married gentleman to occupy this house, whose wife should receive a separate salary for looking after the linen and acting as matron to the school,--doing what his wife did till he became successful,--while the husband should be in orders and take part of the church duties as a second curate.\n",
      "A gentleman, when he is married, does not often wish to dispose of the services of his wife.\n",
      "Then he had taken orders, and had some time afterwards married, giving up his Fellowship as a matter of course.\n",
      "Mr. Peacocke, while living at Oxford, had been well known to a large Oxford circle, but he had suddenly disappeared from that world, and it had reached the ears of only a few of his more intimate friends that he had undertaken the duties of vice-president of a classical college at Saint Louis in the State of Missouri.\n",
      "He loved Oxford with all his heart, and some years since had been heard to say hard things of Mr. Peacocke, when that gentleman deserted his college for the sake of establishing himself across the Atlantic.\n",
      "But he was one who thought that there should be a place of penitence allowed to those who had clearly repented of their errors; and, moreover, when he heard that Mr. Peacocke was endeavouring to establish himself in Oxford as a \"coach\" for undergraduates, and also that he was a married man without any encumbrance in the way of family, there seemed to him to be an additional reason for pardoning that American escapade.\n",
      "So it came to pass that although the Doctor and Mr. Peacocke were really intimate, and that something of absolute friendship sprang up between the two ladies, when Mr. Peacocke had already been more than twelve months in Bowick neither had he nor Mrs. Peacocke broken bread in the Doctor's house.\n",
      "And now, O kind-hearted reader, I feel myself constrained, in the telling of this little story, to depart altogether from those principles of story-telling to which you probably have become accustomed, and to put the horse of my romance before the cart.\n",
      "The elder of these, when he was still little more than a stripling, had married Ella Beaufort, the daughter of another ruined planter in his State.\n",
      "She had been only sixteen when her father died, and not seventeen when she married Ferdinand Lefroy.\n",
      "That which the man had done, and that which he had not done, had been of such a nature as to solve all bonds of affection.\n",
      "She had already allowed herself to speak of the man as one whose life was a blight upon her own; and though there had been no word of out-spoken love from her lips to his ears, he thought that he might succeed if it could be made certain that Ferdinand Lefroy was no longer among the living.\n",
      "The woman was a bigamist,--that is, if any second marriage had ever been perpetrated.\n",
      "And he, resolving, as no doubt he would have done under any circumstances, that he must quit the city of his adoption,--he should have left her with such material sustenance as her spirit would have enabled her to accept, should have gone his widowed way, and endured as best he might the idea that he had left the woman whom he loved behind, in the desert, all alone!\n",
      "He had come within her ken, and had loved her without speaking of his love.\n",
      "Everything might still be open to him,--except the love of another woman.\n",
      "DURING the last six months Mr. Peacocke's most intimate friend at Bowick, excepting of course his wife, had been one of the pupils at the school.\n",
      "He was thus in a measure compelled to accede to the request made to him, and Lord Carstairs was received back at Bowick, not without hesitation, but with a full measure of affectionate welcome.\n",
      "Then he described his own life,--both before and after his marriage.\n",
      "\"Well enough, I think, when we were first married.\n",
      "She had been married before, you know.\n",
      "To cherish you, to comfort you, to make the storm less sharp to you,--that has already been my duty as well as my pleasure.\n",
      "FERDINAND LEFROY, the man who had in truth been the woman's husband, had, during that one interview which had taken place between him and the man who had married his wife, on his return to St. Louis, declared that his brother Robert was dead.\n",
      "He had seen Ferdinand alive at St. Louis after his marriage, and by seeing him, had been driven away from his home back to his old country.\n",
      "If Ferdinand had been ever so much dead, and that marriage at St. Louis had been ever so good, still she'd been my sister-in-law.\"\n",
      "\"And he knows, no doubt, all about you and my sister-in-law;--how you came and married her when she was another man's wife, and took her away when you knew as that other man was alive and kicking?\"\n",
      "You may, or you mayn't, have been fooled by some one down in Texas when you went back and married her in all that hurry.\n",
      "He had been aware that a schoolmaster with a wife to whom he was not in truth married must be out of place in an English seminary such as this.\n",
      "I have offered you the right hand of an affectionate brother-in-law.\"\n",
      "What have we done but clung together as a man and woman should who have loved each other, and have had a right to love?\n",
      "I was wrong from the first in supposing that the nature of my marriage need be of no concern to others, but to herself and to me.\"\n",
      "Then Mr. Peacocke told the story, beginning with all those incidents of the woman's life which had seemed to be so cruel both to him and to others at St. Louis before he had been in any degree intimate with her.\n",
      "\"Did she know that you loved her?\"\n",
      "\"Had you told her that you loved her?\"\n",
      "Then I went back to St. Louis,--and we were married.\"\n",
      "I think she had learnt to love me as I had learnt to love her.\"\n",
      "If he kept the man he must keep him resolving that all the world should know that he kept him, that all the world should know of what nature was the married life of the assistant in whom he trusted.\n",
      "In such case he must say something of this kind to all the world; \"I know that they are not married.\n",
      "\"Not married,\" said Mrs. Wortle, when she heard the story.\n",
      "They were married.\n",
      "It was not their fault that the marriage was nothing.\n",
      "\"Not married properly!\n",
      "What should I have done if such had happened to me when we had been six months married?\"\n",
      "\"Not till she knew it,\" said the wife who had been married quite properly.\n",
      "According to his own story, he seems, up to that time, to have been affectionate and generous.\"\n",
      "\"We will grant that he put himself right by his marriage, though in that, no doubt, there should have been more of caution.\n",
      "He knew that his marriage had been no marriage.\n",
      "\"Not though that man who was her husband should now be dead, and he should again marry,--legally marry,--this woman to whom he has been so true and loyal?\"\n",
      "According to the strict law of right and wrong the two unfortunates should have parted when they found that they were not in truth married.\n",
      "But then would not he, Dr. Wortle himself, have been guilty of similar deceit had it fallen upon him to have to defend a woman who had been true and affectionate to him?\n",
      "Let them marry, and repent their sins, and go away from the spot they had contaminated, and earn their bread in some place in which there need be no longer additional sin in concealing the story of their past life.\n",
      "It was evident to her, though the Doctor seemed to see nothing of it, that the young lord was falling in love.\n",
      "\"But his word would not suffice for another marriage ceremony.\"\n",
      "He had become a scholar in his youth, not from love of scholarship, but as a means to success.\n",
      "\"I shall always regard them as married.\"\n",
      "It is for the sake of charity,--for the dear love of Christ, that I ask you to do it.\n",
      "This was the Lady Margaret Momson, a daughter of the Earl of Brigstock, who had, thirty years ago, married a young clergyman.\n",
      "\"What a romance this is, Mrs. Wortle,\" she said, \"that has gone all through the diocese!\"\n",
      "Mary might marry well, and £20,000 would probably assist her in doing so.\n",
      "She was a quiet, silent little woman, whom the Bishop had married in the days of his earliest preferment, and who, though she was delighted to find herself promoted to the society of the big people in the diocese, had never quite lifted herself up into their sphere.\n",
      "We might just as well live like pagans, and do without any marriage services, as they do in so many parts of the United States.\"\n",
      "It is her presence there,--the presence of a woman who has falsely pretended to be married, when she knew very well that she had no husband.\"\n",
      "Fancy,--a woman living there as house-keeper with a man as usher, pretending to be husband and wife, when they knew all along that they were not married!\"\n",
      "Now Lady Anne Clifford was a sweet, confiding, affectionate, but not very wise woman.\n",
      "He had gone as a Classical Professor to a college in the United States;--a rash thing to do, no doubt;--and had there married a widow, which was rasher still.\n",
      "Then it turned out, as no doubt you have heard, that her former husband was alive when they were married.\n",
      "If so, let him come back and marry the woman again before all the world.\n",
      "I shall be ready to marry them and to ask him and her to my house afterwards.\n",
      "There was too much of romance in the story, too good a tale to be told, for any such hope.\n",
      "\"It is implied,\" said the Doctor, \"that I allowed Mr. Peacocke to preach in my church after I knew his marriage was informal.\"\n",
      "It is to be hoped that the reader has already learned as much as that;--a man with a kind, tender, affectionate nature.\n",
      "She loved to see him shine.\n",
      "This man is much flattered if it be given to be understood of him that he falls in love with every pretty woman that he sees;--whereas another will think that he has been made subject to a foul calumny by such insinuation.\n",
      "\"He passes all the morning in the school whipping the boys himself because he has sent Mr. Peacocke away, and then amuses himself in the evening by making love to Mr. Peacocke's wife, as he calls her.\"\n",
      "Dr. Wortle, when he read and re-read the article, and when the jokes which were made upon it reached his ears, as they were sure to do, was nearly maddened by what he called the heartless iniquity of the world; but his state became still worse when he received an affectionate but solemn letter from the Bishop warning him of his danger.\n",
      "An affectionate letter from a bishop must surely be the most disagreeable missive which a parish clergyman can receive.\n",
      "In answer to this the Bishop, in a note much shorter and much less affectionate than his former letter, said that he did not wish to name any metropolitan newspaper.\n",
      "This I can only do by publishing in a court of law all the circumstances in reference to my connection with Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke.\n",
      "\"'Amo' in the cool of the evening,\" certainly meant making love.\n",
      "To accuse a clergyman of a parish, and a schoolmaster, of making love to a lady so circumstanced as Mrs. Peacocke, no doubt was libellous.\n",
      "did he really think that I was making love to the woman; did he doubt that I was treating her and her husband with kindness, as one human being is bound to treat another in affliction; did he believe, in his heart, that I sent the man away in order that I might have an opportunity for a wicked purpose of my own?\n",
      "If once he should succeed in getting the Bishop into court as a witness, either the Bishop must be crushed or he himself.\n",
      "He had liked the opportunity of writing that affectionate letter.\n",
      "\"We could bring the Bishop into court?\"\n",
      "It had seemed to him that there was no possible reason why he should not fall in love as well as another.\n",
      "Nothing more sweet, nothing more lovely, nothing more lovable than Mary Wortle had he ever seen.\n",
      "\"I have come here to ask if you can love me.\"\n",
      "She really did not know whether she could love him or not.\n",
      "Why shouldn't she have been able to love him?\n",
      "But she knew that she ought not to love him, whether able or not.\n",
      "His father and mother would not expect him to fall in love, at any rate till he had taken his degree.\n",
      "And they certainly would not expect him to fall in love with the daughter of his tutor.\n",
      "She had an idea that, circumstanced as she was, she was bound by loyalty both to her own father and to the lad's father not to be able to love him.\n",
      "She thought that she would find it easy enough to say that she did not love him; but that was not the question.\n",
      "As for being able to love him,--she could not answer that at all.\n",
      "\"If they say that it's all right at Carstairs, then will you love me?\"\n",
      "Mary, when she found herself safe within her own room, could not refrain from asking herself the question which her lover had asked her.\n",
      "\"Could she love him?\"\n",
      "She didn't see any reason why she couldn't love him.\n",
      "It would be very nice, she thought, to love him.\n",
      "Not for a moment did she tell herself that she would love him.\n",
      "She did not understand all the differences in the world's ranks quite as well as did her father, but still she felt that because of his rank,--because of his rank and his youth combined,--she ought not to allow herself to love him.\n",
      "There was no reason why the son of a peer should not marry the daughter of a clergyman.\n",
      "Lord Bracy had sent him there to be taught Latin and Greek, and had a right to expect that he should not be encouraged to fall in love with his tutor's daughter.\n",
      "It was not that she did not think herself good enough to be loved by any young lord, but that she was too good to bring trouble on the people who had trusted her father.\n",
      "\"He is such a nice boy,\" said Mrs. Wortle, who, in all her anxiety, could not but like the lad the better for having fallen in love with her daughter.\n",
      "If a gardener was seen idling his time, or a housemaid flirting with the groom, that certainly would be told to the Doctor.\n",
      "He came on purpose to make a regular declaration of love to Mary.\"\n",
      "\"If Carstairs were but three or four years older,\" said the Doctor, proudly, \"Lord Bracy would have much to be thankful for in the attachment on the part of his son, if it were met by a return of affection on the part of my daughter.\n",
      "\"I am afraid she must not dream of her young lover.\"\n",
      "Therefore Mary did not in truth think of loving her young lover.\n",
      "Then had come this little episode in her life which seemed to lend it a gentle tinge of romance.\n",
      "But had she inquired of her bosom she would have declared that she had not been in love.\n",
      "There was no reason why his daughter should not marry an earl's son and heir.\n",
      "If this youth should show himself to be more constant than other youths,--which was not probable,--and if, at the end of three or four years, Mary should not have given her heart to any other lover,--which was also improbable,--why, then, it might come to pass that he should some day find himself father-in-law to the future Earl Bracy.\n",
      "When you read those abominable words did they induce your lordship to believe that I had been guilty of the inexpressible treachery of making love to the poor lady whose misfortunes I was endeavouring to relieve, and of doing so almost in my wife's presence?\n",
      "Then why had the Bishop written in that severely affectionate and episcopal style?\n"

      "This, indeed, it was to have a lover.\n",
      "Now she loved him.\n",

      "Mr. Phineas Finn was the gentleman's name--which statement may be necessary to explain the term of endearment which was occasionally used in speaking of him.\n",
      "\"But he married when he went away, and he can't afford it,\" said Mr. Bonteen, another keen expectant.\n",
      "Now Mr. Bonteen had never loved Mr. Finn.\n",
      "After various turmoils he had achieved a competency, and had married the girl of his heart.\n",
      "When in London he had often told himself that he was sick of it, and that he would better love some country quiet life.\n",
      "Has it not been written in a former book how this Lady Laura had been unhappy in her marriage, having wedded herself to a man whom she had never loved, because he was rich and powerful, and how this very Phineas had asked her to be his bride after she had accepted the rich man's hand?\n",
      "She had the baby with her when he came into the room, and at once greeted him as an old friend,--as a loved and loving friend who was to be made free at once to all the inmost privileges of real friendship, which are given to and are desired by so few.\n",
      "She has no father or mother, and lives when she is at home with a married sister, about seventy years older than herself, Mrs.\n",
      "She's engaged to be married.\"\n",
      "There were many others with whom he had been intimate--Barrington Erle, Laurence Fitzgibbon, Mr. Monk, a politician who had been in the Cabinet, and in consequence of whose political teaching he, Phineas Finn, had banished himself from the political world;--from none of these had he received a line till there came that letter summoning him back to the battle.\n",
      "Who is there that can write letters to all his friends, or would not find it dreary work to do so even in regard to those whom he really loves?\n",
      "A Horace Walpole may write to a Mr. Mann about all things under the sun, London gossip or transcendental philosophy, and if the Horace Walpole of the occasion can write well and will labour diligently at that vocation, his letters may be worth reading by his Mr. Mann, and by others; but, for the maintenance of love and friendship, continued correspondence between distant friends is naught.\n",
      "If they were to marry what would become of them?\"\n",
      "Why should this woman of whom they were speaking love him so dearly?\n",
      "She was highly born, greatly gifted, wealthy, and a married woman, whose character, as he well knew, was beyond the taint of suspicion, though she had been driven by the hard sullenness of her husband to refuse to live under his roof.\n",
      "When one sees such shipwreck it makes a woman doubt whether she ought to marry at all.\"\n",
      "And yet men expect that women shall put on altogether new characters when they are married, and girls think that they can do so.\n",
      "Look at this Mr. Maule, who is really over head and ears in love with Adelaide Palliser.\n",
      "And yet he has the effrontery to suppose that she will adapt herself to his way of living if he marries her.\"\n",
      "\"Then they are to be married?\"\n",
      "A girl almost always likes a man who is in love with her,--unless indeed she positively dislikes him.\n",
      "\"That's because you are not in love with him, Lady Chiltern.\"\n",
      "At Tankerville coal was much loved, and was not thought to be dirty.\n",
      "No other subject seemed at the moment to have any attraction in Tankerville.\n",
      "If the blow would come softer from his hands than from ours, with less of a feeling of injury to those who dearly love the Church, should we not be glad that he should undertake the task?\"\n",
      "If there must be a bill, would you rather that it should be modelled by us who love the Church, or by those who hate it?\"\n",
      "\"I am convinced at any rate of this,\" said Mr. Daubeny; \"that by sacrificing something of that ascendancy which the Establishment is supposed to give us, we can bring the Church, which we love, nearer to the wants of the people.\"\n",
      "Mr. Bunce was a privileged person, and Mrs. Bunce made up for his apparent rudeness by her own affectionate cordiality.\n",
      "Now Lord Chiltern was again his very intimate friend.\n",
      "Since that he had been a married man, and those special drawing-rooms and those wonderful words had in no degree actuated him in his choice of a wife.\n",
      "In former days he had been very intimate in that house, having received from both of them much kindness, mingled, perhaps, with some touch of severity on the part of the lady.\n",
      "Mr. Low gave his old friend a bottle of his best wine, and in all friendly observances treated him with due affection.\n",
      "He is one of those men who, on marrying, assume that they have at last got a person to do a duty which has always hitherto been neglected.\n",
      "It is hardly possible that you in your heart should love a Protestant ascendant Church.\n",
      "He grounds his demand on no affection of his own, on no presumption that any affection can remain with me.\n",
      "He has never even told me that he loves me; but he is persistent in declaring that those whom God has joined together nothing human should separate.\n",
      "There should be much awe mixed with the love felt for him.\n",
      "When once a woman is married she should be regarded as having thrown off her allegiance to her own sex.\n",
      "\"That's what we call flirting.\"\n",
      "Flirting I take to be the excitement of love, without its reality, and without its ordinary result in marriage.\n",
      "This playing at caring has none of the excitement, but it often leads to the result, and sometimes ends in downright affection.\"\n",
      "I once did think that you intended to love me.\"\n",
      "\"Does love go by intentions?\"\n",
      "I shall never intend to love any one.\n",
      "If I ever love any man it will be because I am made to do so, despite my intentions.\"\n",
      "The Church, which had been, which was, so truly beloved;--surely that must be beyond the line!\n",
      "Ratler himself almost felt that he loved the Church.\n",
      "I have never understood, and certainly have never sanctioned, that breach of my wife's marriage vow which has led to her withdrawal from my roof.\n",
      "He had first gone to Loughlinter, not as Lady Laura's guest,--for Lady Laura had not then been married, or even engaged to be married,--but on her persuasion rather than on that of Mr. Kennedy.\n",
      "When he had loved another woman this friend had resented his defection with all a woman's jealousy.\n",
      "When I married a wife, she became bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh.\n",
      "You were in love with her once, Mr.\n",
      "I was in love with Lady Laura Standish.\"\n",
      "It isn't a decent thing for a young unmarried man to go half across Europe to see a lady who is separated from her husband, and who was once in love with him;--I mean he was once in love with her.\n",
      "He had often been happy in the Earl's house, but the happiness had not sprung from any love for the man himself.\n",
      "It was two years since he had seen this woman, and when they had parted there had been more between them of the remembrances of old friendship than of present affection.\n",
      "She had said severe things to him,--telling him that he was cold, heartless, and uninterested, never trying even to please him with that sort of praise which had once been so common with her in her intercourse with him, and which all men love to hear from the mouths of women.\n",
      "She had repudiated him, first as a lover, then as a friend; and he had hitherto never been able to gauge the depth of the affection for him which had underlaid all her conduct.\n",
      "Let sorrow be ever so deep, and love ever so true, a man will be cold who travels by winter, and hungry who has travelled by night.\n",
      "To see a man eat and drink, and wear his slippers, and sit at ease in his chair, is delightful to the feminine heart that loves.\n",
      "When I heard the other day that a girl had herself visited the room prepared for a man in her mother's house, then I knew that she loved him, though I had never before believed it.\n",
      "Phineas, as he stood there, was aware that this woman loved him dearly.\n",
      "She had embraced him, and given her face to him to kiss.\n",
      "Women had loved him, and had told him so; and he had been made happy, and also wretched, by their love.\n",
      "But he had never taken pride, personally, to himself because they had loved him.\n",
      "I should have loved my baby better than all the world, but I should have been silent about him.\n",
      "But I think she always loved Oswald.\n",
      "She refused him again and again, because she thought it wrong to run a great risk, but I knew she would never marry any one else.\n",
      "\"There has been nothing for you to tell,--since you blurted out your short story of love that day over the waterfall, when I tried so hard to stop you.\"\n",
      "It was not my engagement or my marriage that has made the world a blank for me.\"\n",
      "\"It was your marriage,\" he said, gruffly.\n",
      "\"It was, and has been, and still will be my strong, unalterable, unquenchable love for you.\n",
      "He remembered many things, but even to her in his present mood he could not allude to them;--how he had kissed her at the Falls, how she had bade him not come back to the house because his presence to her was insupportable; how she had again encouraged him to come, and had then forbidden him to accept even an invitation to dinner from her husband.\n",
      "And he remembered too the fierceness of her anger to him when he told her of his love for Violet Effingham.\n",
      "I should never under any circumstances marry again.\n",
      "I have passed the period of a woman's life when as a woman she is loved; but I have not outlived the power of loving.\n",
      "I told myself that love after all should be a servant and not a master, and I married my husband fully intending to do my duty to him.\n",
      "\"It was my fault,--mine; for I never loved him.\n",
      "And I knew when I went to Loughlinter that it was you whom I loved.\n",
      "I never deserted you as regarded your interests, though what little love you had for me was short-lived indeed.\n",
      "And so entire had been the cure, that you went to the first woman with the tale of your love for the second.\"\n",
      "Violet Effingham was not the girl to marry this man or that at the bidding of any one;--was she?\"\n",
      "I think you cannot but love me a little when you know how entirely I am devoted to you.\n",
      "But when did worth create love?\n",
      "You will love again, of course.\"\n",
      "I tried to blaze into power by a marriage, and I failed,--because I was a woman.\n",
      "A woman should marry only for love.\n",
      "Then she threw herself into his arms, and he pressed her to his heart, and kissed first her forehead and then her lips.\n",
      "But it is not my love that I will kill.\n",
      "The marriage was a misfortune.\n",
      "He had not thanked her for her love when she expressed it, and he did not do so afterwards.\n",
      "I should bid you come here,--only that stupid people would say that you were my lover.\n",
      "I want you to marry, and you must tell her all the truth.\n",
      "If I can I will love her almost as much as I do you.\n",
      "And if I live to see them, I will love your children as dearly as I do you.\n",
      "She held his hand tight within her own for some seconds, and looked into his face with an unutterable love.\n",
      "The parsons must be respected, and the great Church-of-England feeling of the people must be considered with affectionate regard.\n",
      "With grave and slow and sober earnestness, with loving touches and soft caressing manipulation let the beautiful old Church be laid to its rest, as something too exquisite, too lovely, too refined for the present rough manners of the world!\n",
      "It is hardly more than romantic.\n",
      "Surely had he done so there would have been fit occasion for another embrace.\n",
      "If any woman loved her husband beyond all things Lord Chiltern's wife did, and ever had done so.\n",
      "\"I remember mamma saying, before she was mamma, you know,\" said Lady Baldock, \"that Mr. Finn was very nice indeed, only he was a Papist, and only he had got no money, and only he would fall in love with everybody.\n",
      "Does he go on falling in love with people, Violet?\"\n",
      "\"Never with married women, my dear.\n",
      "In her desire to save a man whom she had loved from the ruin which she thought had threatened him, she had--offered him her hand.\n",
      "They have been saying ever so long that the old Duke of Omnium means to marry her on his deathbed, but I don't suppose there can be anything in it.\"\n",
      "Lord Chiltern was very short with her, not loving Lady Gertrude.\n",
      "It had been hinted to him that the Duke wanted to marry the lady, but that rumour he had never believed.\n",
      "I don't know how it was that we became intimate;--but we did, and then I formed a sort of friendship with Lady Glencora; and somehow it has come about that we have been a great deal together since.\"\n",
      "Nay;--I love him.\n",
      "\"Simply from love of the man.\n",
      "Now Mrs. Atterbury painted pictures, copied Madonnas, composed sonatas, corresponded with learned men in Rome, Berlin, and Boston, had been the intimate friend of Cavour, had paid a visit to Garibaldi on his island with the view of explaining to him the real condition of Italy,--and was supposed to understand Bismarck.\n",
      "And, moreover, she desired that her sister Adelaide should marry a certain Count Brudi, who, according to her belief, had more advanced ideas about things in general than any other living human being.\n",
      "Adelaide Palliser had determined that she would not marry Count Brudi; had, indeed, almost determined that she would marry Gerard Maule, and had left her brother-in-law's house in Florence after something like a quarrel.\n",
      "She knew that she loved the man, and she swore to herself a thousand times that she would not be dictated to by her sister;--but was she prepared to accept the fate which would at once be hers were she now to marry Gerard Maule?\n",
      "Lady Chiltern was in favour of the marriage.\n",
      "The fortune, she said, was as much as Adelaide was entitled to expect, the man was a gentleman, was tainted by no vices, and was truly in love.\n",
      "A young man seeks a young woman's hand in marriage, because she has waltzed stoutly with him, and talked pleasantly between the dances;--and the young woman gives it, almost with gratitude.\n",
      "\"Where should we go and live if I did marry him?\"\n",
      "If we were married and taken away to the train he would only ask what place he should take the tickets for when he got to the station.\"\n",
      "Mr. Maule had not been reticent about his love towards Lady Chiltern, and came to her habitually in all his troubles.\n",
      "I suppose I shall marry some day.\n",
      "It was not within the compass of Miss Palliser's imagination to conceive that this man should intend to propose himself to her as her lover.\n",
      "\"Ever since I first saw you, Miss Palliser, I have been so much taken by you that,--that,--in point of fact, I love you better than all the women in the world I ever saw; and will you,--will you be Mrs.\n",
      "\"I haven't done anything out of the way,\" said the lover.\n",
      "Why she should thus despise Mr. Spooner, while in her heart of hearts she loved Gerard Maule, it would be difficult to explain.\n",
      "But Gerard Maule so wore his clothes, and so carried his limbs, and so pronounced his words that he was to be regarded as one entitled to make love to any lady; whereas poor Mr. Spooner was not justified in proposing to marry any woman much more gifted than his own housemaid.\n"

      "Could it be that at that moment she could have loved him as she now said she did, and that she should have been so cold, so calm, and so kind; while, at that very moment, this coldness, calmness, and kindness was but a thin crust over so strong a passion?\n",
      "How different had been his own love!\n",
      "Then he had retricked his beams, and before twelve months were passed had almost forgotten his love.\n",
      "But here was a woman who could calmly conceal her passion in its early days and marry a man whom she did not love in spite of it, who could make her heart, her feelings, and all her feminine delicacy subordinate to material considerations, and nevertheless could not rid herself of her passion in the course of years, although she felt its existence to be an intolerable burden on her conscience.\n",

      "She had specially required of him that he should make known to her his wife, should he ever marry again.\n",

      "Would he not sin against her and increase her difficulties if he addressed her with warm affection?\n",
      "He had been in love before he was eighteen, and very nearly succeeded in running away with the young lady before he went to college.\n",
      "He loved music, and pictures, and books, and pretty women.\n",
      "He loved also good eating and drinking; but conceived of himself that in his love for them he was an artist, and not a glutton.\n",
      "He had married early, and his wife had died soon.\n",
      "His daughter was married and in India.\n",
      "He had married, let us say for love;--probably very much by chance.\n",

      "At Maule Abbey there might be found a home for the married couple, and,--so thought Lady Chiltern,--the only fitting home.\n",
      "After all there could be no such great difficulty for a young married couple to live on £800 a year, with a house and garden of their own.\n",
      "Therefore there was still much more to be said when the father had completed the exposition of his views on marriage in general.\n",

      "As it was there had been something of romance in it,--though the romance of friendship at the bedside of a sick and selfish old man had hardly been satisfactory.\n",
      "Had not her dear friend, Lady Glen, agreed to bestow upon her support, fashion, and all kinds of worldly good things,--on condition that she never married the old Duke?\n",
      "She had liked Lady Glencora,--had enjoyed her friend's society, and been happy in her friend's company,--but she had always felt that Lady Glencora's attraction to herself had been simply on the score of the Duke.\n",

      "There was already between them an amount of acquaintance which justified his calling, and, perhaps, there had been on the lady's part something of that cordiality of manner which is wont to lead to intimate friendship.\n",
      "He was never married, you know.\"\n",
      "\"But was once willing to marry,\" said Mr. Maule, \"if all that we hear be true.\"\n",

      "Your affectionate friend, L. K. Phineas was obliged to console himself by reflecting that if she understood him of course that was everything.\n",
      "But then the pastors and men of God can only be human,--cannot be altogether men of God; and so they have oppressed us, and burned us, and tortured us, and hence come to love palaces, and fine linen, and purple, and, alas, sometimes, mere luxury and idleness.\n",
      "But for the bulk of those assembled the interest of the moment was greater even than the love of dinner.\n",
      "Mr. Bonteen was not a man who loved to be alone in public places, and was apt rather to make one of congregations, affecting popularity, and always at work increasing his influence.\n",
      "The manner in which you helped me has entitled you to my affectionate esteem.\n",
      "He did not doubt but that Bonteen had shown the correspondence to his friends, and that the Ratlers and Erles had conceded that he, Phineas, was put out of court by it.\n",
      "They two, Lord Cantrip and Phineas, had at one period been on most intimate terms together;--had worked in the same office, and had thoroughly trusted each other.\n",
      "Then he thought of Lady Laura, and her love for him.\n",

      "Lady Cantrip, though her husband was Mr. Gresham's most intimate friend, was altogether of this party, as was also the Duchess of St. Bungay, who understood nothing at all about it, but who had once fancied herself to be rudely treated by Mrs. Bonteen.\n",
      "Would such culpable quiescence have been allowed had not the unfortunate lady whose name we are unwilling to mention been the daughter of one of the colleagues of our present Prime Minister, the gentleman who fired the pistol another of them, and the presumed lover, who was fired at, also another?\n",
      "Phineas Finn, who was very sore and unhappy at this time, and who consequently was much in love with purity and anxious for severity, felt himself personally aggrieved by the acquittal.\n",
      "He was conscious of her dangerous love for him.\n",
      "They were married, and for some few months Mr. Emilius enjoyed a halcyon existence, the delights of which were, perhaps, not materially marred by the necessity which he felt of subjecting his young wife to marital authority.\n",
      "There had, however, been a rumour before her marriage that there was still living in his old country a Mrs. Emilius when he married Lady Eustace; and, though it had been supposed by those who were most nearly concerned with Lady Eustace that this report had been unfounded and malicious, nevertheless, when the man's claims became so exorbitant, reference was again made to the charge of bigamy.\n",
      "It had happened that, since her marriage with Mr. Emilius, Lady Eustace had become intimate with our Mr. Bonteen and his wife.\n",
      "She had been at one time engaged to marry Lord Fawn, one of Mr. Bonteen's colleagues, and during the various circumstances which had led to the disruption of that engagement, this friendship had been formed.\n",
      "She was rich, beautiful, and clever; and, though her marriage with Mr. Emilius had never been looked upon as a success, still, in the estimation of some people, it added an interest to her career.\n",
      "She acknowledged that in old days, when they were both young, she had been acquainted with a certain Yosef Mealyus, at a time in which he had been in the employment of a Jewish moneylender in the city; but,--as she declared,--she had never been married to him.\n",
      "He was piteous, argumentative, and at first gentle; but when Mr. Bonteen somewhat rashly told him that the evidence of a former marriage and of the present existence of the former wife would certainly be forthcoming, he defied Mr. Bonteen and his evidence,--and swore that if his claims were not satisfied, he would make use of the power which the English law gave him for the recovery of his wife's person.\n",
      "Now, it certainly was the case that Lady Eustace had married the man without any sufficient precaution as to keeping her money in her own hands, and Mr. Emilius had insisted that the rents of the property which was hers for her life should be paid to him, and on his receipt only.\n",
      "But lately the lawyers of the Eustace family,--who were not, indeed, very fond of Lady Eustace personally,--came forward for the sake of the property, and guaranteed the tenants against all proceedings until the question of the legality of the marriage should be settled.\n",
      "She expressed the most lavish affection for Mrs. Bonteen, and professed to regard Mr. Bonteen as almost a political god, declaring her conviction that he, and he alone, as Prime Minister, could save the country, and became very loud in her wrath when he was robbed of his seat in the Cabinet.\n",
      "She was neither true of heart or tongue, nor affectionate, nor even honest.\n",
      "Mr. Bonteen was tired of her, and Mrs. Bonteen was becoming almost sick of the constant kisses with which she was greeted; but Lizzie Eustace had got hold of them, and they could not turn her off.\n",
      "And there was Lady Glencora, and Violet Effingham, who married Lady Laura's brother, and that Madame Goesler, whom I hate,--and ever so many others.\"\n",
      "said Lady Eustace, taking hold of her friend's arm with almost frantic affection.\n",
      "It certainly had been believed that Yosef Mealyus was a married man, but he had brought the woman with him to Prague, and had certainly not married her in the city.\n",
      "But he had learned from various sources that the man and woman had been supposed to be married,--that she had borne the man's name, and that he had taken upon himself authority as her husband.\n",
      "There had been written communications with Cracow, and information was received that a man of the name of Yosef Mealyus had been married to a Jewess in that town.\n",
      "Altogether the case was full of difficulty, but it was thought that Mr. Bonteen's evidence would be sufficient to save the property from the hands of the cormorant, at any rate till such time as better evidence of the first marriage could be obtained.\n",
      "Many, however, were of opinion that Mr. Bonteen had been almost romantic in his friendship, and that the bright eyes of Lady Eustace had produced upon this dragon of business the wonderful effect that was noticed.\n",
      "He was more than ordinarily polite,--and was afterwards declared by the Duchess to have made love like an old gander.\n",
      "But a different feeling prevails at present;--a feeling so different, that we may almost say that a man in general society cannot speak even roughly to any but his intimate comrades without giving offence to all around him.\n",
      "And now, too, the facts of the past night, as they became known, seemed to make the crime more wonderful, more exciting, more momentous than it would have been had it been brought clearly home to such a wretch as the Bohemian Jew, Yosef Mealyus, who had contrived to cheat that wretched Lizzie Eustace into marrying him.\n"

      "Come, and let us leave this cold and ungenial country and go to the sunny south; to the islands of the blest,-- Mr. Emilius during his married life had not quite fathomed the depths of his wife's character, though, no doubt, he had caught some points of it with sufficient accuracy.\n",
      "What can purple do for us, and fine linen, and rich jewels, without love and a contented heart?\n",
      "Did the man after all know so little of her as to suppose that she, with all her experiences, did not know how to keep her own life and her own pocket separate from her romance?\n",
      "Can it be that you willingly doom me to such misery because of my love for you?\n",
      "Your truly most loving husband, JOSEPH EMILIUS.\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed;--and photographs of the registry of the marriage from the books of the synagogue at Cracow.\n",
      "\"For the money that we shall have to pay,\" said Mr. Camperdown, \"we might probably have got a dozen Bohemian ladies to come and swear that they were married to Yosef Mealyus at Cracow.\n",
      "\"I don't think Lord Fawn should be asked any more questions on the matter till he gives his evidence in court,\" said Mr. Camperdown.\n",
      "If I bring that coat into court I must make a charge against another man by the very act of doing so.\n",
      "\"I don't know that we can make much of it,\" he said, when he and Mr. Wickerby were alone, \"but it may be as well to bring it into court.\n",
      "But I would wish something more to be done than what you intimate.\"\n",
      "I have known men to be so acquitted that every man in court believed them to be guilty.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, Mr. Chaffanbrass, for the love of Heaven, let there be no quibbling.\"\n",
      "\"People think that the special branch of the profession into which I have chanced to fall is a very low one,--and I do not know whether, if the world were before me again, I would allow myself to drift into an exclusive practice in criminal courts.\"\n",
      "But you may be altogether independent, and, as a matter of right, walk into an open English court of law as one of the British public.\n",
      "\"I never was intimate with him.\"\n",
      "\"I am not presuming, Lord Fawn, that you so far derogated as to be intimate with this gentleman,--as to whom, however, I shall be able to show by and by that he was the chosen friend of the very man under whose mastership you now serve.\n",
      "He would have sacrificed much to establish the innocence of Phineas Finn,--not for the love of Phineas, but for the love of innocence;--but not even to do that would he have lied.\n",
      "He ventured to think that evidence as to the character of such a nature,--so strong, so convincing, so complete, and so free from all objection, had never yet been given in a criminal court.\n",
      "Then came his countryman Laurence Fitzgibbon, and Barrington Erle, and others of his own party who had been intimate with him.\n",
      "\"I have,\" he said, \"known Mr. Finn well, and have loved him dearly.\n",
      "There were many there who knew much of the history of her life,--who knew that passage in it of her early love,--for the tale had of course been told when it was whispered about that Lady Chiltern was to be examined as a witness.\n",
      "Then she stepped down, again took her husband's arm, and left the Court amidst a hum of almost affectionate greeting.\n",
      "There had been months in his life when he had almost trusted that he would succeed in winning that fair, highly-born, and wealthy woman for his wife; and though he had failed, and now knew that he had never really touched her heart, that she had always loved the man whom,--though she had rejected him time after time because of the dangers of his ways,--she had at last married, yet it must have been pleasant to him, even in his peril, to hear from her own lips how well she had esteemed him.\n",
      "It was of course known to everybody that Madame Goesler had undertaken a journey to Bohemia,--and, as many supposed, a roving tour through all the wilder parts of unknown Europe, Poland, Hungary, and the Principalities for instance,--with the object of looking for evidence to save the life of Phineas Finn; and grandly romantic tales were told of her wit, her wealth, and her beauty.\n",
      "The late Duke had left her everything at his disposal, and, it was hinted that they had been privately married just before the Duke's death.\n",
      "The Attorney and Solicitor-General had appeared to him resolved upon hanging him,--men who had been, at any rate, his intimate acquaintances, with whom he had sat on the same bench, who ought to have known him.\n",
      "And yet in his solitude he thought very much of the marvellous love shown to him by his friends.\n",
      "She was a widow,--not yet two months a widow; and though she did not and could not mourn the death of a husband as do other widows,--though she could not sorrow in her heart for a man whom she had never loved, and from whom she had been separated during half her married life,--yet the fact of her widowhood and the circumstances of her weeds were heavy on her.\n",
      "That she loved this man, Phineas Finn, with a passionate devotion of which the other woman could know nothing she was quite sure.\n",
      "When she was, as regarded her own means, a poor woman, she had refused to be this poor man's wife, and had given her hand to a rich suitor.\n",
      "She had been madly angry with him when he came to her with the story of his love for another woman, and had madly shown her anger; but yet she had striven to get for him the wife he wanted, though in doing so she would have abandoned one of the dearest purposes of her life.\n",
      "She had married him without loving him, but it seemed to her that he was in fault for that.\n",
      "Through it all she had been true in her regard to the one man she had ever loved, and,--though she admitted her own folly and knew her own shipwreck,--yet she had always drawn some woman's consolation from the conviction of her own constancy.\n",
      "She was a married woman, and could not be his wife.\n",
      "Then he had kissed her, and pressed her to his heart,--not because he loved her, but because he was generous.\n",
      "He did not assure her of his love,--but then she was a wife, and would have admitted no love that was sinful.\n",
      "When she returned to Dresden that night she stood gazing at herself in the glass and saw that there was nothing there to attract the love of such a man as Phineas Finn,--of one who was himself glorious with manly beauty; but yet for her sadness there was some cure, some possibility of consolation in the fact that she was a wife.\n",
      "Why speak of love at all when marriage was so far out of the question?\n",
      "But now she was a widow and as free as he was,--a widow endowed with ample wealth; and she was the woman to whom he had sworn his love when they had stood together, both young, by the falls of the Linter!\n",
      "There had certainly been no time then for other love than that which the circumstances and the sorrow of the hour demanded from their mutual friendship.\n",
      "Would not she have drunk up Esil, or swallowed a crocodile against any she-Laertes that would have thought to rival and to parallel her great love?\n",
      "Then, after a pause, she added, \"Of course he will marry her.\n",
      "It is nothing to me whom he marries--only,--only,--only, after all that has passed it seems hard upon me that his wife should be the only woman in London that I could not visit.\"\n"

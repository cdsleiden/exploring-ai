# Exploring AI Hands-on


During recent years, Artificial Intelligence has become a buzzword, in society in general, and within the library community as well. This interest within the library sector is understandable, as the growing sophistication of data science and AI is likely to have far-reaching implications for many of its existing tasks. This tutorial will explore both on the potential applications of AI and on the caveats that ought to be born in mind as libraries implement services based on AI.

Through a series of hands-on exercises, this tutorial  will clarify how data science, and more particularly, generative AI systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied within a library context. Such practical activities hopefully help you to develop a better understanding of what data science and AI entail at a concrete level. Topics will include the disambiguation and standardisation of references to named entities, the summarisation of lengthy texts, and the generation of metadata. 

This tutorial discusses the following openly available notebooks: 

1. [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hlS2cFYaUMu2x37eqN1zWvULa7j6MgWt?usp=sharing) 
 
2. [Large Language Models](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ORWjJhGHUGX1SPLTcGbfEI5IZ8lbj-MI#scrollTo=o0URVA8LqKWD)

3. [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A-u7vsdSgRJVxHvS3Atw9xZy_nMhbiWv?usp=sharing)

These notebooks can be run in [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Please familiarise yourself with [the basic functionaliities of this application]((https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NO2mCouxjAZCOpi94vknYL52gNhH2Zok#scrollTo=pLyX40ufpI9R)) before opening the notebooks.
